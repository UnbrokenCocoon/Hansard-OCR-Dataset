When he was a member of the board of admiralty , they had the book at that board . In this book were entered the original price , and the subsequent amount of repairs of each vessel . If the navy board were so lax in keeping their accounts , they were very reprehensible , and the more so , because quarterly accounts were transmitted from each of the dock yards , respecting the whole expence of repairs , and for timber therein . He stated what he knew to be the fact , and if the navy board on receiving these quarterly statements neglected to carry them on to account , they must have been very inattentive to their duty . by no means objected to the production of this or any other paper which the hon . admiral might think proper to move for . He should say , however , that of all the papers which the hon . admiral had yet moved for , only two or three were relevant to the charge which he meant to bring forward . The letter which his hon . friend had just read , was a proof to the house 726 of the mode and manner in which the hon . admiral moved for papers ; not one of the papers for which he had moved himself was of such a nature as not to be produced in ten days . As to the papers that had been last moved for by the hon . admiral , he could assure the house , upon the fullest investigation , that it was impossible , from the vast multiplicity of transactions which they comprehended , that any account could be produced , in any reasonable time , without material inconvenience to the public service . He hoped the hon . admiral would now move for all the papers which might be necessary to his case . As to himself , he should not look upon himself as bound to confine his charges to the heads which he had already stated . They should extend to a far greater length , and embrace the whole conduct of earl St. Vincent , during his administration of the admiralty , the system of terror which he continued throughoutâ€” . here called the hon . gent . to order , as entering into a discussion not immediately arising out of the question before the house wished only to explain the extent to which his motion might go , in compliance with what he understood to be the desire of the gentlemen opposite . He was anxious that it should not be understood that his motion was to be confined to the heads he had stated on a former day . Was so well aware of the consequence of putting any question to the hon . member , that he was not disposed to trouble the house any more on that head . He had found that questions would not lead to any direct answer , though they produced harsh language on the part of that hon . gentleman . The hon . member , no doubt , however undecided he might be at present , might during the summer make up his mind as to the course he should take , or regulate his future conduct , according to the suggestions of any person who might recommend to him any system of harsh proceedings . Without meaning any offence to the hon . gentleman . ( Mr. Jeffery ) , he thought he could more safely rely on the authority of his hon . friend ( Admiral Markham ) , as to the relevancy of the papers for which he moved ; and , therefore should not reply to the hon . gentleman 's observations on that head . He could not , however , but advert to the insinuations thrown out by his hon . friend opposite ( Mr , Dickinson ) , as to the difficulty of making out the accounts ; and he appealed to the house , whether , when a grave charge was brought against lord St. Vincent , such
