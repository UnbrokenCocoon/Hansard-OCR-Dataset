of the measure , which was in consequence carried almost immediately into effect ; and I have the satisfaction to say , that we are at this moment deriving very material benefit from it . Upon looking over the ordinary of the navy , I observed that there were a considerable number of sixty-four gun ships ; I therefore determined to see what could be done in regard to the repairing of such of them as could be readily taken in hand . Eight sixty-fours , one of the small seventy-fours , and fourteen frigates from forty-four to twenty-eight guns , were agreed for , and of those there are already several actually at sea , so expeditious have the merchant builders been in fulfilling their agreement . 'The sixty-fours are , I am 'aware , a class of ships which is a getting much out of fashion ; 84 but I am nevertheless of opinion , that it will be always necessary for this country to have a certain number of them , as they are the description of ships which is probably , under all circumstances , the best calculated for the service of the north and the east seas , and are , in respect of force , equal if not superior , to the major part of the Dutch marine.—Since the measure of repairing in the merchants ' yards was carried into effect , I further advised that ten seventy-four gun ships should be built there without delay , for the purpose of keeping up our fleet ; and , in giving this advice , I certainly expatiated most fully on the policy , as well as the expediency of the measure.—Your lordships may probably expect that I should explain the grounds on which I formed my opinion in favour of building and repairing in merchants ' yards . When I looked to the number of slips for building in the dock yards , I found there were only twenty-five in all . It may be said that these slips ought to have been appropriated to the purpose for which they were intended ; but I found that only five ships , as I stated before , had been ordered to be built by the late board of admiralty : I found also that , day after day , ships came in , requiring to be docked , repaired , and refitted.—In the course of ten months , that is , from the 15th of May , 1804 , to the date of the returns now on your lordships ' table , six hundred and one vessels have been docked , repaired , and refitted , one hundred and eighty-two of which were docked in the king 's yards , and forty-seven in merchants ' yards . May I not ask , then , whether it could have been possible to have brought forward new ships , by building in the king 's yards during , that period ; or whether it is possible to keep up our navy , by building in the king 's yards during the pressure of war ? If , my lords , in advising that recourse should be had to the merchants ' yards , I had been pursuing a new project of my own , I might have been more diffident of the measure ; but if I am blameable for recurring to the merchants ' yards for keeping up the British navy , I am so , with the example before me of lord Sandwich , lord Keppel , lord Howe , lord Chatham , and lord Spencer . During the whole period , comprising the naval administrations of those noble lords , commencing with the year 1771 , it was uniformly not only their respective opinions , that , during the pressure of war , recourse must be had to the merchants ' yards for the 85 purpose of keeping up our navy , but it was invariably their practice whenever great exertions were required.—Some of the best ships in the service were built in the merchants ' yards , and of the ships of the line
