the object of that motion to be similar to one that had been brought forward in another house , but more especially with the view to increase the number of Vessels of the smaller and lighter classes , of which we had not then by any means enough for the service for which such vessels were more particularly wanted , — namely , to contend against the flotillas which were collected at Boulogne , and other ports on the French , Flemish , and Dutch coasts . Serious apprehensions were entertained at that time upon this subject ; in consequence of which I thought it my duty to give my earliest attention to it.—With the view therefore of appeasing the clamour and removing the dissatisfaction , which , from the want of vessels of the description I have just mentioned , had been so generally expressed , I lust no time in ascertaining the exact state of our resources in so far as regarded every description of vessels , which were either then at the disposal of the crown , or which might be obtained in the shortest possible time ; and I found that to the force allotted for the service of the north sea , for the blockade of the enemy 's ports in the narrow part of the channel , and for the protection of our own coasts in that particular direction , considerable additions might speedily be made . I therefore desired that fifteen armed transports , which were lying at Spithead , and seven , which were in Loch Ryan , should be immediately ordered to join lord Keith , whose force , when I-came into office , amounted to one hundred ' and twenty-one ships and vessels of war , exclusive of hired ships and craft of various descriptions.—To the above twenty-two tired transports , which were all coppered , I found , that by giving a premium of not more than 8000l . a further addition might quickly be obtained of thirty-nine sloops 80 and gun-brigs , which , just before the change at the admiralty , had been contracted for . The whole of these . vessels were , in consequence of this encouragement , brought forward with the greatest expedition , some of them months , but all of them several weeks , earlier than they would have been furnished according to the terms of the ' contracts.—Besides the vessels already . mentioned , orders were given , as will be seen by the papers on your lordships ' table , to purchase and to build the ships , and Vessels therein described , amounting in the whole to seventy sail.—It was still thought necessary to make a further addition to this force , and with this view the gun-brigs and mortar vessels have been contracted for since the first of June last , as will be seen by a reference to that document : these amount to thirty-seven sail ; —so that the whole force either actually added , or in a state of forwardness , appears to amount to one hundred and sixty-eight vessels more than there were on the day of my succeeding to the office of first lord of the admiralty.—With regard to the expence incurred for the purchase of the vessels that were brought into the service , little can , I think , be said in objection to it , although the noble lord , who opened the debate , has endeavoured to lay considerable stress on that point , as well as upon the unfitness of some of those vessels , from the circumstance of their being a little crank from want of sufficient ballast , and from their not having exactly the qualities which vessels built especially for the purposes of war generally possess.—The Hindostan , Mediator , and Hyæna , the ships to which the noble lord particularly objected , are now all upon distant service , whither they have been detached with valuable convoys ; and such other of the purchased vessels.as are not now actually employed in the blockading squadrons off Boulogne , or off the Flemish and Dutch ports
