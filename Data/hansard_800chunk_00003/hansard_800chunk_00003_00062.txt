to suppress or keep from public discussion a subject to which they have themselves given such publicity , and therefore I trust there will not be any difference in opinion to prevent those proceedings , and other papers relating to this business , from being laid upon the table of this house . With permission of the house , I will beg leave to read captain Wood 's memorial to the lords commissioners of the admiralty , together with the legal opinions given upon a case , for the purpose of ascertaining how far the court martial decided according to their oaths , and according to the 18th article of war . `` The Memorial of Captain James Athol Wood , `` Humbly sheweth , that the sentence of the court martial lately held upon vice-admiral sir J. Duckworth having not only most honourably acquitted the vice-admiral of the several charges preferred against him , but having also declared in general and unqualified terms those charges to have been gross , unfounded , malicious , and scandalous , your memorialist would consider himself unworthy of the commission which he has the honour to bear in his majesty 's service , as well as wanting in that respect which he owes to the lords commissioners of the admiralty , were he not , with the greatest deference and respect , to state to their lordships , that so far from the charges which he preferred against vice-admiral Duckworth having been either gross , unfounded , malicious , or scandalous , your memorialist trusts he shall be able to satisfy your lordships , that such charges have been as fully substantiated as it was possible for them to be , under all those unfavourable circumstances under which your memorialist was placed.—With respect to the first charge , for oppression in superseding your memorialist in the command of the Acasta , under the pretext of appointing him to the Hercule , a ship of greater consequence , your memorialist begs leave to submit the following observations for your lordships ' consideration : after having been constantly and 195 actively employed under admiral Cornwallis , off Brest , from the commencement of the war , towards the end of last November your lordships were pleased to direct him to proceed to the West Indies with a large and valuable fleet ; and on the 2d of February your memorialist arrived with this fleet at Port Royal in Jamaica.—The second day after the arrival of your memorialist at that station , vice-admiral Duckworth gave him notice of his determination to remove your memorialist from the command of his own frigate the Acasta into the Hercule , 74-gun ship , at that time at sea ; alledging for so unusual and so cruel an exertion of power , not only the good of his majesty 's service , but his intention of promoting your memorialist to the command of a ship of superior class . It appears , not only from the evidence of captain Dunn , admiral Duckworth 's captain , by whom your lordships ' appointment was superseded , but also by the evidence of the admiral 's secretary , that admiral Dacres , long before the Acasta arrived , had declared his intention of hoisting his flag on board of the Hercule , and to carry with him his captain and officers . This fact admiral Duckworth never has denied ; and accordingly admiral Dacres did hoist his flag on board of the Hercule before your memorialist sailed from Jamaica.—It is therefore evident , that the reason which the vice-admiral assigned in his public letter for superseding your memorialist , namely , the good of the service , and giving him the Command of a ship of greater consequence , was false and groundless , and calculated merely to give a colour of justice to an act of the greatest stretch of power , cruelty , and oppression.—If the ostensible pretext , that the good of the service required the vice-admiral 's return to England on board of the Acasta , your memorialist was surely fully competent to have commanded to England that
