lads of an age when by law they would be incapable of making any disposition of property , nay even boys of 12 or 13 years of age , are permitted to surrender for life , all those advantages of which as yet they can not know 689 the value . In every point of view , therefore t his question deserves to be seriously entertained and enquired into by this house , who I maintain are perfectly competent to fora an accurate judgment upon . it , in all its bearings.—Another alteration which appear to me to be very necessary , with a view to diminishing the aversion which the people now have to , entering into the army , and which might , I am confident , be made without prejudice to its discipline , relates to the frequency of corporal punishments . It is , I am aware , a subject that requires being mentioned with delicacy and caution ; but having been before introduced by my right hon . friend , there can be no impropriety in my noticing it , and the less , as I have little more to say than merely to state my entire concurrence in all that I understand him to have said upon that occasion . I am fully convinced that , by a judicious revision of our military law , the frequency of these sanguinary punishments might be mitigated , and commuted for others of a less revolting nature , but equally effectual and sufficient for many of those offences which now expose a man to this severe and ignominious mode of punishment . When I say this , I beg that I may not be understood as reflecting in the smallest degree upon the conduct of regimental courts martial , by whose sentence they are inflicted . It is the law and the practice that has arisen out of it , that I find fault with , and not the conduct of those by whom it is administered . The frequency of these punishments must necessarily operate in a considerable degree to deter men from subjecting themselves to martial law.—Another subject , which I should earnestly recommend to the attention of the committee , is , the situation of the officers of the army . It would well become not only the liberality and justice , but also the wisdom , of parliament , to consider of the means of providing for them in a manner more adequate to the station which , not merely their own comfort , but the respectability of the army , and consequently the good of the state , requires that they should maintain in society . The pay of a subaltern of infantry is little more than what a livery servant costs his master ; and when they arrive at the rank of captain , a rank which many do not get beyond under twenty-five years hard service , and which , as it can easily be proved by the most simple calculation , the majority never get beyond at all , when they do arrive at that rank , their pay does not exceed 180 to 2001. per annum.—The king of Prussia , who , by the wisdom of his military institutions , raised 690 his army to a state of excellence that was rivalled by no other , and by that means raise his country to a rank which it otherwise never would have held amongst the powers of Europe , —that great man , wisely considering that no state can have a good army in which it is not respected , and that , in order to render it a respected and desirable profession it is necessary to hold out the prospect of a comfortable remuneration for their service to those who devoted themselves to it , —considering , too , that this prospect would be too distant , if confined , as it is with us , to the possession of a regiment , which few can aspire to , determined to make the situation of his captains a comfortable one , and such as to enable them
