nay in such a case , is it not almost certain , that the enemy would arrive again in the European seas long before our squadron that had gone in pursuit of him , perhaps even before it had quitted the West Indies , involved , as I suppose them in an arduous state of warfare ? After what we have seen , can we say that all this is an exagerated supposition ? why should they not effect their landing in Jamaica before the arrival of a fleet that left Europe nearly five weeks after them ? why should not a large fleet get back to a port in Europe as well as the Rochefort squadron ? but if the former of these events takes place , namely , the landing of 10,000 men in Jamaica , the enemy will have succeeded , either , in capturing that island , or at least in establishing in it a war , of which the ultimate issue will at best be precarious , but of which the enevitable consequences would be infinite mischief to the island , the suspension ( perhaps for many years after the enemy 's expulsion from it ) of the greater part of the advantages which we derive from that important colony , and a fatal drain of men from our regular army now at home : and therefore the probality of this first success as an independant operation is , under the present circumstances , in itself quite sufficient to account for his having determined on this active employment of a part of his force , whilst in the mean time the equipment of the Spanish navy , the augmentation of the French , and the other preparations for the invasion of Great Britain and Ireland are uninterruptedly carried on : and if , com- 668 bined with this first success , namely , the landing of such a force in Jamaica , the second supposition , namely , the safe return of these fleets , like the former , to Europe , should also be realised , it will then he found that , besides the advantage of having established a destructive war in the West Indies , which would probably terminate in the destruction for many years of the colony more important , to our commercial greatness perhaps than any that we possess , he would also have brought about , in our relative situations at home , a change highly advantageous to his further designs ; our three in Europe being greatly weakened , whilst his remained undiminished , for the detaching to or even 20,000 men to the colonies can not be considered as any diminution of the military force of the French in Europe , since their government has the power of replacing them and augmenting its army at pleasure . But this is not all ; I will go further , and however extravagant the idea , which I am going to state may appear to some , I am not afraid of stating it as one deserving of the serious attention of government : what I mean is , that if we were for an instant thrown off our guard at home in consequence of these distant attacks , the enemy 's fleets , after landing as I have supposed their troops in Jamaica , or other valuable foreign possessions , might unexpectedly make their appearance in such a situation as to gain a temporary superiority in the narrow seas , take possession of the anchorage of the downs , and bring over that immense army , which if in possession of that anchorage for a few days only , they would have ample means of transporting across the channel . A right hon . gent ( the secretary at war ) smiles I perceive , and probably considers this idea as very absurd . He may sneer at it if he pleases , but I hope that those near him who are in the cabinet , do not treat it with quite so much contempt . If the idea in itself is an absurdity , it is not
