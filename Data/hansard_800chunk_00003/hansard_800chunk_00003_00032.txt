, are also appropriated to the convoy of our foreign or coasting trade , whereby we have been enabled to allot , for other services , ships of superior qualities , which must necessarily have been appropriated for convoy , if we had not had recourse to this measure , which circumstances at the moment so imperiously called for . Upon this part of the subject now under your lordships ' consideration , I trust that this elucidation will be found to be satisfactory.—Having stated what I think will be sufficient to explain to your lordships the 81 grounds on which I was induced to recommend the increase of vessels of the smaller classes , and the measures taken for that Purpose , I will freely confess that , although the chief dissatisfaction prevalent in the public mind was on account of the deficiency of small vessels , my own apprehensions were infinitely stronger when I contemplated the state of the superior classes of ships , but more especially those of the line : and the more I looked into this subject , the more serious those apprehensions became.—I shall now state to your lordships how far measures have been taken to restore the British navy to that strength and vigour of which I do affirm it stood in need , and which the situation of the country required at the time I entered upon the duties of my office at the admiralty.—For the purpose of obtaining accurate information upon the subject , I desired that a return might be made out , of the number of ships of the line then in commission , together with their state and condition . This return was accordingly prepared , by which it appeared that the state of the ships of the line in employ was as follows : viz . thirty-seven , which might probably last five years ; twenty-seven , three years ; and seventeen were considered as fit only for home or limited service ; making altogether a total of eighty-one ships of the line.—Considering the situation in winch the country then stood , I do explicitly declare , that this was not such a state of the fleet as circumstances appeared to me to require . Eighty-one ships of the line were certainly inure than adequate in point of number to the ships of the enemy , including those both of France and Holland ; which , according to our intelligence , amounted to about sixty-five sail ; but the enemies ' ships might probably , in one respect , be considered as superior to those of this country , from the circumstance of their having been kept almost constantly in their own ports during the greater part of the late war , and being consequently in a better condition , than ours , which had been perpetually employed on the most active and arduous services . Many of our ships had been employed in the blockading service ; the tendency of which at all times , but particularly in.the winter season , and when the ships have been long in service , is to cause a rapid and destructive wear of those so employed . Besides , it is necessary to observe , that the report of the state and condition of our ships was drawn up 82 in rather too favourable a manner , as many , of them had been already a considerable time in service ; and though in the ten months subsequent to my entering upon the duties of my office , ten or eleven additional ships of the line were put into commission , they only sufficed to replace those which had been put out of commission in consequence of being unfit for further service . —Thus , at the end of ten months , notwithstanding this accession of fresh ships , the number of those of the line remained much the same as they were when I entered upon the duties of my office . But when I found , from the report to which I have alluded , what the situation of the navy really was , it naturally led
