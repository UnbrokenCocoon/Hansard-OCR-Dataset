; your memorialist begs leave most respectfully to submit to your lordships , that a door would in such a case be opened , and a most dangerous and extensive latitude given , to the greatest possible abuses . Under the name of `` presents , '' his majesty 's ships of war might be converted to the private emolument of individuals , to the utter ruin and destruction of the naval service of his majesty.—From this consideration , as well as for the purpose of satisfying himself and friends , that the sentence of the late court martial had been most unjust , founded upon most erroneous opinions , and had grossly injured and insulted the character and feelings of an officer , over whose conduct they had no cognizance ; your memorialist was induced to state a case for the opinion of the first lawyers in this country , a copy of which he begs leave to submit for their lordships ' information.—This case your memorialist begs leave to observe , has been drawn in the most favourable terms for the vice-admiral ; admitting that every article loaded by him on board of the Acasta , could be proved to have been intended for presents , and not for sale . Notwithstanding of which , the most eminent lawyers in England have given it as their opinion , that if the court martial had decided according to the 18th article of war , the vice-admiral must inevitably have been cashiered , and for ever rendered incapable of serving his majesty.—That the admiral 's conduct , in super-seding your memorialist in the command of the Acasta , was unjust , cruel , and oppressive , and that the lords commissioners of the admiralty had not deemed the charge unfounded , your memorialist is warranted in appealing to your lordships , having been pleased immediately on hearing of so unprecedented a stretch of power , to re-appoint your memorialist to the command of the Acasta ; a circumstance of which he was unacquainted at the time when he requested a court martial to be 198 held upon the vice-admiral.—That the sentence of the court martial , in acquitting the vice-admiral of the second charge , viz . loading on board of the Acasta , goods and merchandize not intended for the sole use of the ship , is highly illegal and unjust , and is in direct violation of two acts of parliament made for the express purpose of restraining naval officers from such unofficer-like practices , he is warranted in asserting , upon the first legal opinions of England herewith inclosed.—Under all these circumstances , and a due consideration of the harsh , cruel , and unmerited treatment which your memorialist has received , he trusts your lordships will be pleased to direct that the proceedings and sentence of this court martial , together with this memorial , be submitted for the opinion of his majesty 's law officers , or if , judged necessary , for that of his majesty 's judges , in order that your memorialist may have an opportunity of vindicating his character , and of obtaining that justice to which he may appear entitled : and your memorialist shall ever pray .
