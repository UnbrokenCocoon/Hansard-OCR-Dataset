the Spanish war was inevitable , though the obligation on the right hon . gent . will of course he still stronger , if it should appear that , by a different line of conduct , he might have avoided it . I am desirous of touching upon this part of the subject as cursorily as possible ; yet , in talking of the effects and consequences of the Spanish war , one can not help saying a few words respecting the extraordinary and disgraceful circumstances which immediately 654 preceded it : the former have indeed , in no inconsiderable degree , arisen out of the latter ; and , on the whole , they so naturally connect themselves in one 's mind , that it is extremely difficult to argue from the one without slightly noticing the other . I will admit that the Spanish government has given us sufficient grounds for declaring war , if we thought it our interest to do so : I will admit , too , that there appeared to be a great probability that they would he forced into a rupture with us , whenever France should deem it to be , on the whole , materially advantageous to her , and should not find herself restrained by any important considerations from insisting upon it : under these circumstances it was necessary for us to prepare ourselves for the event ; but , situated as we were , it was at the same time in the highest degree incumbent upon his majesty 's ministers to endeavour , as long as it should he possible , without dishonour , to persevere in such a system of moderation and forbearance as should make it difficult for the enemy to find a suitable occasion for the rupture . And I really believe , that , if we had abstained from that insulting and imperious conduct , and from those outrages and disgraceful acts which were . the forerunners of the declaration of war , if we had conducted ourselves with the moderation due to a brave and honourable , but unfortunate nation , the war might at least have been deferred : â€”The French and the Spanish governments might then have doubted , whether the Spanish nation , afflicted as it had been , and still was , by the hand of Providence , labouring as it still was under the dreadful calamities of that pestilential disease which has committed such ravages in that unfortunate country , and of scarcity amounting almost to famine , I say , sir , the government of France and of Spain might have doubted , whether under these circumstances the Spanish nation would have submitted to having the additional calamity of war wantonly forced upon them , without any aggression from us , or any possibility for their government to justify the measure as necessary for the preservation either of their interests or their honour . Thus , by pursuing a judicious and moderate conduct , we should have had good reason to hope that the period of a rupture with Spain would at least have been deferred ; and his majesty 's ministers , who contend ( whether justly or not is immaterial to this view of the subject ) that both our navy and army are in a state of progressive encrease , must surely admit , that , situated as we were , delay was advantageous . But even supposing 655 the war could not have been either avoided or postponed ; even supposing that nothing could have prevented France from making use of the ports , the arsenals , and the ships of Spain ; yet there is one most powerful element of war , which , without the aid of his majesty 's ministers , France could not have obtained , I mean the hearts of the people . Force might have added another nation lo the list of cur enemies , but it would have been an unwilling enemy , breathing more hostility against France who had driven them into the war , than against us who had done them no injury and offered
