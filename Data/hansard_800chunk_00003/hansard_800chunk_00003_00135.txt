enlistment and not by conscription , must he occasionally short ; but owing to the supernumeraries not having been accounted for in the papers on the table , he rather thought that they staved the deficiencies as greater than they really were . The regular army was at present greater than it ever was in this country of that army the disposeable force was larger ; of that disposeable force the infantry , and particularly the British infantry , were more numerous , independant of a volunteer force exceeding 400,000 men , which , whatever the hon . colonel might think of them , were in a state of spirit and determination which would render them formidable to any enemy that should dare to attack them . Compare our gross force with the highest point to which it reacted in 1802 , and it would be found to exceed that number by 5,100 men . Compare our present regular army with that existing on the 1st of January , 1804 : at that period it consisted of 150,500 men , it now amounted to 179,100 , making an increase in the last 18 months of 28,600 men . Of that number the disposable force was on the 1st of January , 1804 , 122,700 ; it was now 161,300. being an increase of 38,600 ; of the disposable force , the infantry ( which had been contended , and , fairly contended , to be of the most moment ) was on the 1st of January 1804 , 90,500 , it was now 121,700 , being an increase of 31,200 in the regular disposeable infantry , during the last 18 months . The number of foreign troops was pretty much the same at each period , the increase being nearly exclusively in British infantry . The hon . colonel 695 did not seem to attach so much consequence to the foreign troops in our pay as they deserved . Even the native troops in Ceylon were by no means contemptible ; the Sepoy 's had frequently shown themselves formidable . But what could the hon . colonel say against the Hanoverian troops , or those other continental regiments , who fighting undergen . Stuart in Egypt , had abundantly proved their bravery and discipline ? It was impossible for him , consistantly with his duty , to say any thing on the expedition that had been sent up the Mediterranean , except to express his surprise that the hon . colonel , in total ignorance of all the facts which had induced government to fit out that expedition , should take upon him unequivocally to condemn it . The hon . colonel 's statements of the general distribution and amount of our force in our foreign possessions was erroneous . In the accounts of June 1805 the artillery were nor included , but he compared them with those of January 1804 , in which they were included . The actual return of the troops now serving abroad was 69,300 men ; in Jan. 1804. they consisted only of 49,000 men , so that the actual increase of the number of troops serving abroad was not 16,000 as stated by the hon . colonel , but 20300.â€”With respect to the general deficiences at home , the hon . col. had truly stated them at 4,000 ; but was this surprising , when we had detached such numbers abroad ? Besides , examine the comparitive quality of the force in Great Britain now , and that in January 1804 . Whether we looked to the regular army , the militia , or the volunteers , no man of a candid mind but must admit , that so far from the means of defence which the country possessed being weaker at the present moment than they were at that period , they were much more powerful , and afforded much greater security ; and although he would not say that the danger of invasion was entirely gone by , he would certainly say , adverting to our naval and military force , that the danger was not near so considerable as it was
