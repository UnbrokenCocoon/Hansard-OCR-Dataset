ship which the lords of the admiralty had so long been pleased to entrust to his charge.—Thus , after serving in his majesty 's navy upwards of thirty years , without any alledged offence , but on the contrary the strongest testimonies of zealous services , your memorialist has been most oppressively and most unjustly deprived of the command of his majesty 's ship Acasta ; and , in aggravation to his grievances , compelled to beg and to intreat a passage to Europe on board of his own ship , in a situation very however , inadequate to his rank ; whereas two pas 196 sengers , totally unconnected with his majesty 's service , occupied his former cabin ; all of which tending to degrade and to lessen your memorialist in the eyes of a ship 's company , so long devoted and attached to your memorialist.—The second charge against the admiral was , for having , in violation of the 18th article of war , loaded on board of the Acasta various goods and merchandizes , otherwise than for the sole use of his majesty 's ship . In support of this second charge , your memorialist has proved by the admission of the admiral himself , that he had loaded on board of the Acasta eleven logs and two slabs of mahogany , measuring at least 16 tons ; about 150 1b . weight of Spanish snuff , of the value of upwards of 200 guineas ; from 30 to 40 casks of shaddocks and fruits , upwards of 20 pipes and puncheons of wine , rum , & c. & c. exclusive of liquors and various articles of household furniture , allowed to be 40 tons and upwards , but which , in the belief of your memorialist , exceeded 100 . By the evidence of captain Dunn , the Acasta appeared to him to have been so loaded and lumbered as to have resembled a West Indiaman , and that in direct violation to the printed instruction , the spirit-room prepared for preserving in safety his majesty 's spirits , had been cleared out , and the ship 's spirits removed into the hold , a very dangerous and insecure place , to make room for the vice-admiral 's wines and spirits . It has also been proved , that many of the seamen had been removed from their mess places and births , to stow betwixt decks logs of mahogany and articles of household furniture made up in the island of Jamaica , where , by the evidence of the joiner of the Hercule , he had been employed at the admiral 's pen three years.—By the 18th article of war , it is expressly declared , that if any officer of any or his majesty 's ships of war , shall receive on board , or permit to be received on board such ship or vessel , any goods or merchandizes whatsoever , excepting for the sole use of the ship or vessel , and being convicted thereof , shall be cashiered , and for ever afterwards rendered incapable to serve in the naval service of his majesty . Exclusive thereof , it is further enacted , that any officer so offending , or owner of such goods , shall be liable to forfeit the full value of such goods , to be recovered in a court of law . It is , however , evident from the sentence of this court martial , that nothing loaded on board 197 of the Acasta , were deemed by those who have so decided , goods or merchandizes , either , because they had not been loaded on board by merchants , or proof adduced of the vice-admiral 's intention to sell or to dispose of such goods . If under the head of `` goods or merchandize , '' the legislature only meant goods of which undoubted proof could be adduced of the officer 's intention to sell , and the evidence of such intention is to be the confession of the party accused , or the evidence of those connected with him
