, sir , to call the attention of the house to a subject , perhaps one of the most important to its own privileges that has ever been agitated within these walls . From the eleventh report of the commissioners of naval enquiry , it appears , that enormous sums of the public money have been raised by loans , and disbursed for alledged services , by order of his majesty 's ministers , without the permission of this house , and without any account laid before parliament of such disbursements . Sir , knowing , as we do , the opinion of the public without doors , expressed from every part of the nation , of the laudable vigilance exerted by the commissioners of naval enquiry , to whom other abuses have , been referred for investigation , and feeling , as we must , from recent abuses in the expenditure of public money , the necessity which exists , in times like the present , for exerting , with the utmost vigilance , the peculiar privilege which it is the province and the duty of this house at all times to exercise over the public finances ; yet , in calling the attention , of the house to this subject , . I do not mean they should pronounce judgment against the parties implicated , upon the mere evidence of the report itself ; for although the facts stated therein may have been proved to the satisfaction of the commissioners , and we have every reason to rely on their veracity , still I am inclined to think , the house , before it proceeds to , any measures against the parties implicated , ought to go into the enquiry ; and this will be the object of the motion which I shall have the honour of proposing this day . Sir , it can not be necessary for me to remind the house , that it is the bounden duty of parliament to watch over our constitution , and to take care that no inroads are made upon it by any minister , or any set of men ; and more especially that part which comes so peculiarly under We auspices of the house of commons , namely , the security of the public purse . Sir , it is impossible for any man to look at , the facts stated in the report on your table , any more than at those other facts of a similar nature , that have come under your consideration , and not to see that the grossest abuses have been committed ; and that scarcely any law has been passed for 57 the security of our constitution on those points , that has not been violated . I know not if it will be disputed , whether money can be raised and disbursed in this kingdom , for the service of the crown , without the consent of parliament ; but that large sums of money have been so raised and disbursed , we have seen from recent and undeniable facts . It , therefore , becomes highly necessary to ascertain whether loans of money can be raised from the people by the ministers of the crown , without the consent of parliament , consistently with the principles of the British constitution ; because scarcely a session of parliament passes without one or more votes enabling the minister to raise loans for the state upon exchequer bills ; and if it be the law of the constitution that loans can not be raised upon exchequer bills , without that permission , it certainly can not be legal to issue navy bills for the purpose . But though I may entertain no hopes of success in the motion which it is my purpose to offer , it is my duty to bring it forward , and at least to state to the house what former parliaments have done in similar cases , and what opinion they entertained of the power of ministers to raise public loans without their permission . It appears by a resolution of the house , passed on
