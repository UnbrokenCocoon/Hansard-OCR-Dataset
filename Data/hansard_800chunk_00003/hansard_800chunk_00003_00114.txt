the idea of invasion is now pretty generally treated with levity ; and I was seriously concerned a few days ago , when I heard a noble lord ( Castlereagh ) who is a cabinet minister , give it as his opinion that the war had now in a great measure changed its character , and that the enemy , who for a considerable time had appeared to have lost sight of the colonies , seemed now to be directing his principal elf-arts towards then . If the noble lord meant , that whilst the pressure had encreased abroad it had been lightened at home , in that opinion I hope that he stands alone in the cabinet . It he only meant to say that it had now become necessary for us to hare a larger force than before to protect our colonies , I perfectly agree with him ; but if his meaning was , as it appeared to me to be , that we may a without risk obtain those reinforcements abroad by a diminution of that force which was before . deemed necessary for our defence at home , I trust and hope that he does not find any of his colleagues of the same opinion . It the force we had in Europe last year was not mare than was requisite , it must now be two small : for , whilst the enemy 's general means of offence have encreased , I can discover nothing in the actual stare of the war which should induce us to suppose , that if he ever seriously entertained the project of invasion , he has now relinquished it . The mariner in which he is now conducting his operations does not appear to me to be inconsistant with the supposition that his ultimate views are still chiefly directed to and mainly intent upon the execution of that great enterprize . The expeditions which he is sending out to the attack of our colonies may be considered , not only in the light of independent operations highly important in themselves , but also perhaps as powerful diversions in favour of an intended attack upon great Britain and . Ireland , to which they not improbably may he the prelude . I say , sir , that if these expeditions are conducted with tolerable skill and vigour , they afford the enemy a double chance of success , either of which is sufficient to justify the enterprize ; first , the chance of striking a blow abroad Coat will do us great , perhaps irreparable mischief , and secondly , combined with this , the further chance of drawing to a great distance from home a considerable part of our naval forces and of our regular army . The for- 667 mer , supposing them even to have taken the right direction in pursuit of his expedition , may not be recalled in time to assist in frustrating his ulterior designs ; and the latter , on our present system , we have little hopes of replacing bet in a great length of time . Whilst we were indulging , as the noble lord seemed to do , in the idea that the project of invasion was given up , might it not happen that the enemy , after drawing a great part of our naval force in an uncertain pursuit of his expeditions , after establishing a dangerous war in our colonies , after landing for instance ( as he probably may do long before our squadrons reach the West indies ) 10 or r 12,000 men in Jamaica , where we have only between 3 and 4,000 troops to oppose him , â€”might it not happen , I say , that his fleet , quitting those seas as soon as the troops and stores were landed , should disappear before ours arrived there ? and , whilst our admiral remained for a time uncertain of their subsequent rout , and in that uncertainty unwilling to quit the theatre of so important a contest , and to abandon Jamaica to its fate , is it not probable ,
