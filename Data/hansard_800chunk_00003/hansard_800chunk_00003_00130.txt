by the test of experience ; and yet it appears , that until I lately moved for a return of the number of men annually lost to the company 's army in consequence of the term of service having expired , his majesty 's ministers had never thought of making so obvious an enquiry : and I am therefore inclined to suspect , that they have never very seriously turned their thoughts to the investigation of the subject . These returns have not indeed been made up in the manner that I had required ; —the men who returned from India in consequence of the expiration of their term , not being distinguished ( as my motion specified ) from these who were sent home in consequence of age , wounds , or other causes that rendered them unfit for active service : but I know from the experience of several years residence in that country , that very few men indeed quit India at the expiration of their first engagement , and that the annual loss of men occasioned by this mode of enlistment , is extremely trifling . It is not therefore upon this part of the subject that we are called upon blindly to defer to military authorities , since , by referring with more accuracy to the returns of the East India company 's army , and also perhaps to other documents that shew the average duration of a 688 soldier 's service in his majesty 's army , we may form our judgment of the probable annual loss that would result from the proposed regulation , upon that which is better than vague opinion , namely , upon past experience.—With respect to the other consideration , I mean the encreased facility of procuring recruits , I can not conceive how there can be two opinions , It can not , I think , he doubted , that there are many men , who , though they might be inclined to try the experiment of a military life for a few years , at the end of which they should have an opportunity of quitting it if thee pleased , . are however deterred from binding themselves to it for life . It is now looked upon as `` the bourne from which no traveller returns ; '' or , if here and there a solider does return to the place of his nativity , he comes back crippled or an invalid , worn out and covered with infirmities that render hint unfit for all enjoyment of life . In how different a light would the service appear to the people of the country , how different a picture would it exhibit , if this change , that has been so frequently proposed , was to be adopted , and was accompanied by other provisions for rendering the situation of a retired soldier an enviable condition . The men who quitted the army at the expiration of their service would then in fact be more effectual recruiters than it is possible to procure by any other means . The comfortable situation of a certain number of these men dispersed throughout the country , would hold out a pleasing and encouraging prospect to those to whom they should recommend to follow their example . And , sir , if the prospect of advantage to the army from the proposed change is so great , must it not be a great satisfaction to parliament to find itself authorized in sound policy and wisdom to adopt a practice so much more consistent with humanity , and so much more congenial to the spirit of our constitution ? Is it fitting that without some plea of strong necessity we should suffer that a man , because in a moment of thoughtlessness , caprice , or perhaps temporary distress , he enters into the army , should be deprived for life of the liberties and rights which the people of this country enjoy under that happy constitution , which we prize as so great a blessing ? —and not only men who have come to the years of discretion , but
