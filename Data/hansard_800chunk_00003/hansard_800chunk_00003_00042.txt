, in which he adverts to the shipwrights of the dock-yards at Woolwich and Deptford , who thought proper to discharge themselves . The noble lord says that great mischief has arisen from this circumstance , and from these men having gone to the merchants ' yards for employment . But before this point be conceded , he must shew that their services were indispensable at those yards ; he must also prove , that they would have been more useful in the king 's yards than they have been in the merchants ' yards . The fact is , that these people who thus discharged themselves , were , with but few exceptions , men on whom no dependence could be placed ; as it was doubtful , from their unsettled disposition , whether they would have continued , even supposing there had been no employment in the merchants ' yards.—However , notwithstanding the secession of these men , I have the satisfaction to observe that by the abstract account of the number of shipwrights borne in the king 's yards on the 1st of March last , there appears to be only sixty-seven less than there were on the 15th of May 1804 , the day on which the noble earl retired from the admiralty ; and since the 1st of March the numbers have been increasing : of the other descriptions of artificers , the numbers are augmented in most of the classes , and upon the aggregate , the increase ( including all descriptions of persons ) is no less than two hundred and sixty-eight since the 15th of May , 18O4 . The retreat of the Deptford and Woolwich men will , I apprehend , now be considered as a matter too insignificant to be repeated , even by those noble lords whose minds may , from partial or exaggerated reports , have received a contrary impression . At any rate , it 96 is , I trust , evident that no mischief whatever has arisen from this circumstance.— With regard to the supply of timber and stores for the navy ( upon which I have as yet only slightly touched ) , that is certainly an object worthy of the most serious consideration ; and I am most clearly of opinion , that the yards ought , if possible , to be kept completely supplied with stores of all descriptions sufficient for three years consumption.—During the ten months that I presided at the board of admiralty , it was my endeavour to obtain stores by every means that could be devised . But in order to ensure a regular supply , some settled plan must be adopted ; for while the profits of agriculture ( which must , most undoubtedly , he encouraged ) are so great , people will naturally prefer the speedy returns yielded by this mode of employing their lands , rather than turn their attention to the growth of timber , which , though ultimately of great value , is yet too slow in making a return for the capital so employed . It is evident that sonic general system ought to be adopted for securing a sufficient and permanent supply to our navy ; and in promoting such an object , I think we ought all to agree , whatever may he our differences of opinion on other points . Before I left the admiralty , I made no reserve of the sentiments I entertained as to what I thought essentially necessary in this respect—It only further remains for me briefly to advert to the allusions which the noble lord has repeatedly made in the course of his speech to the sixth report of the commissioners of naval enquiry . He says , he has only lately read that report ; and that the facts which it contains afford many strong additional reasons for going into the committee he recommends . If the noble lord , or those with whom he acts , be of that opinion , I can not help expressing my surprise at his not having given an earlier attention to it , as that report
