together with their observations and opinion thereupon , from time to time , to the house ; that the committee had examined the matters to them referred , and had come to several resolutions thereupon , which they had directed him to report to the house ; and he read the . report in his place , and afterwards delivered it in at the table , where the same was read ; and the resolutions of the committee are as followeth , viz `` Resolved , That the committee , having considered the documents and evidence which have been laid before them , are of opinion , that the petitioner has fully established the allegations of his petition . Resolved , that it is the opinion of this committee , that it would be proper to recommend to the house , that parliament should grant such farther compensation as shall seem adequate for the benefit of the petitioner and the other heirs-general of the seventh earl of Derby , according to the provisions of the act of the 7th of king James the First , and that such compensation should be charged on the revenue of the Isle of Man . '' did not wish at this moment to oppose the reception of this report , though he totally objected to its contents ; and his wish was , that the subject should undergo a full discussion in a committee of the whole house , and that the whole of the merits of the noble duke 's claims should be fairly and fully investigated . He hoped the house , in its attention to the claims of the Duke of Atholl , would not be unmindful to the complaints of a numerous and loyal body of his majesty 's subjects , though not represented in that house : and as it was the peculiar privilege of parliament as well to watch over the modes of raising money from the pockets of his majesty 's subjects , as to guard with vigilance its proper disbursement , so he trusted in this case the inhabitants of the Isle of Man would not be exposed to imposts , which it was not just they should pay , at the mere fiat of the noble duke , who claimed the privilege of taxing them just as he pleased , of his own mere will and caprice ; nor sutler the public money to be lavished in the payment of demands , not founded on any just or 54 reasonable title . At least he trusted , that before the house would assent to the report now offered , and founded on such a various multiplicity of items and documents , they would fully and fairly investigate the whole . This was not the first time those claims of the noble duke were brought forward ; they had been repeatedly urged , and every time in a new and different shape from the former . They came now forward upon a footing totally different from that on which they had been last submitted to his majesty 's privy council , who , after four years deliberation , and after referring the subject for the judicial consideration of his majesty 's attorney and solicitor general , and receiving the elaborate report of those learned gentlemen upon the subject , decided that the duke of Atholl had no right to the claims he preferred . The noble duke claimed , under the appointment of James I. a power which , he thanked God , no king of this country ever enjoyed , a power of taxing the people at his mere will . This power the house of Keys , in the Isle of Man , who are the proper representatives of the inhabitants , denied ; and this was the question now at issue . It was somewhat extraordinary that though those claims had been rejected , after four years deliberation , by the privy council , when a noble lord , now in another house ( lord Sidmouth ) , was at the head of administrationâ€”an administration which he had supported , which he should
