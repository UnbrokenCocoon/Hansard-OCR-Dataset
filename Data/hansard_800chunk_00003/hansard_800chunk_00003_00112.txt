possession at those two periods.—The second description of troops which should be deducted from the gross amount of the encrease of forces abroad , consists of an addition of about 1,300 men to the fencible and local corps in Nova Scotia , the Bermudas , New Brunswick , and other settlements which are not at all in the view of the enemy : and these two numbers , of 1,639 and 1,300 , being deducted from 14,868 , reduces to 11,900 the amount of those reinforcements , which can be considered as influencing the real strength and security of our foreign possessions , or as being applicable to counteract the enemy 's projects against them.—There is still , however , a third class of these reinforcements , which , as I have before mentioned , are placed in a situation where , in my opinion , they , for the present at least , will have no influence on the operations of the war , either offensively or defensively : I mean the expedition under sir James Craig , This I probably do not overrate , in stating it at between four and five thousand men ; a more injudicious , or a more unfortunate disposition of which force could not possibly have been made under the present circumstances . It was not wanted for defensive purposes in that quarter ; it is too small for offensive ones of any importance ; and if , as I have heard it conjectured , the taking of Minorca with a view to facilitating the blockade . of Toulon was the object , to carry that intention into effect now , would , with a view to the present state of the war , be rather out of season ; it would be shutting the stable door after the horse was out . What other offensive operation of any importance such a force as this can undertake there , I can not guess ; what purposes of defence they can be 664 applied to , which can make the posts which we occupy in the Mediterranean more secure than they were last year , I know not : and that they are totally out of the way of coming to the aid of those other foreign possessions that are menaced by the powerful armaments which have lately been sent abroad by the enemy , every one must admit . Therefore , in drawing this sort of general comparison between the different degrees of danger or security of our foreign possessions at the present moment , and at the period immediately preceding the right hon . gent 's return to office , ( when he voted for a motion similar to mine ) it is fair to deduct these 4,500 men , employed under Sir James Craig , from the amount of those reinforcements that are to be brought into account against the detachments made by the enemy ; which would reduce the former to something less than 7,500 , whilst the latter , as I have before stared , mat , on a moderate computation , be reckoned at 13,000.—but this is not all : —It is not merely in this point of view that we are to consider the increase of danger abroad . It is not merely that we have only an increase of 7,500 to set off against the enemy 's increase of 13,000 ; but the question again occurs , where are ours , . and where are his ? —Ours are scattered throughout the vast extent of our East and West India possessions , whilst his are for the most part united , and , if gone to the West Indies , will not find the most valuable of our islands capable of resisting are attack of so large a force.—Under all these circumstances and considering the subject in every point of view , the must conclude that our affairs abroad are in a much worse state than they were last year , when the right hon . gent . thought the situation of the country such as to make it necessary for parliament to enquire into the
