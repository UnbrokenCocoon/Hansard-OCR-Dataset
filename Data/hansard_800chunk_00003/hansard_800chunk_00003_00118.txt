clear , that as a general principle it is at all times desirable that the establishment provided by parliament should not greatly exceed the effective strength of the army : and with particular reference to the present time , to the actual state of this country and of Europe , and the nature of the contest in which we find ourselves engaged . it must be admitted to be in the highest degree expedient and necessary , that the effective strength of the army should be nearly equal to the numbers that were this year voted . It is therefore incumbent on his majesty 's ministers to shew us the means by which they expect to make good the deficiency ; or rather I should say that , seeing the enormous amount of this deficiency , and the experienced inefficacy of all the measures which his majesty 's ministers have adopted for making it good , it is become the duty of parliament to investigate a subject of such importance . What the deficiency is , and what the progress made by the present administration towards the completion of the army , will appear from the statements contained in the subsequent resolutions : which statements are accurately extracted from the official returns now in possession of the members of this house . The second resolution that I have to propose therefore is , 'That from the returns lately presented to this house , it appears that on the 1st of the present month , there was a deficiency of 672 45,134 men in his majesty 's regular British cavalry and infanry , and of 4,212 in the foreign cores ; amounting together to 49,346 men wanting to complete the regular army . '—In the next resolution , which contains a statement of the progress that we are making towards the completion of the army , I have confined my view to that part of it only which consists of British troops ; because the recruiting of the foreign corps is so uncertain , that it is impossible from an average of the last 12 or 18 months , to judge of what may happen in the ensuing . the third resolution , therefore , is , That , from the returns presented to this house of the effective strength of his majesty 's forces , on the 1st of January , 1804 , and the 1st of June , 1805 , it appears that , at the former period , the total amount of regular British cavalry and infantry was 122,700 men ( including 1,000 recruits at the army depot who were omitted in the said returns ) and at the latter period 137,345 , being an increase of 14,645 men ; but that this was in part occasioned by he enlistment of 8,963 men from the militia , —so that the actual increase arising from any means that can be considered as permanent , was not more than 5,682 men in 17 months , which is at the rate of about 4,000 men per annum , being something less than one-eleventh part of the present deficiency . ' But if we go a little further into detail , we shall find , that of this small encrease of the army which has been effected in the last 17 months , a very small proportion only has taken place in that part of it which is of the greatest importance . The infantry constitutes the main force of every army ; it is that to which every military man , in enquiring into the strength of an army , first directs his attention ; it is that which is necessary upon all occasions . But if this is the case with respect to , armies in general , it is still more strongly so with respect to ours in particular , on account of the great number of our foreign possessions , in which infantry alone is employed . It is therefore interesting to consider this branch of our military force separately ; and with that view I have drawn up time following resolutions , namely , 'That on the
