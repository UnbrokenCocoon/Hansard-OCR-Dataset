altogether one of my own invention ; for I happen to know from perfectly good authority that a similar project was entertained in the American war , and was actually proposed , as one that he was desirous of acting upon , by a French officer of reputation , then in a high responsible situation , I mean the marquis de Bouillé . I have good reason . to state possitively , that previous to admiral Rodney 's falling in with count de Grasse 's fleet , the marquis de Bouillé proposed to the admiral to depart suddenly from the West Indies , to return straight to Europe , and to enter the channel ( which they would then have commanded for a time , as they did at another period of the war ) for the purpose 669 of bringing over to England the army which was assembled on the coast of Normandy . This project , I am fully persuaded , was seriously entertained ; and if it was then thought practicable by an officer of repute , as M. de Bouillé was , why should a similar idea be treated as too extravagant for serious consideration , now that the enemy possesses means , such as France never before possessed , of taking advantage of a temporary superiority in the narrow seas ? —for again I say , let it be recollected that the anchorage of the Downs and the Streights being for a very few days only in possession of the enemy , would suffice to enable their flotillas to effect the disembarkation of an immense army on our coasts . But its whatever degree this idea may or may not be thought deserving attention , yet I think that the general reasoning must he admitted to be just , by which I have attempted to shew that . the operations that are now going on abroad are by no means inconsistent with a perseverance in the ulterior designs of invasion which the enemy has hitherto been supposed to entertain , and that distant operations of this sort and magnitude , exclusive of the mischief which may immediately result from them to our colonies , commerce , and finances , may be considered as having a direct tendency to facilitate that ultimate enterprize , by the certainty of greatly weakening the regular part of our home defensive army , and by the probable chance of leading our fleets astray . At all events , I shall presently prove beyond all possibility of dispute , that since the present chancellor of the exchequer came into office , the enemy 's means of attacking us in Europe , as well as out of it , have been added to in a tench greater proportion than our means of defence . For , setting aside the idea of the sudden return of the squadrons which they have since sent to the West Indies , yet the accession of that part of the Spanish navy now in Europe which is capable of going to sea , is more than equal to double the number of French ships now abroad ; so that ( exclusive of the addition that may have been made to the French and Dutch fleets and flotillas in another year of preparation ) the combined fleets at this moment fit for sea in Europe , are actually 14. or 15 sail of the line more numerous than they were last year ; whilst we , to supply the place of the large squadrons that we have since that time detached to the West Indies , & c , have only added one to the number of ships in commission above the rate of frigates.—Let us now enquire whether the exertions that have been made to strengthen our land forces at 670 home , have been such as to counterbalance this disadvantage . In comparing the official returns which have been presented to the house at different periods , I find , that on the rut of January , 1804 , the gross amount of cavalry and infantry of all descriptions , including militia , was 220,418 ,
