to preside at the admiralty , I shall the nation , as the builders have raised be most ready to meet him ; but at present I can not be so irregular as to enter upon the subject , more especially as there are no materials before your lordships from which you might he enabled to form a judgment.—The noble lord has now , as well as before , said , that , his object is to examine into the comparative state of the navy at the time it was under the management and control of the board of admiralty at which the noble earl presided , and the board of admiralty at which I had the honour to preside . Upon that subject the noble lord will not , I trust , say , that I have shewn any backwardness to meet him.—I am perfectly ready to admit that there is a greater appearance of activity in the fleets of our enemies than there was twelve months ago ; consequently it may be supposed that their naval force is now in a more efficient state than it has been since the commencement of the present war , or than it was even during some years towards the conclusion of the last war . If this be the fact , and of which I have but little doubt , it evidently shews that no relaxation whatever should have taken place in regard to the exertions necessary for preserving the naval superiority and pre-eminence of Great Britain ; and this can only be maintained by having at all times such a number of ships in complete repair and good condition as may be capable of meeting the fleets of our enemies , let their numbers be what they may . It is on this ground my opinion has been formed , that if this object can not be accomplished by 93 the exertions of the king 's yards solely , recourse must necessarily be had to the merchants ' yards for that purpose.—There are various modes of conducting the operations of our fleets , with a view to ensure safety at home , protection to our trade , and security to our colonies and foreign possessions.—With respect to the system of blockade , experience has shewn that too much dependence ought not to be placed on it , however persevering and vigilant our officers may be ; besides the great wear and tear which it causes in our ships is matter for serious consideration . Yet I am nevertheless decidedly of opinion , that at certain times the blockading of the ports of the enemy may be not only highly politic but necessary , and may also essentially conduce to the interest and the security of the country . To blockade the enemy 's ports at the beginning of a war , and when our resources may require some time to be brought forward , is highly proper . In every war , the security of the mother country is the first consideration . Every thing else must , in the nature of things , be considered as secondary objects . At the beginning of a war it may frequently happen that this country is not exactly in such a state of defence us might be wished , to repel any sudden or serious danger . In this country too , however great our resources may be , it generally happens that they are not put very rapidly in motion ; consequently it is necessary , until measures are taken for the security of the country , to blockade the enemy 's ports as closely as the nature of the service and circumstances will admit . But when the country is placed in a respectable state of defence , and when nothing serious is to be apprehended for our security at home , then I do contend , that it is extremely unwise to confine ourselves to a blockade only , instead of turning our attention and our efforts to other operations . I consider it to be unwise , because we find it to be impossible to do it with
