, he was obliged , if not actually to turn seamen out of their usual 206 sleeping places , at least to make it very inconvenient to them , and to deprive them of those comforts to which our gallant tars were so well entitled . Capt . Dunn has acknowledged that he ordered the spirit-room to be cleared out and the spirits belonging to his majesty to be stowed in the hold , for the purpose of stowing the admiral 's wines and spirits in the public spirit-room , in direct violation of the naval printed instructions , which state particularly the manner in which the spirit-room is to be fitted up , and the wine and spirits are to be taken care of by the purser , who ( say the instructions ) is never to expect any allowance for leakage of wine or spirits , but to see that the casks be sound and full at their coming on board , and to be answerable for the care of them afterwards , there being proper conveniences made in the hold for securing them from abuses , which are not to be employed to any other use whatsoever.—Had captain Wood commanded the Acasta , not a log of mahogany nor any of those various articles enumerated , and acknowledged to have been loaded on board , could have been introduced on board his majesty 's ship , without subjecting himself to the penalties of the 18th article of war . Captain Dunn , by his friendly complaisance to his admiral 's wishes , is now placed in that unfortunate situation , liable to be tried by a court martial , and dismissed the service.—Notwithstanding admiral Duckworth 's oppressive and unjust conduct was most clearly proved before the court martial , and indeed admitted by the lords of the admiralty themselves , by their having immediately re-appointed capt . Wood to the command of the Acasta ; notwithstanding it was clearly proved by captain Dunn , that the spirit-room , in direct violation of the naval instructions , ( pages 120 and 203 , ) was cleared out to make way for the admiral 's liquors ; notwithstanding it was admitted by the admiral himself , that he had on board 11 logs and 2 slabs of mahogany , several wardrobes , 200 guineas worth of Spanish snuff , 20 casks of wine and spirits , and 30 or 40 casks of fruit , with various other articles . A naval court martial has not merely acquitted him , but most fully and most honourably acquitted him , of every part of the charge ; navy , not satisfied with his acquittal , they have declared the charges gross , unfounded , malicious and scandalous . So illegal and so unjust a sentence , I will venture to assert , upon the 207 never was pronounced by any court martial.—Thus , sir , has not only an act of parliament , formed for the express purpose of restricting naval officers from converting his majesty 's ships of war to the private emolument of individuals , been not merely set at defiance , but by the sanction of a court martial the door has been thrown open to abuses , which if not speedily remedied , must end in the ruin of the discipline and good government of the naval service of this country.—When even the laws of the country may not have provided any direct and easy road for the protection of individuals from gross and premeditated violence and injustice , but more particularly when those acts of injustice and oppression have been committed against a servant of the public , employed on the public service . I humbly conceive , sir , it is the bounden duty of this house , not merely to enquire , but to sift such matters to the bottom , that they may support , without affection or favour , that high character to which I trust the country will ever look up with confidence.—In the present instance , sir , it is not merely acts of gross violence and injustice that is
