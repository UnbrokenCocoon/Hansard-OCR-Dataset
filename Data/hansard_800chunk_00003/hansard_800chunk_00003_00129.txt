which more immediately relates to the regular army itself : and I feel confident , that if the army was reinstated in the exclusive possession of all those advantages , honours , and distinctions that peculiarly belong to the military profession , if the defects of its own internal constitution were remedied , if the conditions which may he supposed to render men averse from entering into in were changed , and if the competition now raised against it by other branches of the public force were completely abolished and done away , —I feel confident , I say , that under these circumstances , we should not find it difficult to procure an army adequate to the exigencies of the state.—In the changes and improvements which I have to suggest in the internal constitution of the army , I can add little to what appears to have been urged by my right hon . friend ( Mr. Windham ) in the speech with which he introduced a motion which he made at the commencement of the session , when I was not here . I perfectly agree with him , and I have always thought that the first thing to be done , with a view . to removing one of the principal obstacles to the recruiting it , would be the enlistment for a term of years instead of for life . The advantage and propriety of this change , which has been so often recommended , particularly by my right hon . friend , seemed last year to be recognized and admitted by so large a proportion of the house , that his majesty 's ministers found it necessary to assure the house that they would take it into their most serious consideration . They afterwards stated that they had done so ; but that they had found so many objections started by high military authorities , as to induce them to give it up.—I can not however say , that they have treated the house wth great respect ; for they have never told us who those high military authorities were , nor what were the reasons which they assigned in support of their opinion . For my own part , I do not consider this as a question upon which the house ought blindly to defer to any military authority whatsoever , because I do not consider it as a purely military question : nay , there are some points of view in which I think that the gentlemen composing this house , from the very circumstance of their nal being military men , are fitter 687 judges than those who have passed all their lives in the army , and who , therefore , have less opportunity of observing and becoming familiar with the feelings and prejudices of the people and peasantry of this country . The question of the policy of this change , with a view to facilitating the keeping up of the army , divides itself into two branches ; first , the consideration of the proportion in which it is probable that the number of recruits would be encreased by lessening the dislike that men now have to entering into the service ; and secondly , the probable loss that the army would annually sustain in consequence of the discharge of men whose term of service had expired . With respect to the latter , it happens , fortunately for the investigation of the subject , that there has long existed a considerable body of English troops , I mean the East India company 's European troops , in which the soldiers have been enlisted for a term of years much shorter than any that has ever been proposed for the king 's army , and in which ; both from the shortness of the term , namely , 5 years , as well as from their being constantly stationed abroad , all the principal inconveniencies that seem to deter government from adopting the proposed change , must have been felt in full force . Thus we have an easy and sure means of trying this part of the subject
