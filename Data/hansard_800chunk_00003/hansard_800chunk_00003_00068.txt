many other frigates that required coming home to England , in which the vice-admiral might have been accommodated . Had admiral Duckworth returned in the Acasta under the command of that captain to whom the lords of the admiralty had thought proper to intrust the command of her , not only the common usage of the service , but that attention which every officer is bound to pay to the common calls of justice and of humanity would have been preserved , but this would not have suited nor have answered the admiral 's purposes.—The Acasta was a large roomy frigate , and the admiral had a number of things to bring home , which he durst not ask any captain , a stranger , to permit to be loaded on board , and which no one but a confidential friend would have suffered to pass unnoticed . There was also a large freight of treasure to be brought home from Jamaica , 7-eighths of the commission on which captain Wood was entitled to ; the other eighth to the admiral . Admiral Duckworth therefore not only determined to return to England in the Acasta , but to deprive captain Wood of the command of her , for the purpose of conferring it upon captain Dunn , the admiral 's captain and confidential friend ; and for this purpose the vice-admiral appoints capt . Wood to the Hercule , a 74-gun ship , at that time at sea , and assigns as his reason , the giving him a ship of greater consequence . This reason captain Wood knew to be false and groundless , and , as I shall shew hereafter , the vice-admiral himself acknowledged to be so . Independent of this confession of the vice-admiral , admiral Dacres ( his successor in the command ) bad informed captain Wood officially that he had determined to hoist his flag on board of the Hercule the instant she returned to port , which he accordingly did , and which the vice-admiral knew he would do , before the Acasta arrived at Jamaica.—In this manner , sir , was capt . Wood dispossessed of the command of his ship , the distress and mortification resulting therefrom had nearly deprived him of his reason , and labouring under this affliction without a friend on whom he could confide , or with whom he could advise , for the vice-admiral had shifted all the officers ; 170 of the ship 's com- 204 pany , as well as the captain of the Acasta , is it to be wondered at , that the vice-admiral should have had the advantage of him at his trial , whose honest sensibility had to contend with power and systematic arrangements , supported by prejudice and partiality , nay even perjury ? —Exclusive of losing his ship , admiral Duckworth deprived him of at least 2000l . commission , to which he was entitled as commander of the Acasta , as much as to his pay , either given to captain Dunn , or arranged in whatever other manner the admiral chose to dispose of it.—To reconcile to the common feelings of mankind , much more to justify so strong a measure , common prudence required that the motives of the vice-admiral himself should have been perfectly pure and disinterested , but it can be proved , that so far from having been actuated by any disinterested and honourable motive , that at tins very time he must have had in contemplation the violation of an act of parliament for which the removal of captain Wood from the ship was absolutely necessary.—In the first place , let me call the attention of the house to the defence which the vice-admiral offers for superseding an officer commanding one of his majesty 's ships under a commission from the lords commissioners of the admiralty , to give her to a protégé of his own ; viz . `` that he could not commit the honour of his flag , and his own character to the chapter of accidents , nor cross the Atlantic in a ship commanded by a
