our preventing these arrivals of treasure from America ; or any so great probability of it as to amount , in point of expediency , to a justifiable cause of war . idly , Are these supplies so necessary to our enemies in the present war , that without them Spain can do nothing , and the exertions of France will be very materially lessened ? Why , sir , as to the question whether we can prevent , during war , the remittances of bullion from America to Spain , I shall not enter into a train of vague conjecture ; but if were to judge from what is passing every day , I must think that , whilst the enemy 's fleets or squadrons , whether of twenty ships of the line or of two , appear to go in and out of port , to and from the West Indies , in short , very nearly where they please , there seems to be no such very great probability that the squadrons bringing home treasure should be so frequently intercepted ; at least I am at a loss to know how we can calculate upon it with such a degree of confidence as to justify 657 our grounding the policy of a war with Spain upon that probability . And as to the second question , namely , whether the intercepting this treasure , if we are fortunate enough to do so , will materially cripple the exertions of France and anninilate these of Spain , I should also say , that what has happened since our disgraceful seizure of the treasure ships by surprise does not justify any such opinion . As yet I think we have no proof that the powers of the French government to put its navy into a state of activity have been paralyzed by this pecuniary disappointment ; and with respect to Spain , there certainly appears to have been a considerable degree of activity on her part , in equipping her squadrons for sea . Indeed the supposition on which his majesty 's ministers have acted , that the emperor of the French , though possessing the whole resources of France , Flanders , Holland , part of Germany , and , we may almost say , the whole of Italy , should be prevented by the occasional capture of the Spanish galleons , from prosecuting the war with vigour , appears to me , I confess , to be a most egregious absurdity , and I do not think that any rational man would be convinced of its being otherwise , by any of the pamphlets or writings of those ingenious gentlemen who have amused their readers with similar predictions ever since the commencement of the war that followed the French revolution . But , unless their present predictions should prove to be better founded than the former , they must admit , that whatever exertions Spin shall make must be considered as an actual and positive encrease of the aggregate sum of the real efficient powers of the enemy against whom we have to contend . The French government , indeed , which is perhaps as well able to judge of the sufficiency and probable duration of its own pecuniary resources as even our present ministers themselves , does not appear to be regulated in its conduct by any such estimate of its means , as that which forms the only ground of policy on which his majesty 's ministers have plunged us into the war with Spain . For the very circumstance , that the Spaniards are actually fitting out their navy , does , in my opinion , amount to a proof that the government of France foresees no impediment ( arising from want of money ) to continuing its own exertions in the naval department on as large a scale as was before intended . For they well know that , the number of ships being equal , a naval force , composed entirely of French , must be far more efficient for their purposes than a combined one of 658 French and Spanish :
