, or only from year to year . He thought that on sound principles of revenue they ought to be permanent , in order to give to the public credit better security than could attend the passing of them to the public use from year to year . He believed that his right hon . friend would be able to satisfy the jealousy of the House , that there was nothing in the bill to affect the interest of the Crown unfavourably , at least nothing that could not be altered to the satisfaction of the House in a Committee . wished to know whether there was in this bill , any specific provision to shew that the hereditary revenues of the Crown shall revert to the Crown , when that period should occur when there , was a demise of the Crown , for if there was no such provision in tin 's bill , he doubted very much , whether the bill should have come into the House at all ; and he was sure that if not , the House ought not to go into a Committee upon it , at least until a message came to the House , from the Crown , desiring them to proceed upon such a measure . As to the malt duty in Ireland , which was still an annual vote , he did not know the amount of it so as to be able to judge of the check which Parliament retained in that respect upon the executive government , by way of power to withhold the supplies from year to year . If the right hon . gent , could satisfy the House upon these two points he should be glad to hear him . said , that accounts had been kept of the hereditary revenues distinct from the others , and he was informed that the law officers in Ireland prepared a clause for 818 the purpose of saving the rights of the Crown from every thing except the operation of the agreement between the Crown and the Parliament of Ireland , in the 33d of the Crown . Whether the mode which had been adopted for that purpose was such , wa3 not for him to state ; he knew that that principle had always been preserved , and had understood that the provisions were adequate for that purpose . That provision had always been inserted in every revenue bill since the agreement had been entered into between the Crown and the Parliament of Ireland , and he took it for granted that every thing would be adopted by the House that was necessary for perfect clearness . This bill was clearly of the form of former bills , which contained a provision for saving the rights of the Crown . Here he read the provision out of the Statute Book in a former Act of Parliament . Mr. Foster asked if that provision was in the present bill ? Mr. Corry said , he had no doubt of it : the House would consider how it was prepared . He had no doubt it was correct , though he had not had an opportunity of reading it ; it was sent to him in the usual manner after it was drawn up by the law officers of the Crown . As to the amount of the duties proposed to be voted permanently , and those which were to be annual , the annual was above one-tenth of the whole . said , that the first question now , was not whether there was such a clause as that which was alluded to by the right hon . gent . but whether in fact , the House could do any thing further without further explanation , or whether indeed the right hon . gent , ought not to have beta ready with his explanation before he came forward with his bill ? The next question was , if there was not such a clause , what the House should allow to be done upon such a gross violation of form , and such a substantial objection in
