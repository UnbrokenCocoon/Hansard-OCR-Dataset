possesses , and when they compare ( hem with any means of annoyance which the enemy can command , although it can never induce them to trust the protection of the country exclusively to that description of force , which must depend in some degree upon an uncertain element for its means of acting , yet they must feel that they have every thing to hope , as the enemy have every thing to dread , from the exertions of our navy.—It would be injustice not to notice , with the praise that belongs to it , the distinguished share which the ordnance department has borne in the execution of the present armament . In the habits of providing for a military system upon a scale altogether dissimilar to that upon which the wisdom of Parliament has thought it expedient at present to act , the ordnance has been prepared to meet , almost at the outset of the war , the unparalleled demands that have been made upon it . Since the commencement of hostilities , there have been issued by the ordnance 312,000 muskets , 16,000 pistols , and 77,000 pikes , reserving in store such an amount of arms , as , in the event of a campaign , may be sufficient to meet the waste on service of so extended an army , whilst measures have been taken , which will enable it , at no distant period , completely to arm the whole of the volunteers.—The field train , which was fully adequate in the last war to the force then employed , is , in Great-Britain alone , already increased from 346 to 648 pieces of ordnance , completely appointed , and brigaded under experienced officers . The horses attached to the same have been increased from 3,300 to 5,900 , and the drivers from 1,400 to 3,000 . The quantity of moveable ammunition with each gun has also been nearly doubled . The made-up ammunition for small arms , both distributed and in store , has been increased even in a greater degree , and the general provision of stores in all the other branches is equally abundant . Corresponding exertions have been made for the 208 service of Ireland.—I have thus detailed to the Committee the actual state of defence , in which the country has been placed , during the first seven months of the war . Looking to the aggregate , in army , navy , and ordnance , I venture to put it to the feelings of the Committee , whether his Majesty 's ministers have slept upon their post or failed in their duty to the public . I am not disposed to contrast what has been done with the result of any former exertions made in any former war , for I am perfectly ready to admit that the exigency is as unexampled as the facilities of every description which the government has experienced from the nation ; but I am desirous of putting it fairly to the Committee ( admitting the extent of our resources , and the disposition to place them at the disposal of government , which perhaps never existed in an equal degree at any former period ) whether they have not been called forth with diligence , with rapidity , and with effect . I may , without presumption , speak with the less reserve upon this subject , as the department entrusted to my care , although it subjects me to an equal share of responsibility with the rest of my colleagues , entitles me certainly to no participation in the praise which belongs to the successful execution of these measures . I have therefore felt myself called upon , in justice towards the persons who preside , at this important crisis , ' over the great military departments of the King 's government , to state what I have done , and thereby to discharge a debt of gratitude , which I owe to them , in common with the country.—Having said thus much on the past military system and measures of the King 's government , I should not
