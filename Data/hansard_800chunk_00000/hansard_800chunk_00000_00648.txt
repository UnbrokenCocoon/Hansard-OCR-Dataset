in : and the objection on the part of himself and others who thought with him on this occasion , was , that the improvement to be obtained was in many of its parts doubtful , that it was not applicable to much of that for which it professed to be intended , and that it was at all events not worth the price that must be paid for it : for that independent of other considerations , though the bill might in the end do something for bettering the volunteers , it would in the mean while operate most injuriously on every other species of force , and finally deprive us of that species which was confessedly the most valuable , lie meant a regular army . This was the view to be taken of the question , and these the several points of comparison , by the result of which the question must be determined.—To assist the judgment of the House in forming that comparison , it would be right to consider some of the general reasonings on which all the measures adopted for some time past seemed to have been founded.—These would for the most part , be reducible to the three or four following propositions : 1st , that the prospect of an immediate attack from the enemy , though not absolutely certain , was so nearly so , that persons must act precisely as if its certainty was assured to them , 2dly , that this danger , thus certain and immediate , was of a nature so disproportionate to every other , that nothing could be allowed to come in competition with it , or could be regarded for the time otherwise than as it could be made consistent with that great 974 and over-ruling object , 3dly , That the improvement of the volunteers was , in the actual state of things , the means most effectual that could be taken for guarding against this danger , and , consequently , must be pursued , even supposing ( what was not admitted ) that it was injurious in many other respects , and was inconsistent with those provisions and establishments which would be most conducive to the safety of the country in future . These propositions , every one of which ought to be true , to support the measures which had been built upon them , were nevertheless , he would venture to say , every one of them false . To the . first , which said that such was the probability of an immediate attack , that our conduct must be the same as if the event were certain , the answer was , that our language and our actions were wholly at variance with each other , and that nothing could be more , evident , than , that while we talked this language , we ourselves had no belief in the truth of it ; for that , if we had , it was impossible to suppose that we should content ourselves with such precautions merely as those which we were taking . It was in vain , therefore , to attempt to rest any measure upon the ground that we were to consider the present danger , otherwise than as one which , though probable in a high degree , might nevertheless not happen.—The other proposition , that , namely , which related to the magnitude of the danger , which would confine the whole of our thoughts and exertions to the business of present defence , and would allow of no competition between that and any other object , was a question of somewhat greater extent , and required a more particular examination . It was always forgot or dissembled in talking upon this subject , that cases of present danger were to be distinguished into two sorts , viz . those in which the danger being present , was present merely , and , if it should happily be escaped , would be succeeded by a state of ordinary security and those in which the danger , though present , was Only the commencement of
