volunteers , and then to ride about the country ; and with this book in his hand let him consider how it would be possible for troops to perform those manœuvres in the enclosures which cover almost the whole surface of this kingdom.—Sir , when I I mention the name of general Dundas , I hope I shall not be represented as speaking slightingly of that valuable officer , as I formerly have been said to do of the Commander in Chief , although I certainly never did any such thing . I have the highest respect for general Dundas 's abilities , and I knew that he has rendered the most useful services . But I never can or will allow myself , as a member of Parliament , to be deterred by any consi- 591 deration from delivering my opinions. , when I think there is any opportunity of giving one that can be useful ; and I do maintain that what is called general Dundas 's System , as now practised by the volunteers , is the very worst that could be adopted for them , and perfecly unsuited to the nature of our country . The agricultural improvements which have been so extensively encouraged all over the kingdom , the hedges and ditches with which almost every part of it is intersected , render the application of such a system absolutely impracticable.—The volunteers , however , must naturally form their ideas of war from what they are taught to practise as a preparation for war : moving , as they always do , in solid battalions , they naturally expect that when they come to fight , they will meet an enemy formed in the same manner in solid battalions like their own ; and they have probably determined to charge him at once . But they will see no such thing . They will feel the enemy rather tli3n see him . They will discover his line only by the fire that issues from it ; and whilst they , in a compact body , are presenting a great mass to him which he can not miss , he will be spread behind banks , hedges , trees , See , taking advantage of every little circumstance of the ground in such a manner that they will scarcely see any thing to strike at ; and they will be wholly at a loss how to act.—It is natural , that when men go into action for the first time , they should be in some degree embarrassed ; but what must that embarrassment be , if they find ( as will be the case with the volunteers ) , that every thing is so perfectly unlike what they have practised and been taught to expect ? —I well recollect how much I was surprized , when I first saw the French , at not being able to discover those solid battalions to which my eye was accustomed , having then had no experience in war , excepting on the plains of India . I afterwards , in Ireland , had an opportunity of observing , in a trifling instance , the effect of teaching men a system not suited to the country ; for , upon my ordering an officer of militia to occupy an enclosure , he drew up his men in a solid body in the middle of the field , as he h3d always done on the parade , instead of lining the fence ; and however absurd such a mistake may appear , it is not much to be wondered at that men should do what you have taught them.—I repeat it then , that , in my opinion , the present system of training is in every point of view extremely injudicious . It is attended with much unnecessary constraint ; it takes up too much of their time ; and it is wholly unsuited to tits country and 592 species of warfare in which they will be engaged : whereas , what I recommend is easy , natural , and is just what they will have to do when
