his idea of the meaning of the act . If a petition were presented , not by the real freeholders of Middlesex , but by a tumultuous crowd assembled at the door of that House , assuming the name of freeholders ; even if an outrage of this audacious nature were practised , his would affirm , that , in the first instance , the petition must be received and sent to a Committee . The paper , such as it . was , purported to be the petition of Middlesex freeholders , and the House had no authority to take cognizance of the fraud in the first instance . It was with the Committee to ascertain and to punish such an attempt to impose on the legislature , liven admitting that the present petition were signed by Sarah or Jodah , instead of William and Thomas , Mill it must go to the Committee , and with them rested the ultimate decision . The petition contained allegation ? , and till his Committee had determined on its merits , the House had no right to presume that they were false . With the fact the louse could have DO interference . The law requited that every petition should contain certain allegations , and the question was , whether those who signed the petition had complied with its requisitions . Had they claimed their right to vote 392 at the last election ? If they had , then the argument was at an end . If they had not , then the question was equally resolved , unless the House were disposed to decide in the face of a positive law . The petitioners might be very respectable individuals , as he had no doubt they were , and it might appear , on examination , that their right to vote was undoubted ; all this might be safely admitted , and still the question would stand precisely where it did before the matter was agitated.â€”The only point was to consider how far the petition was drawn in such terms as could bring the consideration of its merits under the provisions of the Grenville Act . There might be a great appearance of equity in the case , but still the law must be permitted to have its force . If cases of equity were to supersede statutes , the beneficial effects of which were universally admitted , legislative provisions were a mere nullity . The honourable gentleman here noticed the petition which he had himself presented on the subject of the conduct of the high bailiff of Westminster , in the famous contested election of 1784 . He believed , that there never was a case laid down in any petition of more obvious and striking equity than that petition contained . The majority of the House were convinced of this , even while they resisted the admission of the petition . They rested their opposition solely on the ground of the allegations which it contained , not being such as the Grenville Act had specified to be necessary , previous to the introduction of any petition . So sensible were the House of the necessity of rigidly adhering to the previsions of the act , that a petition confessed to be equitable in itself was rejected , and a short time afterwards a new act was introduced , to remedy an admitted inconvenience . As the law now stood , the matter was reduced to the simplest principles . Whatever was the matter of the petition , the House were to leave it wholly to the Committee . They were not to deliberate or decide . They were to admit or reject a petition , not because the admission or rejection was wise , or the contrary , not because it was or was not founded in equity , but because the provisions of the act Were peremptorily mandatory , and were not under any circumstances to be disobeyed . The legislature was now strictly bound to the observance of a particular mode of proceeding , and it was quite absurd to think of getting rid of it
