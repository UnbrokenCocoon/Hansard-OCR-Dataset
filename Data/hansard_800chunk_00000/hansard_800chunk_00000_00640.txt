disposed to lend a very favourable ear to those who presume ( like myself ) to tell them that they have been , proceeding upon principles altogether erroneous , and that the whole work , therefore , requires a complete and fundamental revision.—Sir , I too , am as desirous as any man can pos- 962 sibly be , that our military system should be established on a permanent basis ; for until this is done , we can never enjoy that tranquillity arising from a consciousness of our strength , without which we must gradually lose our consideration and influence amongst the nations of Europe , and must , upon every recurring emergency , be again exposed to that fluctuation of councils , and that sort of feverish uneasiness which we have lately experienced ; But in proportion as I am anxious to see our military system placed upon a permanent footing , just in the same proportion must I be anxious to see the present one undergo a complete alteration ; for in every branch of it I rind much to censure in what has been done , and much-to regret in what has been omitted.—With respect to our regular army , that force , without which we can never tie either respected by our friends , or dreaded by our enemies , or secure at home ; that , which ought to be the first and greatest object of our solicitude , but which evidently is the last at least ; with respect to our regular army , I say , the measures which are now pursuing render it every day more and more impossible that it should be recruited for we are every day holding , out additional inducements , and offering men new bounties not to enlist into it . In the militia , for instance , a man gets 15 guineas bounty for 5 years service ; arid if he has a wife and family , they are provided for during his absence from home : in the army of reserve he gets a bounty of from 35 to 50 guineas for 5 years service within the realm , with a similar provision for his wife and children : in the volunteer corps , exclusive of other advantages , he has also that of having his wife and children taken care of by the parish , if he is called out of it : and under all these circumstances you expect , that for a bounty of 8 or 10 guineas a man will enlist in the regular army , binding himself for life to serve in whatever party of the world it may be his fate ' to be sent to , and leaving his wife and children to starve ; for the provision which is made for the families of men in other branches of the public force , is withheld from those of the regular soldier . Under these circumstances , I say it is impossible that we should have an army ; nor can we expect to have one , until those measures are adopted which have been so often recommended by my right hon . friend below me , ( Mr. Windham ) . I shall not tire the 963 House by repeating what he has urged with so much more force ; but to the opinions which he has so frequently expressed upon this subject of the army , I do most entirely subscribe . With respect to the militia , I certainly think that it was extremely unwise to extend , so far beyond its ancient limits , a force , to which there is this objection at least ( and I think there are many others ) , that it is not applicable to the general defence of the empire . And then , Sir , as to this part of the public force which is now more immediately under consideration , what is called the volunteer system , I really think , that from beginning to end , it affords the most manifest proofs of the extremely injudicious manner in which his Majesty 's .
