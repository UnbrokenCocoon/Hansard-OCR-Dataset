, dictated by slavish power and inordinate ambition , it behoves us to consult our immediate security , and not to allow of even the idea of disbanding so large a body as 400,000 men , however imperfectly constructed they may be . We should rather examine how far this force may . be rendered effective ; and , with this view , I shall state to the House the mode that , in my judgment , ought to be pursued . How far ministers have failed , heretofore , in the performance of their duty with respect to the volunteers ; how far they have wished to carry into complete execution the system of which they appear to approve , I will not now stop to inquire , farther than to say , that they should have been more attentive to promote the regulation of the several volunteer corps . They should have communicated more precise instructions through the medium of the lords-lieutenants of counties , as to the best method of training the volunteers , of procuring a regular attendance at drills , and enforcing attention to discipline when there . These are points of arrangement very material to consider , and ministers should even now , and I hope it is not too late , look to objects of so much consequence . I do not mean that any superfluous directions should be given to the volunteers , nor do I ask to have them trained up in the way in which the advocates of an armed peasantry would recommend , who seem to imagine that such peasantry could be converted into that quality of force , namely , light troops , for which , of all others , they are least qualified . But , I would have the volunteers instructed in all the necessary evolutions , and this I am decidedly of opi- 546 nion , would be far the best course to pursue , particularly as it must be admitted , that , under existing circumstances , it would be quite absurd , if not dangerous , to think of proposing a new system to supercede that of the volunteers . To promote this improvement in the discipline of the volunteers , is a thing so obviously necessary , and so highly desirable , that I should hope no minor difficulties will be allowed to stand in the way , that no mistaken or narrow notions of economy will operate to impede such an important object , but that the volunteer force will be rendered as perfect in military discipline , as the nature of the institution , the peculiar character of its members , and the proximity of our dangers will admit . What I speak of the dangers of the country , I do not mean it to be understood although I think the system of our defence has made a progress far short of what it might and ought to have done , that even with our volunteer force , so imperfectly instructed as they are , with our other resources , I should feel any dread for the result of meeting the most formidable attack the enemy can possibly contrive to make ; but yet I feel that the House will not have performed its duty if , after the solemn warning it has received from ministers themselves , of the near approach of the enemy , any thing that can be done shall by any possibility be neglected ; that any contrivance shall be overlooked which can at all enable us to contend , I will say collectively and individually , with the powerful and inveterate enemy that disturbs us , and to contend with such effect as not only to accomplish his final discomfiture , but to convince him and his infatuated adherents , that any attempt to invade and subjugate England can only originate in the wildest ambition , and must terminate in disgrace and ruin to the army that has the hardihood to venture it . We must make such efforts as to fix a lasting impression , not only on the enemy himself , but
