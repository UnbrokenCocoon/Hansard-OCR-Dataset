the danger and the toil . This is not a war merely for military glory , for extended dominion , or for powerful allies ; but a war forced upon us by an insolent foe , in defence the constitution , the laws , the religion of this kingdom ; in defence of every thing dear and valuable to a people . Our conduct this night , will , I trust , shew , that whatever may be the differences which prevail amongst us in her respects , it is our 15 unanimous resolution to stand firm in the defence of our Sovereign , and of our own civil and religious privileges . This is a resolution worthy of a free and generous people , fully sensible of the distinguished blessings , which they enjoy , a people magnanimous enough to drop all party interests , when the welfare and security of the nation is at stake . I therefore beg leave to move `` That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty.—To return his Majesty the thanks of this house for his most gracious speech from the throne.—To assure his Majesty that this house is deeply sensible of his Majesty 's paternal care and attention to the safety and interests of his faithful people , in carrying into effect such measures as Parliament has adopted for the defence of the United Kingdom , and the vigorous prosecution of the war.—That it is highly gratifying to this house to reflect , that in those preparations his Majesty has been seconded by the voluntary exertions of all ranks of his people , in a manner which his Majesty has been most graciously pleased to declare , has , if possible , strengthened their claims to his confidence and affection.—That they feel with just exultation , that the measures of the enemy have only served to rouse the native and hereditary spirit of the nation ; and that all other considerations are lost in a general disposition to make those efforts and sacrifices which the honour and safety of the kingdom demand at this important and critical conjuncture.—They beg leave humbly to congratulate his Majesty on the impression which , notwithstanding the necessity of principally attending to the great object of internal security , has been made on the foreign possessions of the enemy , by the capture of the Islands of St. Lucia , Tobago , St. Pierre , and Miquelon , and of the Settlements of Demerara and Essequibo ; and they are fully sensible of the promptitude and zeal displayed by the Officers employed in the conduct of the operations , by which those valuable acquisitions have been made , and by the forces acting under their command by sea and land.—That they have great satisfaction in reflecting , that the leaders , and several of the inferior agents in the late traiterous and atrocious conspiracy in Ireland , have been brought to justice , and that the public tranquillity has experienced in further interruption ; and they earnestly participate in the hope which his Majesty has so graciously expressed , that such of his deluded subjects as have swerved from their allegiance are now convinced of their error ; and , comparing the advantages they enjoy under the protection of a free constitution 16 with the condition of the countries under the dominion of the French Government , they will cordially and zealously concur in resisting any attempt , that may be made against the security and independence of the United Kingdom.—They assure his Majesty that he may rely on the readiness of his faithful Commons , to make such provision as may be necessary for the service of the year , and that they are fully sensible of the importance of persevering in the system which has been adopted , of defraying the expenses of the war with as little addition as possible to the public debt , and to the permanent burthens of the state.—They feel a perfect confidence that their fellow subjects will meet with fortitude , the pressure which the present situation of the country renders unavoidable , under a conviction of the
