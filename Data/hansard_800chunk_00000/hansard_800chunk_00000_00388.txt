inconvenience.—But even in a case where the evil had not spread so far ; yet the necessity of dismissing several corps might happen at a time when you could not well dispense with their services ; and although I have heard it said in a former debate , that if a corps was dismissed , the members of it would enroll themselves in another , yet I must say that it appears to me to be extremely improbable that this would be the conduct of men who had been dismissed in disgrace . At present we are far from the danger of any such inconveniencies being felt ; but we ought to guard against them by putting an end at once to this dangerous practice of armed men holding committees.—But there exists another practice , even still more dangerous than the committees , and which is equally unnoticed in this bill ; I mean general assemblies of whole corps . It is a matter of notoriety , that in this town there are corps of upwards of 1000 men each , in which , upon certain occasions , a general meeting is called for the purpose of discussion.—Now , if this is allowed to go on , who will pretend to say what these discussions will be confined to ? Who will say that we shall not , at some future period , have as many armed Parliaments as there are volunteer corps , meeting to discuss the affairs of the state.—All these meetings , both of whole corps and of committees ought to be declared at once to be absolutely illegal.—There is only one other topic , Sir , upon which , before I conclude , I wish to say a few words . It is not , indeed , immediately connected with the present question , but having been introduced in a former debate upon this bill , I hope I shall not be deemed irregular in adverting to it.—It is a topic , the importance of which , I have frequently attempted to impress upon the minds of his Majesty 's ministers ; and I will never miss an opportunity of doing so.—What I mean , Sir , is the subject of fortifications . In order to consider what ought to have been done by ministers respecting this branch of our military system , it is necessary that I should shortly revert to the period of the treaty of Amiens ; and they have told us , that ever since the signature of that treaty , the conduct of the French government towards us was `` one uninterrupted series of aggression , violence and insult . `` —Now , Sir , I say , that if they viewed it in this light , they ought to have endeavoured to put a stop to it at once by a spirited remonstrance , and if that remonstrance failed of producing the effect , they should have followed it up by a declaration of war . But 597 that under such circumstances , they could possibly think the peace would be of long duration , I will not do them the injustice to believe ; for I should really be ashamed of my country , I should , I say , be ashamed of being an Englishman , if I thought that it was possible for men chosen by my Sovereign to govern this empire , were capable of making up their minds to the continuation f peace with a power , whose conduct towards us , they themselves tell you , evinced a determined resolution to degrade , vilify , and insult his Majesty and his government.—If , therefore , you believe their own declarations , it follows that immediately after the conclusion of the treaty of Amiens , it became their duty to lose no time in putting the country into such a state of defence as should best enable it to resist an attempt at invasion , such as We are now expecting : and amongst other means , there can be no doubt that they ought to have had recourse to a judicious system of fortifications
