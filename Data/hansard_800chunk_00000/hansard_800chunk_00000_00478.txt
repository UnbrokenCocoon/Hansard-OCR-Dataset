what he had suggested could be of any service to the country , he should be glad of it . When lie came to speak upon this subject hereafter , he should have an opportunity of praising or of commenting upon this system , as it should appear to him to be right . observed upon one of ( he clauses , it was there proposed to put volunteers under the command of general officers when they were called out , which they would be in considerable numbers in the various districts of this country , for he knew of nothing so likely to improve them materially in their military exercise . Now , considering the different districts in which they were dispersed , as many of them should be , and he hoped they would he , put on permanent duty as much as possible , they should , therefore , be under the command of an officer of the line . The general rule was , that they were to be put under the command only of a general officer ; now , considering the variety of cases in which they might be out , and the different districts all at once , it might be impossible to provide for each of them a general officer to be their commander ; in which case it might be extremely convenient to put them under the very respectable command of inspecting officers , who were below the rank of general officers , and , therefore , he should move that the words of the clause should run thus , `` such general or other field officer . '' said , it was perfectly clear that lieut . generals were general officers according to military definition ; and this was a point which depended wholly on his Majesty , for he might at his pleasure commission his adjutants general officers , for his Majesty might , beyond all doubt , create the office of adjutant general ; there was such an officer now in France . No doubt his Majesty might give such a rank , and to as many adjutants as his Majesty might think proper , and then they would all take the rank of adj . general , and be to all intents and purposes general officers , and that this was within the general prerogative of the crown , was a matter not 724 to be doubted . Viewing this point as he did , he was persuaded that the words now proposed , `` or other field officers , '' should not be inserted in this clause , for then a lieut . col. might be placed under an inferior field officer . He was , however , perfectly aware that the volunteers should have the benefit of the assistance of officers who were not general officers.â€”With respect to the inspecting field officers who have not the rank of lieut . col. , the assistance from them would be as assistance from the adj . general , which would be that of giving advice and opinion ; but if advisable to give adjutants command , many of them , to his knowledge , were officers of excellent qualifications , and his Majesty might give them rank ; but he was afraid that if words of this kind were inserted , considerable difficulties would arise on account of the point of rank , because many officers might thus be put under the command of those who were inferior to them in rank , which might create unpleasant feelings in the service . He expressed a wish that this matter might take the course pointed out for it , as he conceived , in the system of the militia . seemed at first rather inclined to think the words proposed were necessary , but on hearing his right hon . friend ( Mr. Yorke ) again , his lordship declared himself satisfied that the words were unnecessary . agreed that there was no difficulty whatever when the volunteers were called out for actual service ; ( hat was removed by what was said by the Secretary of State
