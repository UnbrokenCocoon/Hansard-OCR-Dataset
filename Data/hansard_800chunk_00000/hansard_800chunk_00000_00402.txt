ground of She 615 exemptions granted to the volunteers ; but I would ask , can any man seriously contend that such an argument is not well founded , and that those exemptions have not materially impeded the ballots for the militia and the army of reserve , and also crippled the recruiting for the regular army ? The fact is too notorious to be denied . My hon . friend , however , took up these exemptions as a matter justly doe to the volunteers , and highly right in ministers to propose and Parliament to adopt . But , if it was a matter of right , it was certainly right by mistake , for there is no doubt that ministers did pot intend to grant tuck exemptions at the time the volunteer bill was passed last summer . If they did , it doss not appear on the face of that bill ; and sure I am , that it was not so understood in any part of the country that I have heard of . On the contrary , I remember that subscriptions were set on foot in various parishes , to relieve the volunteers from the ballots for the militia or army of reserve , by providing substitutes for such of them as might be chosen for cither of those descriptions of force . Is it possible , then , if exemptions were in the contemplation of the framers of the bill I have mentioned , that it should be so universally misunderstood : and yet , it seems , it was ; for some time after the enactment of this bill , out crime the opinion of the attorney-general , who was not , I must suppose , at all consulted in the first instance ; or the bill would have been explicit . No ! Ministers first frame Acre of Parliament to puzzle him , and then they ask his opinion upon them . His opinion upon subjects thus circumstanced were likely to be erroneous and so they have happened to be.â€”I am flattered that ray opinion respecting the preference of an armed peasantry to the volunteer system happens to agree with that of the hon . officer to whom I have already referred . But my hon . friend has said , that the volunteers would be preferable for active service . I would , however , appeal to his judgment , whether they could be competent to the same duties as a regular army ; and whether they can be fit for any other description of service as an active , hardy , armed peasantry ? The hon . gent . who spoke last has referred to the state of the volunteers in a particular county : but does he mean to say , that the state of our force would not be much improved , that the defence of the counties of Sussex and Kent would not be better secured by the establishment of the principle of an armed peasantry , than by the present ? amount of the volunteer force , to be found hi these or in any of the other counties 616 particularly on the coast ? Some stress has been laid on the advantages likely to arise from the colour of the cloathing , & c. of the volunteers , as contrasted with an armed peasantry ; but this very difference I reckon among the defects of the volunteer system ; and the quibbling remarks on a smock-frocked army are not worthy of reply . If the amount of the volunteers be dwelt upon ; if I am told that we have in them an army of 400,000 men , I answer , that by resorting to an armed peasantry , we might have two millions , and more effective , requiring less drilling , easier prepared for the objects to which it is right to apply them , and less expensive . My principal objections to the volunteers , indeed , arise out of their expense and their mode of instruction , and to the latter particularly . Too much time is employed in endeavouring
