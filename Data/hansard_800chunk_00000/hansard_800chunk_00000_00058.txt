I do , and for several members of the different departments of that government I have the most cordial friendship : but the very interest that I take in their fame , increases my anxiety for an investigation of the mystery , in which this whole transaction is enveloped . Sir , I beseech gentlemen for a moment to mike this case their own : suppose , that while his Majesty 's ministers were exhausting their eloquence in expatiating on the internal harmony and loyalty attributed to a peace which lasted but a twelvemonth , and in the course of which the enemy was detected in devices for sending military spies into the country , a traitorous plot should have suddenly burst on this metropolis , and that , in the exigency of the occasion , the parliament had vested in the crown , the same powers it his given to the lord lieutenant of Ireland : suppose it should have afterwards appeared , that , though a secret powder mill , and a quantity of prepared ammunition , had been previously detected , and the government warned of the danger , by several most respectable persons , yet that no communication should have been 99 made to the privy council , to any of the great officers of state , or to the Lord Mayor , and that the chief justice of the King 's Bench should have been murdered , and the mansion house robbed of arms Imagine , too . that the session should have been permitted to close without any detailed informal ion to Parliament ; that during the recess the attorney general should declare on the trials of the persons concerned in the treason , that the conspiracy was contemptible both n respect to numbers and character , and that it had terminated almost where it began ; and that the ensuing session should have been opened by a speech from the throne , acquainting Parliament , that the public tranquillity had experienced no further interruption , and that his Majesty indulged the hope that the deluded were convinced of their error and were returned to their allegiance : let it be imagined , I day , that , under such circumstances , a minister without the production of a single document , should demand from Parliament a renewal of a martial law bill , I solemnly put it to the honour of every member who hears me , whether he believes this house would adopt such a measure without even asking a question . Sir , it is my firm and honest conviction , that no minister would presume even to make such a proposition . If then we should not pass this bill in our own case without due proof of its necessity , what can be the sentiment of Ireland , if , in the instance of that part of the united kingdom , we should adopt if with the facility , which his Majesty 's ministers seem to recommend to us . Here , Sir , is a source to me of very painful and anxious apprehensions . If we do treat the business of Ireland lightly and superficially if we do appear to act negligently towards her interests , we shall at the same time act offensively to her feelings . The people of that country may begin to draw very unpleasant contrasts , they may say `` in our local Parliament our affairs would have experienced a more grave and serious attention , our antient legislature would not have suspended our rights and privileges without adequate evidence of the urgency of the measure ; '' and thus , Sir , do I dread that the substantial benefits of the union may tie frustrated , and that if his Majesty 's servants persevere in their present deportment towards the affairs of Ireland , I may live to repent the vote I gave for the accomplishment of that great object . I perceive , by the gestures of the gentleman opposite to me , that they mean to accuse me of a course of argument injurious to the public welfare but
