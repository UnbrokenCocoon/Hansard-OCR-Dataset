in those fortresses were left and murdered . Thus ended , Sir , our invasion of Candia ; it begun in January , and before the end of June our invading army Was all either expelled , had died , or were murdered . From the date of the event I have last alluded to , the destruction of our garrison in Candia , to the latest accounts I have seen , which are dated in September last , the situation of the island became every day more alarming ; the Candians elated with the expulsion and destruction of the British had , in immense numbers , invaded our settlements from one end of the island to the other , and , according to the latest accounts , had left us nothing but our forts . The natives or coolies who live under our dominion , men of the most ferocious natures , encouraged by the example and successes of the Candians , were beginning to display the most alarming spirit of disaffec- 858 tion to us ; such of the King 's troops as remained alive were still under the influence of the diseases they had contracted in the Candian expedition ; and , in short , such was supposed to be the danger of the colony on the continent of India as well as at Ceylon , that in the beginning of September , an expedition was fitting out at Calcutta for its immediate assistance . The latest letter that I have seen on this subject is of the 15th of September , and is from Madras ; the writer of it states , as a most extraordinary circumstance , that no tidings from Columbo have been received since the 4th , and from this and from other circumstances I have stated , expresses the roost serious apprehensions for the safely of the island . Now , Sir , if this statement be correct , ( and I am sure in most parts that it is so ) it is , I think , a little extraordinary , that his Majesty 's ministers should never have communicated a single syllable of information to Parliament upon a subject of so much importance ; I apprehend the facts I have stated are perfectly sufficient to induce Parliament to call upon ministers for the most full and minute particulars respecting a war apparently so rash and so impolitic , apparently so destitute of all advantage , and so evidently fatal and disastrous in its effects ; it is the duty of Parliament at all times to examine into and ascertain the objects for which the brave defenders of our country are sacrificed , and it is more peculiarly the duty and the interest of Parliament to do so at this present time . There are , Sir , likewise , circumstances connected with this war , and consequences arising out of it , that more imperiously call upon us to inquire into the conduct of the governor , and which I will briefly state to the House . When we first took possession of Ceylon it was not the least of our advantages , that we took with it all the experience of the preceding settlers , the Dutch . The Dutch had made this particular experiment of subduing the Candians over and over again , they had twice , with as little loss as ourselves , seized the capital and expelled the King , but on every occasion their army was finally destroyed by the same causes which have destroyed ours . It is singular , Sir , that on one occasion the precise calamity which has lately befallen our garrison at Candia befell the Dutch . The Dutch garrison at Candia were compelled to capitulate , and , on their march , and within two days journey of Columbo were , to The amount of 400 men , all murdered . The effect of these experiments upon the Dutch was to convince them , that all attempts upon the interior of Candia were not only 859 fruitless , but fatal to themselves ; and , accordingly , for the
