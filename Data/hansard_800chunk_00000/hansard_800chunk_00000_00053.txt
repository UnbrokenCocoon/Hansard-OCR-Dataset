several gentlemen , who are well able to correct me . On the commencement of the rebellion in the year l798 , the lord lieutenant , with the advice of the privy council , issued orders ( notified by proclamation ) to the officers commanding his Majesty 's forces to employ the troops under their command with the utmost vigour and decision for the suppression of the rebellion ; the rebellion , however , extending itself insomuch that several very daring attacks and outrages were committed both on the troops and on the persons and properties of many loyal persons , the lord lieutenant , by the advice of the privy council , directed all the general officers commanding his Majesty 's fortes , to punish all rebellious offenders according to martial Jaw . This order was likewise notified by a proclamation , which , together with the former order and proclamation , was communicated to parliament ; and the houses of lords and commons by their addresses , expressed their entire approbation of those measures , with assurances to his excellency of their cordial support . Nevertheless the rebellion continued so late as the year 1799 in several parts of the country , and the ordinary course of justice and of the common law was in many places interrupted , in consequence of which the martial law bill was enacted . All these particulars , Sir , are set forth in the preamble to that act , which will be found among the Irish statutes now before you ; and I can not omit to remark that , when the bill was introduced , there were on the 92 table of the Irish house of commons two reports of two secret committees , which contained a very minute and detailed history both of the system and extent of the treason connected with the rebellion , and the last of the reports had been presented so late as the end of the preceding session . In the year 1800 the law was revived , but in fact it was to be considered as a continuance of the former act passed upon the grounds I have stated ; and it is to be observed too , that at the opening of the session the lord lieutenant had stated in his speech from the throne , that , though public tranquillity had been in a great measure restored , there still continued in several districts a disposition to outrage and conspiracy . In the year 1801 the act of the former year was , about the period of the King 's recovery , continued for a very short time , by the united parliament , without an enquiry and it was in the course of the same session renewed a second time ; but upon what pr needing did the house then adopt the measure ? On a report from a secret committee actually recommending it.â€”And you , Sir , then chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland , brought in the bill upon that specific ground . Now , Sir , let me ask , whether the house possesses such information in the present instance , as that to which both the Irish and the united parliament were thought entitled , when on former occasions they have passed this measure ? From the introduction of the law , which this bill is intended to continue , to this moment we only know that there was a rebellious insurrection in Dublin , on the 23d of July last , in which Lord Kilwarden and his nephew were murdered . The extent of the conspiracy , whether there were any correspondent movements in the North or South of Ireland , whether any papers were found developping the object of the treason , are points of which parliament has been kept in a state of the most profound and humiliating ignorance . When the message communicating the insurrection was delivered I was absent from town , but I have on a former occasion declared , that , if I had been in the house , I should have given my vole for the
