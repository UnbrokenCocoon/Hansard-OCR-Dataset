had been exploded at least two centuries ago ; —that this learned person should till the office of a great legislator , and the highest as a legal magistrate , cud that he should be appointed to preside in , the only country where such antiquated doctrine could do effectual mischief & I do not I say it is a fault , but it certainly is a great misfortune that such a person , with such sentiments , should be placed in such a station . I can not augur favourably of the disposition of a government , in which such sentiments prevail nor do I think it likely that Ireland can ever be tranquillized , as long as they shall be acted upon . I can not think it likely that those pictures of quietness , contentment , and happiness , which have been so gratuitously afforded to the House , and so diligently laid before it , that the rebellion was at an end for ever , that the principle on which it was fomented was destroyed , that Ireland was , by the rooting out of prejudices , become one body of harmony in temper and united in object will ever be realized , if the policy is to be that to which I have just alluded . Jam willing to give government credit for their intention to do away all animosity in Ireland . I do not mean to say that the correspondence to which I allude is to be considered , nor do I state it , as a fire-brand which threatens the country with destruction , but I do state , that great officer , as enjoying the full confidence and a great portion of the power of government , and whether he was the intended vehicle of publishing such sentiments I do not know , yet it has all the effect of design , and I can not help looking upon the publication of such sentiments as conveying to the public the animus of government . Whether these sentiments are really the sentiments of the government , or no , I will not pretend to say , but the great character to whom I have alluded is a member of the Irish government ; and the government in winch such a mind predominates—that is to say , a mind governed by such principles as have been published by that I great person who had great influence—where such a spirit presides—and where such a spirit rules , and such opinions are cherished , the government , influenced by it , I am sure , can not be conciliating , nor agreeable , nor can it held forth any prospect of comfort , to say nothing of happiness , to the Irish people ; a government which permits itself to cherish such sentiments , discovers an animus 762 that affords no comfort to those who are governed ; it is an imprudent government , and very ill adapted for the safety of the public—As to the vigilance of the Irish government now , when they have been roused by two explosions , that appears to me as no reason why the present inquiry should not be gone into . With respect to the manner in which the affairs of Ireland were neglected previous to and on the 23d of July , I contend , that the negligence of government was so great , as not to keep on their stations the most important officers of state . Mr. Wickham , a gentleman who from his station and talent might have rendered essential service to Ireland , at the time of the insurrection , had not been desired to remain on his post , but was on an excursion of pleasure , and actually in Yorkshire when , the first intelligence reached him of the insurrection in Ireland but , however , no blame attaches to this gent , upon this occasion ; it only makes the accusation the more weighty on those who ought to bear it . No consideration of the weight of personal responsibility on any body ought to induce the House to
