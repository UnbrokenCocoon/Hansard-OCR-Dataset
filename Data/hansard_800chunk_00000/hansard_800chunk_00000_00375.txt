into the discussion as I shall be enabled to do on the day which v , ill , I hope , be appointed for that investigation which they challenge and I desire ; but I shall seize this opportunity of taking a general view of the subject . I hope I shall not detain the House very long ; but I do net think it necessary to offer any apology for delaying ( if I can not prevent ) your leaving the chair , because I do not conceive it possible that the House should feel impatient to go into a committee upon such a bill 579 as this.—I shall begin , Sir , with that which I presents itself to most men 's mind as the first and most important part of the public force , I mean the navy . Upon this I shall only say a very few words , —It certainly is nor ivy intention to bring any direct charge against : he Admiralty , for ibis plain reason , that I am nit at present possessed of sufficiently accurate information upon which to ground it ; but , Sir , I can not sufficiently express my astonishment at the two and only modes of defence which have lately been resorted to in this House when the conduct of that department has been called in question.—The one is by a comparison of our present naval establishment with that which has been kept up and found to be sufficient in former wars . But this species of defence , Sir , is good for nothing , unless it can be proved that the present situation of this country , with respect to the enemy , is similar to our situation in the periods referred to.—Now I will not enter into any reasoning to prove that no such similarity exists , and that the attack with which we now are menaced is , beyond all sort of comparison , more , formidable than any that we were formerly threatened with ; because I feel that it would be an insult to the House to take up their time in proving that which must be evident to every man of common sense.—This species of defence , by comparison , is therefore , I say , good for nothing ; and really , Sir , it does appear to me that the other which was set up by a Lord of the Admiralty , is equally absurd.— '' We are told that the low rate of insurance is a proof of the sufficiency of the exertions made in the administration of the naval department . The low rate of insurance certainly proves that few of our ships are taken ; but what is that owing to ? Why , Sir , it is in a great measure owing to this , that the enemy does not attempt to take them . He does not think it worth his while to be nibbling at the fruits of our industry , when he is preparing to strike at the very root of it , and to dry up the source from which all our commerce flows . The French government not only does not encourage the fitting out of privateers , but absolutely forbids it ; and is collecting all the seamen that can be procured either in France or the neighbouring countries , for the purpose of preparing that grand explosion by which they hope to overwhelm us . This mode of defending the conduct of the Admiralty is , therefore , as little to the purpose as the other ; nor can they satisfy the doubts which are pretty generally entertained in any other way than by shewing , cither that they have done all that was positive to be done , or that they have done as 580 much as the exigencies of the times require . I have said that I do not mean to bring any direct charge against the Admiralty ; but I certainly have heard enough to make me wish that the subject may soon be brought regularly before the House by a right hon
