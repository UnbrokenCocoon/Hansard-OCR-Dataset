against the most formidable attack that ever was prepared against it.—And when I contemplate the nature of that attack , the immense numbers and the excellence of the army by which it is to be made , their inveterate hostility to us , and the consequent enthusiasm with which they will embark in this enterprize , the uncontroled power and extraordinary talents of the man by whom they are conducted ; —when , on the other hand I take a view of the immense powers which this country possesses , and consider how , by the false measures of the ministers , these powers have been , I will not say misapplied , but actually shackled , repressed , and deprived of half their energy and action ; when I consider all this , Sir , feel myself bound by the most sacred duty is endeavour to prevent our proceeding any further upon such a system , and shall therefore , propose that instead of going into a committee upon this insignificant bill , we should rather appoint a day for taking a more enlarged and general view of the military system of the country.—Sir , when I speak of the formidable nature of the attack that is preparing against us , and express my opinion that our defensive measures are defective and insignificant , I beg I may not the understood to think that there is a danger of the country being absolutely subdued by the enemy . A zealous but rather an indiscreet friend of his Majesty 's ministers , has said in their praise , that under them the nation governs itself ; and so , I trust , Sir , that notwithstanding their mismanagement the nation will at least defend itself against ultimate subjugation.—That event I will put out of the question.—But is it enough for us to know that this empire is not in danger of becoming a province of France , would it not be in the highest degree disgraceful and unworthy of Britons to rest satisfied with the assurance that we shall not be entirely conquered by that enemy , with whom we and our ancestors have so often and so gloriously contended ? I do not say , Sir , that we ought not for a time to stand on the defensive : but our defensive should be of such a sort as would enable us not only ultimately to repel an invading enemy after a long and distress- 577 ing contest , but almost instantly to annihilate or drive back into the sea the army which should have been rash enough to set its foot upon our shores.—Such is not our present situation ; but it might have been such , if the ministers had made a proper use of the time that has elapsed since we were warned of the attack which is now , perhaps , near at hand . In order to repair , as much as possible , the effects of the measures which they have pursued , would require a much more complete , revision and amendment of them than any thing which can be engrafted on the present bill ; and , therefore , it is that I oppose our going into a committee upon it—if this Majesty 's ministers in framing this bill had aimed at something great , even although they should have so bungled the execution as to render it inadequate to the attainment of their object , still , Sir , I should have entertained good hope ( founded upon my own parliamentary experience ) that , in its progress through the House , the bill might have been so improved and corrected , as to have become a great and a useful measure . These hopes , I say , would have been founded upon my own parliamentary experience , because I do recollect , that the bill which they introduced last session , for the purpose of enabling his Majesty to call upon a great portion of the people to join in the defence of the empire against an attack which even then was thought to be near at
