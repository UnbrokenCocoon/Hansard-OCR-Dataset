this council ? —Undoubtedly , Sir , his Royal Highness 's staff is composed of very able and respectable officers ; but they , too , are fully engaged with the details of their respective departments.—It has also been urged , that ail the general officers who are employed , are , in fact , his council , as he has constant opportunities of having recourse to their advice ; but here , again , I must object , not only that these general officers are greatly occupied with the particular business of their respective commands , but also that their being necessarily dispersed , at a great distance from the commander in chief , and from each other , is an obstacle to their rendering at service , which might be expected from such a council as I have in view.—But let it not be supposed that I am proposing a council , for the purpose of controlling the commander in chief , in the direction of the active operations of the army in the field . What I mean to recommend is a council , comprising within it some officers of great experience and acknowledged abilities , who would devote the whole of their time to the nature investigation of every means , that might be proposed by others , or should occur to themselves , for increasing our military strength , digesting and combining the whole in to one great and comprehensive system.—The establishment of such a council , of which the commander in chief would be president , and the master and lieutenant general of the ordnance ( amongst others ) would be members , would have the advantage of uniting and bringing , under one view , those different branches of the military service which are now independent of each other ; as every thing relating to the military branch of the ordnance department would come under its cognizance , —I say the military , as contradistinguished from the naval branch.—I also think , that , without being accused of speaking slightingly either of his Royal Highness the commander in chief , or of the noble lord at the head of the ordnance , I maybe allowed to say , that any proposal for the defence of the country , coming from such a council , would carry with it greater weight 264 than if proceeding either from the commander in chief or from the master general and that ministers would feel , that in neglecting to attend to such a recommendation , they would take upon themselves a serious responsibility.—Ministers , indeed , and those who approve of their conduct , contend , that nothing necessary for the defence of the empire has been neglected ; from whence they infer , that we have not felt the want of such a council ; but , as I deny the premises , I can not grant the conclusion . I contend , that there has been much neglect and mismanagement ; and , to prove this assertion , I must shortly revert to a period which was referred to in the former debate , I mean that immediately subsequent to the treaty of Amiens.—Without at all entering into the merits of that treaty , I shall merely say , that , even if after the conclusion of it , the conduct of the French government had been apparently pacific ; yet , when we consider that by that treaty we recognized them as legitimate sovereigns of the Netherlands , and that the possession of that country , which at any time would have given France a predominant influence in Holland , does in the present state of Europe give them the absolute command of it ; it undoubtedly behoved us to adopt a new and more enlarged military system than had ever before been deemed necessary , and to employ ourselves during the peace in strengthening our means of defence in proportion to the increased means of offence which France would possess in case of a renewal of war.—This , I say , was obviously necessary , even supposing the conduct of the French government
