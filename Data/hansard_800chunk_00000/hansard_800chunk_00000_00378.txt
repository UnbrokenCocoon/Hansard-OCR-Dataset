nay even the cloathing itself , in short , all and every part of the system I do most entirely disapprove of.—In the first place , I shall take notice of the exemptions , because ( as I have I frequently said before ) I consider these to be I the greatest evil of the whole system . It ii totally unnecessary for me to take op the time of the House by tracing the origin of this 583 evil . For I am sure that every member must be convinced , as I am , that the volunteers having become entitled to these exemptions was solely owing to the blunders of those who framed the bills . I have , indeed , on former occasions , heard one of his Majesty 's ministers attempt to deny it ; but they most prove to me that I have been afflicted with some malady which deprives me of the power of recollection , before they can persuade me that I am mistaken in this assertion . In the army of reserve bill no exemptions were intended to be granted , except to volunteers who had been enrolled before that measure was brought forward : in the general defence bill the only inducement held out to voluntary service , was that , in districts where a sufficient number came forward to enroll themselves , the compulsory clauses of that act should not be enforced . This , I say , was the only exemption that was intended by Parliament , or expected by these who volunteered under the defence act ; and I consider it as a libel on the spirit and patriotism of the people , to say ( as it has been said ) , that they required any further inducement.—The mischievous effects of that extraordinary blunder , by which the intentions of the legislature have been so completely counteracted , are , in my opinion , nothing less than to cripple and weaken every branch of the public force , the regular army , the army of reserve , the militia , and even the irregular or volunteer force itself : for so long as the present system is persevered in , you can not have volunteers without exemptions from ballot , and you can not grant exemptions to so large a proportion of the people as ought to be in arms . It is to this latter effect of the exemptions , I mean their operation in preventing your increasing the number of your irregulars , that I shall chiefly direct my observations upon the present occasion : not that I think this ' the most important part of our force , of that , I finally shall not be suspected : my partiality to one of a different description , I mean to a regular army , is , I believe , well known , and it did in the last sessions induce an hon . gent , whom I do not now see in the House , to give me the appellation of the Regular Colonel ; he meant it as a joke , but I contess that I felt myself obliged to him for it ; I am proud of it ; I am happy to be distinguished from the colonels whom one now-a-days meets in every street of the town . I wish that all my brother officers , of the same rack in the army , were distinguished by the same appellation ; I wish we were ail called regular colonels.—3t has been justly observed by a right hon . friend of mine ( Mr. 584 Windham ) , that the profusion of military titles bestowed on the volunteer officers has completely deprived those of the regular army of that honourable distinction in society which they formerly enjoyed , as , perhaps , the only reward for having devoted themselves to the risks and hard hips of a profession , in which they must necessarily sacrifice those advantages which are generally considered as constituting a very great portion of I he comforts of life.—This is no longer the case ; this gratification we
