harbours , remains blockaded in one of her naval arsenals by the persevering vigilance of Admiral Cornwallis , and in the other , by a noble admiral , with whose exploits in the same quarter , she has had some former acquaintance.—With respect to the recent events which have taken place in Ireland , I can address your Lordships on that subject with a considerable degree of confidence , having been there previous to the breaking out of the insurrection , pending it , and for many months after it was put down . A conspiracy , fomented by the intrigues of France , was formed , having for its avowed object the overthrow of the government . The energy , the firmness , the vigilance , and the moderation with which it was followed up by the King 's servants there , gave universal satisfaction to all the loyal inhabitants . It was traced to its wry source : not only even ring-leader , but also every conspicuous person concerned in it , was discovered and brought to punishment , after being allowed the fullest benefit of those mild , just , and lenient laws , which , in their madness , they wished to have overturned . I will also further assure your Lordships , that French fraternization is now appreciated in Ireland , at its just value , and if , by the misinformation of their emissaries , the enemy should direct their meditated attack to that quarter , they will find , I here pledge myself to your Lordships , a vigorous resistance from every rank and every persua- 6 sion of the inhabitants.—A continued perseverence in the wise system of defraying the weighty charge of war , with the least possible permanent burthen on the public , can not be too much commended . It is by that only our national credit can be . pre-served , and that France will learn , that the plans she may have formed for exhausting our resources , are as vain as any others she may have in view for our destruction.—With respect to the Convention concluded with the King of Sweden , when the papers on that subject are before your Lordships will be he properest time for examining the merits of that convention ; I will , however , take leave to say now thus much : in all I have seen , and all I have read , treaties between independent nations are lasting and beneficial , in proportion as they convey equal and reciprocal advantage to both parties : if , therefore , our just rights are obtained , and all indispensably necessary to us is secured , without infringing on the rights of another independent kingdom , all that could be wished for is accomplished.—I come now , my Lords , to the concluding paragraph of the speech ; in which his Majesty , in language never to be forgotten , declares , that , embarked in one common cause with his brave and loyal people , he confides to them the honour of his crown , determined in his own person to share with them their exertions and their dangers . The feelings to which such sentiments give this , it would not be easy to express ; I could dwell on them with pride and pleasure : but I have trespassed already too much on your Lordships indulgence , and , in truth , I have nearly exhausted my own strength , and , therefore , though could have wished to have added a few words more , I must conclude with a fervent prayer , that the beloved Sovereign , who has reigned in the love and admiration of his subjects for nearly half a century , may long continue to fill that throne Whatever calamities hang over us , may danger be far from him ! And , when taken from us to a other and a better world , may the remembrance of his unexampled virtues be lastingly impressed on his successors , as the highest ornament to this nation in its prosperity , and the best pledge
