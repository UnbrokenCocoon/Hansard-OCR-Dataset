recognized by the house at large . This is all that I wish to say upon the subject of the present address , either generally or in detail.—One word more only , upon a matter of a different sort , and which I am tempted to introduce to day , principally because it is the first occasion that offers , and because no man can say , in our present circumstances , whether the first occasion may not be the last , nor how soon we may be called away , as was observed by an honourable gentleman yesterday , to the performance of duties more active at least , if not more important , than those which we have to discharge in this house—It will equally with the other subjects which I have touched upon , lead to no debate , nor require from the honourable gentlemen opposite to me , even an answer.—I am come , in common with many other gentlemen , from a residence of some time in my own country : and upon the result of that residence , what I have to declare is , that should any great stroke be struck in the county of Norfolk , of the sort that has been pointed out to the honourable gentlemen , and for want of those precautions , which have likewise been pointed out to them ; I shall , certainly , think , that there will be grounds of serious criminal charge against the honourable gent . and should the case not be such as , by the very magnitude of the evil , to put an end to all proceedings , to sweep away both accuser and accusation , 'To take at once the poet and the song , ' I shall probably feel it my duty to stand forward as the bringer of that charge.—More than this upon the present occasion need not be said , nor could , perhaps , be said with propriety . I had prepared , before I left Norfolk , a representation upon the subject , 38 and proposed it to a meeting of gentlemen assembled for other county business , wishing to have transmitted it to government with the advantage of their signatures : but , for reasons , which they , of course , thought satisfactory , which were not explained , as in fact no discussion was invited , and which I shall not presume to guess at , they declined to join in the representation . It was my duty to afford them the opportunity ; as I conceive it to have been my duty now to mention the subject in the way that I have done.—The honourable gentlemen will not consider me as bringing a charge against them , at least not one of which it is necessary for them to take notice , as it must rest for the present solely on the authority of the individual who brings it , unsupported by any proof . As a menace even , the honourable gentlemen will be entitled to hold it cheap , if they are confident that no blame can be imputed to them , but that every thing has been done , that can or ought to be done . It is as a menace , however , that I intend it ; as the only means which I now possess of compelling attention to objects , which , in my apprehension at least , require to be attended to . This is all that I have to say upon this point . Upon the general topick , I trust I have sufficiently explained myself , and shall therefore no longer detain the house from voting the present address , with that unanimity , which , under the explanation now given , I shall be happy to see it received . The address was then read a second time , agreed to , and ordered to be presented to His Majesty by the whole house ; and those members who were of His Majesty 's most honourable privy council were ordered humbly to know His Majesty 's pleasure when
