also remained in the country ; and of the regimental officers ( that description , at least , who before the revolution chiefly resided with their corps ) a very great proportion did not leave France.—But admitting , as I do , that great part of the troops engaged at Jemappe had not been engrafted on the regiments of the line ; still , I say , they were perfectly unlike what our volunteers will be at the commencement of an invasion . They had been long embodied and in the field ; and a great part of them had been engaged in a successful and , what they no doubt would consider to be , a glorious campaign : for a general of the highest reputation at the head of an army , esteemed to be at least one of the best in Europe , had retreated before them . It must also be recollected , that in this battle of Jemappe , of which we have heard so much , general Dumourier , according to the most credible accounts , had between forty and fifty , or even it has been said , sixty thousand men , against about sixteen thousand Austrians , so that at any rate it can not be considered as any great proof of French prowess ; and if they do plume themselves upon it , I think they have little to boast of.—This example of the noble lord 's does not , therefore , in my opinion , prove anything in favour of our volunteer system ; but it does so happen , Sir , that the late war affords us what I should consider as a much better test of the comparative me- 586 rits of the numerous armed peasantry for which I contend , as contrasted with such a force as our volunteers , I mean . Sir , that glorious example set to the world by the Vendéan peasants ; an example which ( if Britons need look for any thing to emulate out of their own country ) we should never lose sight of . The national guards , who first attacked the Vendéeans , were very like our volunteers , well armed , and provided with a numerous artillery ; the Vendéans , on the other hand , could scarcely be called an armed peasantry ; for the fact is , that in the outset of the contest , a great proportion of them had no ether means of providing themselves with firearms but by wresting them out of the hands of their enemies . Yet , even in this state ( many of them having nothing but pitchforks ) , they attacked their opponents with irresistible impetuosity , took from them the whole of their artillery , and completely destroyed this army of volunteers.—Large bodies of troops of the line afterwards marched against them , but were ; likewise defeated . When they , on the other I hand , had the worst of it , they used to disperse so rapidly , that the enemy saw nothing to pursue or strike at ; and they assembled again as quickly whenever they chose to renew the combat . Now I say , Sir , with such an example of what has been done by a rude peasantry , totally without discipline , and , in the beginning , almost without arms , what might we not expect from our own , if the great mass of the physical strength of ; the nation was prepared to co-operate with our regular forces , instead of being excluded , as three-fourths of the stoutest and youngest men in the country now are , and disgusted ( as they must be ) by the exemptions which you grant to the volunteers ? No nation upon earth possesses a larger share of natural courage than the English ; and , if you take the proper means to call forth their exertions , they will defend their country with as much enthusiasm as was ever displayed by any other people . So confident am of this , that whenever the invasion I
