hand , was drawn up in such a manner , that had it gone out of the House as it came into it , the whole of the volunteer force would , to this very hour , have received only one day 's drilling . The object that was aimed at by those with whom the idea of that bill originated , was , certainly , a great one ; but it was very generally reported , and I believe upon good grounds , that it did not originate with his Majesty 's ministers . I have reason to believe , Sir , that the great outline of it was suggested to them by a right hon . gent . ( Mr. Pitt ) whom I am grieved to see in a private station , at a time when the country stands so much in need of the aid of ail those most distinguished for their abilities—Yet although his Majesty 's ministers had contrived to fill up the outline that was given them in so unskilful a manner , yet the bill , in the course of its progress through the House , received such corrections and . improvements as would have rendered it a great and powerful weapon , if it had been put into the hands of a government that was capable of wielding it.—But , Sir , the outline of the present bill is so confined , that there is no room to work in ; the basis is so narrow , that nothing great can be founded upon it as 578 well might one attempt to erect a palace on the scite of a cottage , or to build a line of battle ship on the keel of a jolly boat or a wherry.—I say , Sir , if we would effect any thing great , we must not proceed upon this insignificant bill , but must come to a complete revision of our whole military system . Let it not , however , be supposed , that I would recommend , at this moment , to undo any thing that has been done , with a view to any future and distant improvement , I certainly would not make one retrograde step ; for although we have , long been kept in a state of constant expectation of invasion , yet I do think that the period is now arrived when that event may certainly be supposed to be near at hand ; both because the enemy has had full time to make , his preparations , and because at this season of the year the easterly winds most commonly prevail . What I would propose , therefore , is to pass as quickly as possible from a bad system to a good one , not ( as I said before ) by abruptly undoing what has been done , but by improving what is faulty , and adding what is deficient.—This being the principle upon which I would proceed it becomes impossible , for me to defer expressing my opinions until we go into a committee upon the bill ; and I am the more inclined , Sir , to take it up in the present stage , because I confess that something , which lately fell from the Chancellor of the Exchequer , made me wish to seize the earliest opportunity of again commenting upon the measures which have been adopted for the defence of the country.—Upon that occasion , Sir , ( I mean the second reading of this bill ) the Chancellor of the Exchequer threw down the gauntlet and challenged the House to prove that he and his colleagues had not done every thing that could have been done to provide for the safety or call forth the strength of the empire . I take up the gauntlet ; I accept the challenge I desire that a day may be fixed for the investigation ; and I pledge myself to prove , that since the commencement of the war our affairs have been grossly mismanaged.—I can not , indeed , on the present occasion , go so much at large
