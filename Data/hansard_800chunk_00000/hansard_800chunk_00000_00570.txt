believe , Sir , that all our attempts to subdue the natives of these countries must prove not only fruitless bat fatal to ourselves . I think , Sir , if this war shall appear to have been as rank and impolitic in its origin and commencement , and as calamitous in its consequences as I have stated it to be , I think the opinion of this House will be , that there is abundant matter for enquiry into this subject . There are too , Sir , transactions of this war that I have touched upon before , which I apprehend the House must likewise think call for particular enquiry : I allude to our interference in the politics of Candy ; of our dethroning and making of princes and new forms of government in that country . If , Sir , we are really in earnest when we profess our respect for established governments , and our abhorrence of all usurpations ; if we really wish for any character of consistency in the eyes of Europe , upon this important subject , it is high time that we bestow some criticism upon the very singular transactions of our colonial governors . I am not aware , Sir , of any other reasons I can adduce in support of the enquiry I wish to be instituted ; but before I conclude , Sir , I beg to advert to a very cruel and unfeeling account that has lately been published by his Majesty 's ministers , purporting to be a dispatch from the government of Ceylon , and giving an account of the murder of our garrison at Candy . This letter , Sir , is an attempt to account for the final disasters of this war , and which rest entirely with the governor by insinuations the most fatal to the honour and character of a British officer who has fought and who has perished in the service of his country and 861 this , Sir , in the absence of any species of testimony on which such insinuation could be founded I do entreat this House , on behalf of the character of this most unfortunate officer , to recollect Low he was situated : —there were only 200 British troops , 100 of those were sick in their beds ; the remaining 40 , I presume , were not very healthy , they were surrounded by at least 10,000 Candians , they were cut off from provisions , and they were 60 miles from our nearest settlement : in this situation they were ordered by our new ally , the First Adigar , to lay-down their arms , and they were deserted by the Malays in our service . Does any man believe it to be physically possible that these 40 men , so unhappily circumstanced , could have cut their way through all these difficulties ? Of this , at least , we may be certain , that had they attempted so to do , the 160 who were sick would have been murdered . I contend , then , that if in the absence of all testimony respecting the conduct of this unfortunate officer , we allow ourselves to speculate upon his motives , we are bound in fairness to believe , that he W3s influenced by a very natural and generous sympathy for this great majority of his sick and helpless fellow-soldiers , and that in acting as he did , he consulted what he conceived to be the best , not only for himself alone , but for the whole garrison of Candy.—Mr . Creevey concluded by moving for `` Copies of all papers , letters , and dispatches , from his Majesty 's governor of Ceylon to the government of Candia in that island , and from the Candian government to his Majesty 's governor respecting the cause or origin of the war in Ceylon : 2 .
