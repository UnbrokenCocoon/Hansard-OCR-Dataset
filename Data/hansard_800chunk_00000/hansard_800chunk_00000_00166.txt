lord should be adverse to any plan or measure , for the suppression of rebellion . On the other hand , it was a very serious matter to vote for measures of such magnitude as those now before the House , independent of all evidence of their necessity . At this moment , the only official information which the House had of the state of Ireland , was contained in his Majesty 's speech from tire throne . He desired their lordships to consider what was the effect of the information so communicated . Why , the fact was , that four months after what the noble Secretary of State had been pleased to call the transaction of the 23d of July , his Majesty 's ministers had advised his Majesty , in his speech from the throne , to assure Parliament , that , since that time , there had been no appearance 252 of insurrection , but that , on the contrary , Ireland had remained in a state of undisturbed tranquillity . How far this was an accurate view of the state of Ireland , he had not tire means of ascertaining . This , however , he had to observe , that it was the only official knowledge since the 23d of July , laid before Parliament , relative to the present state of Ireland . It was worthy of observation , however , ' the language used respecting this transaction . On the one hand , it was represented as a most formidable conspiracy ; while , on the other , it was described as a most contemptible riot . How were their lordships to judge amidst such contrariety of statements ? How were they to judge of the necessity of measures , the necessity of which could only be judged of by an accurate knowledge of the circumstances on which the bills were founded ? Their lordships must see that they were proposed on grounds very different from any that had hitherto been brought forward . In proof of this , he needed only to refer back to the circumstances under which they were introduced at former periods . At their first introduction into the Parliament of Ireland , their lordships were aware that rebellion actually raged in the country that armies were levied by the insurgents , who disputed with the troops of his Majesty the possession of the island . After the experience of such circumstances , the bills had been repeatedly renewed by the local legislature of Ireland . How did the matter stand at the commencement of the first session of the United Parliament ? By the local legislature the duration of the bills was limited to the twenty-fifth of March . At that time , certain circumstances which would be in the recollection of their lordships , but which it was not now necessary for him particularly to explain , prevented the necessity of any inquiry being instituted , as to tire propriety of renewing the bills . It was judged , however , and in his opinion very properly , that it was not giving too much credit to the local legislature to allow them on their authority to be renewed for a short period . The bills were accordingly renewed on the same grounds . But what was the course which Parliament immediately thought it expedient to adopt ? A Secret Committee of both Houses was appointed , and it was not till the report of these Committees was produced , that the legislature re-enacted the bills . So far , generally , he must be allowed to say , that no evidence of the necessity of either of the bills was laid before Parliament.â€”He wished to make some observations more particularly calculated to explain his objections to 253 the Martial Law Bill . In the outset of the few observations which he had thrown out to their lordships , he had remarked that the noble lord who began the discussion , had not been altogether correct in mixing the question of the renewal of both the bills . As to the bill for the renewal of
