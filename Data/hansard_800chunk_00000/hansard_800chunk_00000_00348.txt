military habits acquired by die men had 540 induced them to inlist in the regulars , in a far greater proportion than the same number of men otherwise would have done , during both the last and present war . From the St. George 's corps , from 11th March , 1795 , to 1801 , out of 600 , or at most 780 men , 94 had entered the navy , and 337 into other regiments . During the present war , from the same corps , 40 had already inlisted . So , of the Norwich corps , consisting of 300 , 25 had , during this war , already entered the army He mentioned this to shew that the volunteer system did not retard the recruiting the army of reserve.â€”With respect to the election of officers on which some strange opinions had been formed , the right hon . gent . seemed to think there were two points presented themselves ; 1st , as to the matter of right in the first formation of the corps to elect their own officers ; and , 2dly , in case of vacancy , the right to supply that vacancy by ballot . The right hon . gent . must have completely mistaken him , if he supposed that , on a former occasion , he had even admitted either the one claim or the other . It had never been recognised by any act of the legislature , nor was it in fact the intention of government to give that right . No such faith had been pledged , in this instance ; but where it occurred it ought to he considered on the part of government as sacred . It was a totally different thing from the first formation of the corps , and their subsequent efficacy as a military body . In the first instance , it might be requisite to allow them to present officers for the approval of the colonel commandant , by him to be transmitted to the lord lieut . of the county , from thence to the Sec . of State , and from him to the throne , for the approval of his Majesty . The impolicy of canvassing for the election of officers would be obvious . Suppose the corps were called out into actual service , and a vacancy of 3 or 4 officers in each corps was to arise , the time that would be taken up in canvassing and balloting to supply the vacancies would be of the greatest detriment to the service . In fact , the point of practice in this particular had been completely settled , there was , consequently , in his opinion , no necessity for going into the discussion . The right hon . gent . then adverted to the observations made by Mr. Grenville , with respect to the arms for the use of the volunteers , and contended that if any gentleman thought blame imputable to government for not making a better provision in that respect , the same degree of blame would attach upon the government during the last seven years of the late war . In order to shew that his Majesty 's present government were more upon 541 the alert , and provided better for the defence of die kingdoms he would state a list of the quantity of arms in the Tower , and the several out ports , for several years past . In 1755 , previous to the breaking out of the seven years war , there was 36,098 stand of fire arms in the Tower , & c. : in 1775 , during the American war , 98,488 : in 1783 , at the conclusion of the war , 94,786 : in 1790 , during the Spanish armament , 92,131 : in 1793. commencement of the French war , 53,482 : and in 1803 , at the commencement of 'he present war , no less than 329,246 stand of arms ; he did not state this to hew any superior attention of the ordnance department , but merely to prove that government
