one , which , in any possible view of the subject , can be either expedient or proper . I certainly do feel , that if , unfortunately , the moment should come , which I most earnestly hope will 518 never be the case , when Parliament shall be obliged to take cognizance of a suspension in the exercise of the royal functions , from that moment I think , on the constitutional ground staled by the hon . gent . opposite to me ( Mr. Fox ) , that Parliament should be precluded from doing any act , except that of taking the necessary '' measures for supplying the deficiency in the executive branch of the constitution ; This is an opinion I have always entertained , and this is the conduct which was adopted by Parliament on a former melancholy occasion ; and although , at the period to which I allude , there was a very considerable difference of opinion as to the particular mode which ought to be adopted , vet I believe the general principle which had been laid down was universally approved of . But I certainly do not think , that a mere general apprehension and impression , however well founded they may appear to be , that the personal exercise of the royal authority has been suspended , would justify Parliament in suspending all its other functions , unless that fact was communicated to them in a way that would render it necessary for them to take notice of it . If however , the regular reports of the physicians appointed to attend his Majesty , should induce gentlemen to think , that , it is the duty of ministers , under all the circumstances of the case , to take immediate steps for making a communication to Parliament upon the subject , it is not only proper , but it is the duty of those members who entertain that opinion , to inquire of ministers why they have not made such communication to Parliament ? I confess I feel that it is a most difficult and arduous responsibility for ministers to determine , how long the communication ought to be delayed , and at what moment it ought to be made . Whatever my opinion of ministers may be on other points , I am sure there is no man in his Majesty 's councils , who does not feel that responsibility which , great as it must be at all times , and under any circumstance , is , in the present state of the country , increased tenfold . Looking , as I do for one , with the feetings I have always cherished , to the possibility of reaching the moment of the complete restoration of his Majesty 's health without the necessity of any interference on the part of Parliament , yet I certainly do feel , that , in the present critical situation of the country , we must count by days , and even by hours , in judging of the interval that ought to be allowed before the interference of Parliament becomes necessary , I must , 519 therefore , say , that it would become ministers , well and maturely to consider the situation of the country , in deciding upon the line of conduct they ought to adopt . Ministers ought , and of course do know more of the state of affairs than other persons ; the may be acquainted with circumstances , which may warrant them in thinking that a delay of a few days may be hazarded ; but , every member in this House , every man in the country , knows that the country is threatened with a danger which may produce the most awful crisis it ever experienced . I , however , do not know to whom ( unless upon a supposition of criminal negligence ) except those persons who , in consequence of tills calamitous event , are left in the situation of his Majesty 's actual ministers ; I do not , I say , know to whom , except to them
