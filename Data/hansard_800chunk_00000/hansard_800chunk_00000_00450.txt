, so that when they did attend they not only manifested their own imperfections , but , from the nature of military exercise , they must of necessity impede the progress of others in their improvement ; and then there was some levity to be expected from the age and habits of some of them , so that to his mind moderate compulsion was in a considerable degree essential to their attaining the height of military perfection , of which with attention they were capable . He knew it was more popular to compliment them all , and to say that they wanted nothing , but he thought that pursuing this course without informing a system by which they might be essentially improved , would be the highest imprudence ; and here there was more necessity for making some regulations than there had been in the first instance ; since Parliament had formerly enacted particular matters positively , and then said that such other rules and regulations should be adopted as to his Majesty should seem meet ; thereby evidently conveying an idea , that many things would seem meet to be done by way of rules and regulations which were not specified or pointed out by that law ; but to his Majesty 's executive government nothing did seem meet to be done beyond the strict provisions of the statute , which amounted to a 683 hint to Parliament , by way of caution , that if they wanted any thing to be done , they must enact it specifically ; that if they trust to the executive government to do any thing more than was duly set clown for them , Parliament would be disappointed ; therefore , if there were any rules and regulations at all necessary , Parliament must point them out , or they would never be adopted , for which reason he had in his pocket a clause for this purpose , which he should hereafter offer to the House.â€”There was a declaratory clause in the bill at present , which related to the power of resignation in a volunteer , which , in the present condition of things , required one alteration , and that was , to turn every negative in it into an affirmative declaration .

That learned gent , gave an opinion upon the question of a volunteer 's power to resign . Another very distinguished gent , give an opinion directly opposite to it , accompanied with great eloquence , and more solidity of judgment than might have been expected to accompany such diffusive eloquence , and the learned judges of the court of King 's Bench determined with the opinion of the latter gent , and held that a volunteer had , by law , a right to resign when he pleased , and without any condition ; now this bill was drawn by those who said nothing of any doubt being entertained on this point while the thing was doubtful , who declared that the opinion of the court of King 's Bench was so consonant to their wishes as to what the law should be , that if they had not so decided they would have brought in a bill to make the law so . But how did these very persons now declare that law ? They now left the day in blank in the bill to be filled up by the committee , and as to the law which the court of King 's Bench had decided , saying , that a volunteer might resign in any manner , and when he
