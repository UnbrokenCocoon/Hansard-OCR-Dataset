to the Castle , to receive such information as might have been procured by the subordinate officers of the government . He had come to the Castle , on the 23d , and after receiving the information respecting the projected insurrection , had held a consultation on the expediency of his remaining in the Castle , the result of which was , that it was considered better for him to return to the Park , as the circumstance of removing his family to town might create considerable alarm . Every body who knew his lordship , would do him Use justice to suppose that he would not leave Dublin from apprehension on such an occasion ; nor was it probable that he should consider a Serjeant 's guard in the Park a better security than a garrison of 4000 men in Dublin . thought , that as a charge might arise out of the statement that had been made , either against the Irish government , or the Commander in Chief , that the hon . Admiral might , notwithstanding the explanation that had been given , bring forward his motion , though not for crimination for the justification of his hon . rela- 149 tion.â€”The question was then put , and the bill ordered to be read a third time tomorrow . adverted It a motion which had been made by him during the last session of Parliament , respecting the dismissal of a gentleman from his employment in his Majesty 's dock yards .
