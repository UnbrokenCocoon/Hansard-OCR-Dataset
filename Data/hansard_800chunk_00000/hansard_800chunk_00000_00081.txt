was every ground for the reverse ; and I implore gentlemen not to be persuaded into any such most dangerous opinion.—We who are deputed on the part of Ireland to assert her rights , to uphold her interests , and to enforce her claims , appear amongst you in consequence of the most solemn engagements made to us on the part of your King and of the Nation.—I complain of the neglect and duplicity of the present ministers , which , if not calculated to alienate the affections , have , at least , marred the hopes ; but I trust not irrevocably destroyed the confidence of the Irish people . I trust it is not in the power of those who have proffered Union to be the cause of separation , and having sworn to uphold the throne of their Sovereign and Master , they will not , I hope , be suffered by their conduct to endanger the integrity of his empire . The responsibility they have incurred is possibly more than they are aware of . They are not to compare themselves with any other minister who had ever had to advise as to the management of Ireland : and should they persevere m their neglect and indifference to the interests of that country , he should hope to see them one day at the bar of another house , where the penalties , however heavy , which they might incur , would be but a poor and inadequate atonement for the mischiefs which the prosecution of their present system is likely to entail upon the United Empire.—I venture to hope , that as so many gentlemen have so humanely adverted to Ireland , and have manifested a generous interest in her fate , that the House will speedily consider the means of relieving her ; that while they give additional strength to the executive , they will , at the same time , think of administering some comfort to the people ; for surely it is not 131 unbecoming the dignity of any government , or the wisdom of any legislature , to prove that it combines the power to repress rebellion , with the determined disposition to remove all ground of complaint and dissatisfaction .

On reading the amendment , which makes the duration of the Bill six months after the conclusion of peace , called the attention of the House to an important alteration in this bill from that of the last year , which took place in a very thin committee on Saturday last . It was in filling up the blank for the duration of the bill , by the insertion of the words `` six months '' after the ratification of the Treaty of Peace , instead of `` six weeks , '' which was the time expressed in the last bill . He did not mean to oppose the alteration , but felt it his duty to call the attention of the House , as it had been made in so very thin a committee . admitted , that the alteration alluded to by the hon . I member , was certainly important ; but he trusted the House would agree with him that it was also necessary . It had been thought inconvenient to make the bill continue only for six weeks alter peace , because , if that should happen in the recess , and it should be found inconvenient to allow the Bank to I pay off in each so soon afterwards , Parliament must assemble for that very purpose ; whereas , if Parliament should be sitting , and six months
