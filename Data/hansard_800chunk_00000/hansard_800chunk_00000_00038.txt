insurrection , meets with my entire approbation . Their firmness and humanity ; their activity and attention , entitles them to the utmost praise . They have in a great measure pursued that line of policy , which the wise and just would always recommend to be observed towards Ireland . Their temper and lenity have tended to cultivate the good opinion of the people ; which was precisely the course , which , at the close of the last session of parliament , I had entreated should be adopted ; an exhortation by the bye , which seemed to have been much misconceived ; and for offering which , I became the subject of severe and unmerited censures , from particular quarters : several paragraphs ( I should be ashamed to suppose from authority ) were inserted in some of the Dublin papers , and also in those of this city , tending to decry the individual who had attempted to call the attention of parliament to the affairs of Ireland . I was quite unconscious , on that occasion , of having given any provocation to the friends of the noble earl , at the head of the government of that country . Such was not my object ; as it was , and is , matter of indifference to me , by whom the offices of state are filled , provided government be well administered : in the mode of that administration I am , so far as relates to Ireland , particularly , interested . Connected to her by all the sacred ties which can bind an individual to his country , strengthened by a respect for the talents , a regard for the virtues , and a warm sympathy in the wishes of its inhabitants : eager as I feel for their welfare , rejoicing in their prosperity , and participating in their afflictions , I can not but sincerely lament the necessity which ministers feel themselves under , for again resorting to parliament , for the measures now proposed . But , that under the present circumstances of that unhappy country , it is advisable thus to strengthen the hands of the executive , I can not entertain a doubt : and I feel the less reluctance in again entrusting the Irish government with these extraordinary powers , when I reflect upon the moderation and lenity with which they have hi- 69 therto been exerted : and having on a former occasion expressed my regret , that the conciliating conduct , and uniform attentions of Lord Hardwicke and his family to the people of Ireland , had not been met by that co-operation of legislative exertion , which I for one had anxiously recommended , I can not but lament , that this my avowed opinion , should have been either totally suppressed , or perverted.â€”I trust , I shall not , in the few observations I am about to make , subject myself to the imputation of wishing improperly to obtrude the ; discussion of the state of Ireland . Of misrepresentation alone do I feel the least apprehension : on a very late occasion , I had an opportunity of adverting to the situation of that country , I mean when the motion was under consideration for an address to his Majesty , but I abstained from any comment upon the speech from the throne , not wishing to disturb the unanimity , or damp the zeal which prevailed in the house ; and because I felt , that at such a period , when attacked by the most inveterate enemy , and the most ambitious government , this country ever had Jo encounter , no man of loyalty , or of understanding , should hesitate to declare his resolution , unburthened by conditions and unalloyed by expressions of discontent , to support hi '' Majesty in the prosecution of a war , in which , in my humble judgment , his empire is necessarily engaged . I was sincerely glad to hear from my Sovereign on the day to which I have alluded , that rebellion had been put down in
