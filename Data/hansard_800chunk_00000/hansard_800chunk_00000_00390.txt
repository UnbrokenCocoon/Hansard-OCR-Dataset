occupying a strong position which is situated near the enemy 's line of operation , that is to say , near the line by which his supplies of all sorts must pass from his magazines and military depots to his army.—In such a position you may stop his progress or oblige him to attack you at a great disadvantage for , if he went forward and left your army behind him in this situation , you would effectually cut of this communication with his magazines.—But although this indirect mode of opposition may sometimes be effectual in a regular military operation on the continent ; yet it can not possibly be imagined that in our situation we should , by proceeding in this manner , stop the progress of an enemy , who , from the very nature of his enterprize , must abandon all idea of preserving communications . Does any body imagine , that if he lands on the coast of Essex he 599 will begin by forming a magazine , and that in advancing into the country he will take care always to preserve his communication with this depot ? Certainly not.—He will push on rapidly towards London , trusting to the effects of a sudden irruption : and in that case , how can the camp of Chelmsford stop him ? It can not , as I have said before , throw any direct obstacle in his way , because there are so many other toads in the country which will answer his purpose as well as that which ii commands , and that in order to pass this camp , without attacking it , he need not make a detour of above two or three miles . And if we remain in it after he has passed it , what will be the relative situation of the two armies ? —Ours will be in his rear , and will threaten his communication with , —what ? Why with the coast on which he landed , and on which he has left nothing behind him : —Whilst he , on the other hand , will be between us and the capital his approach to which we ought at all hazards to prevent . In short , Sir , I can not conceive that in the present state of things this camp can be of any use , unless the energy are such fools as to run their heads against it rather than take the trouble of turning it.—Having thus expressed my opinion of what has been done ( at least in this instance ) , I will not enter into many details of what might have been done , but will just mention one or two points so extremely obvious , that even men , who are not military , will readily feel the force of them . It is a matter of public notoriety that our depots of military stores are at present in a perfectly defenceless state ; whereas , if his Majesty 's ministers had made a proper use even of the time which has elapsed since the renewal of war , two or more of these great depots might , without any very extraordinary exertion , have been fortified in such a manner as to have been perfectly secure against a coup de main or assault At present , it a temporary superiority or advantage gained by the enemy should render it impossible for us to prevent his approaching these depots , he may either greatly distress us by destroying them , or , what is still more important , may find in them supplies of military stores , of which he , at the time , may be in the greatest want.—The advantage of securing them is too obvious then to require any reasoning to illustrate it ; and if it should be denied that there has been time enough to do it , even since the commencement of the war , I can only say , that I should be very glad to have an opportunity of proving it by indisputable calculations , —There is another point in 600 which our
