, in a crisis so fall of danger , in a contest so singular in its character , and which perhaps maybe tedious in its duration , we ought to superadd to the regular army some permanent system of national defence , either to a certain degree compulsory , or formed upon the voluntary zeal and patriotism of the country itself . This ought to be resorted to as the grand source of domestic security . The army must be the rallying point ; the army must furnish example , must afford instruction , must give us the principles on which that national system of defence must be formed , and by which the volunteer forces of this country , though , in a military view inferior to a regular army , would , fighting on their own soil , for every thing dear to individuals and important to a state , be invincible . Looking at the nature and probable turns of the contest in which we are engaged , I wish to see that system of defence employed , not merely for domestic security , but so matured and regulated , as not only to carry the volunteer corps to as high a degree of perfection as such bodies can be carried , but also to enable us to use the regular army in its full extent , in any way which circumstances might point out as eligible , either for annoying the enemy where they are assailable by our separate efforts , or on a large scale , should a prospect open for contributing to the deliverance of Europe from the oppression under which it groans , and for the reduction of that ambitions power , by which the peace of the world is disturbed.—Contemplating all these great and important objects , I can not but rejoice that the volunteer system has been formed . I see nothing to complain of government for the extent to which it has been carried ; neither do I complain that it has fallen short of what we could wish or expect . I wish only that in the provisions which were enacted , with regard to its extent , the numbers had been allotted with some relation to the local posi- 190 tion and peculiar danger of the different parts of the country ; I only wish that when it was fixed generally , that the volunteer force might be six times the number of the militia , a greater proportion had been assigned , or a facility had been reserved , of increasing it in the maritime counties ; or in those most vulnerable and most exposed to the first attacks of the enemy . I am sorry that a different distribution was not adopted with reference to the grand object of resisting and repelling the attempt of invasion , in the first moment it should be made . I am confirmed by the opinions of much better judges than I can pretend to be of such a matter , that a much smaller force would be sufficient to harass or defeat the enemy on their first landing , than a much larger force , after they bad-landed and recovered from the effects of their voyage . Both , therefore , with regard to the economy of money , but with regard to a much more important economy—that of lives , it would have been desirable that the number of volunteers should have been increased and encouraged in proportion to the proximity to the coast , and to those points which are most liable to attacks . Such a distribution as to the means of defence would be more effectual , and much more desirable , on account of the object . Although the force as now allotted , might and would , when put in motion , be adequate to defeat the enemy 's attempt , yet it would be painful to think that any progress should be made in the invasion of this country , and if the volunteers from the more distant parts should at last arrive to take their share in the victory , yet
