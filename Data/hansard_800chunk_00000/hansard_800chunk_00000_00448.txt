a question which he did not know how to argue . Whether it was better to be taught by those who have a perfect knowledge of the thing to be learnt , or by those who knew it imperfectly , or by those who did not know it at all , was a thing which he could not argue , because his mind knew not how to argue that upon which it was unable to conceive the application of an argument , since nothing could be matter of rational argument upon which it was inconceivable how a doubt could be entertained upon it ; and , as to the matter of economy , upon a point so essential as that of knowledge for the volunteers , in order to make them efficient in service and most essential to the safety of their 680 country , and when he considered that this economy involved only a question of a few shillings per man , enable such an immense body as the volunteers to be of eminent service to their country , and to with-hold that instruction which could alone make them thus useful , for the sake of saving such few shillings , was a species of economy which did not enter into his understanding . Comprehending it under the head of the general scale of the expenditure of a war like the present , and compared with the general scale of our means of defraying that expenditure , great as that expenditure must be , or considered with reference to our resources , and feeling that this expense may amount to a few thousand pounds , was that which , considering the utility of the measure on the one hand , and the expenditure on the other , he knew not how a representative of the people of this country , bound to adopt measures for their general welfare , could possibly regard as a question . Ministers themselves admitted that this instruction to the volunteers was desirable ; but they said there were but few instances , in which the officers so wanted , could be procured ; certainly they would be few , if ministers were determined to give them so little encouragement . He knew it was impossible to over-rate the exertions of gentlemen of fortune and distinction in the country , for the purpose of rendering the volunteers as nearly perfect as possible ; he knew no limits to their zeal and ardour , but that must be confined to those districts in which they resided , whereas persons of great skill and eminence might be found , who , from a combination of untoward circumstances , had been obliged to give up a career of glory in the profession of arms , from want of a prospect of advancement consistent wish their age or talents , and to retire into the obscurity of a country village , in a stale , if not of penury , certainly far from opulence , who could not transfer 3 family from a distant part of the country to which he had retired for the prudent purpose of that economy that was essential to his existence , into another where his services might be rendered by way of instruction to others , and by which he might renew and rekindle that flame which was only clouded , but not extinguished in his breast by pecuniary disappointment , and add more laurels to his life , if this encouragement were held out to him . This was not an imaginary character that he was drawing , he had an opportunity of knowing several such , one of whom he had an opportunity of serving and of bringing into a state where his talents had been eminently useful.â€”Having expa- 681 tiated upon this subject , he said , he hoped there was no objection against the volunteers availing themselves of assistance of such immense value as this , in such a crisis as the present . He should be sorry , indeed , if any difficulty should stand in the way of this most important point , upon which , however
