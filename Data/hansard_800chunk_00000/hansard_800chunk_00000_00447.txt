government to judge of the circumstances . Now , this , in the first instance , would have been very well bat , he had a reason , which he would soon state , for not thinking that the executive government ought to have this discretion now . It did not appear to him that the executive government had judged wisely upon this occasion ; they seemed to have thought themselves confined to the 20 days , and to give no more time than Parliament gave for this purpose , and that appeared to him to be a very good reason why Parliament should now think I that 20 days are sufficient ; nor was there any objection to make provision upon this ; head specifically under the present circumstances . When the House was voting a sum of money as a vote of credit , it was usually left to the executive government to judge how much of it should be issued for any particular purpose : yet , when the House came to judge how much money should be allowed for a specific object , is was more regular and constitutional for the House to regulate the mode of effectuating that object ; so that when Parliament came 10 vote the money to defray the expense on this matter , it should stale the number of days which shall be occupied for this purpose.—Nor was this at ail entrenching upon the principle by which the other branches of the military service of the country was conducted ; he meant that which was in any degree analagous to the present , the militia . In that service , Parliament specified what money ( he officers and men should he paid , and also the number of days the privates should be ( raised and exercised , and he did not see why Parliament should not be as distinct 679 and specific on the subject of the volunteer service as that of the militia ; but this , again , he did not mean to discuss now , he merely threw it out in passing , as a matter fit hereafter to be discussed.—As to the means of instructing the volunteers by field officers and adjutants from the regular service , he threw that out for the consideration of ministers ; he did not intend to produce any clause to that effect ; but , unquestionably , if he did not see more disposition than had been hitherto shewn by ministers to make some provision for that purpose , he should feel it his duty to bring forward a measure for that purpose for the consideration of Parliament , not by way of clause in any bill , for it would come more regularly by way of address to his Majesty ; but he would be satisfied to hear from ministers , that the volunteers should have the benefit of the instruction of officers detached from the line , during the period of permament duty of the volunteers ; but he saw an unwillingness in ministers to allow pay to any field officer for thus instructing the volunteers . He should not , at present , go into the ground of that objection . The committee would recollect that the very first day he stated this matter , he accompanied his statement with a declaration , that he did not wish that such officers should be provided for any corps who did not expressly desire to have that species of instruction , and who should actually apply for it , nor did he propose this at all with any view but that of such officers being mere temporary assistants to the commanders of the volunteer corps . Ministers said , that in many instances it was done , and the whole question was a question of expense : it must be desirable that the volunteers should have the best instruction they possibly could have , and , therefore , whether they should be instructed by those who knew but little , or by some who knew nothing of that which it was essential for the volunteers to learn , was
