manufacture in each country would justify the House in acting upon such principle ; and here it was material to be recollected that linen was the staple trade of Ireland . said , that the schedule of the taxes laid before Parliament last session was very generally circulated among the merchants in Ireland ; but he was ready to admit that there was some difference between that and the schedule now before the Committee . recommended , that time should be taken to examine and compare the schedule now before the Committee with that of last year , which his right hon . friend had stated to have been circulated among the persons interested in the taxes referred to ; and if any substantial difference should be found to exist he was sure that his hon . friend would be as willing as any member of the House , to press the adoption of the bill until the Irish merchants should have full opportunity to canvass the merits , and to state their opinions upon every part of the schedule ; at the same time he begged to call to the recollection of gentlemen , that 3 years had now nearly elapsed since it was known to be in contemplation to render those taxes perpetual , that is to say , to assimilate the concerns of the Irish revenue to the practice which prevailed in this country , and to the soundness of the principle , he conceived , that no objection could be offered , for cither the proposed annual review of those taxes must be a mere parade , or the public creditor must be , inn great measure , insecure .

The motion was agreed to that the Chairman should report progress , and ask leave to sit again to-morrow .
