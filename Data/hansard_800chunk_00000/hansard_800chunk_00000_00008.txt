indispensable importance of upholding the dignity , and of providing effectually for the safety of the empire.—They return their thanks to his Majesty , for his gracious intention of laying before them the Convention which his Majesty has concluded with the King of Sweden , for the purpose of adjusting the differences which have arssen on the subject of the 11th Article of the Treaty of l66l ; and they trust that it will be found at once to uphold our maritime rights , and to produce the effect of maintaining and improving the good understanding which happily subsists between the two countries.—That they are most deeply convinced that it will be , as it ever has been , his Majesty 's first object to execute , as becomes his royal dignity , the great trust with which he is invested ; and they receive with the strongest feelings of veneration and dutiful attachment the expression of those paternal sentiments which induce his Majesty to consider himself as embarked in one common mon cause with his people , and which have determined his Majesty , if the occasion should arise , to share their exertions and their dangers in the defence of our constitution , our religion , our laws , and independence.—They beg leave humbly to assure his Majesty , that these sentiments will not be lost on an affectionate and grateful people , but will animate and invigorate the activity and valour of his fleets and armies , and the zeal and determination of his faithful subjects , to which his Majesty , under the protection of Divine Providence , may safely confide the honour of his crown and all those important interests which are involved in the issue of this momentous contest.—Partaking of these his Majesty 's sentiments , and joining with his Majesty in humbly imploring the blessings of Divine 17 Providence , they look forward with a firm conviction that if , contrary to all just expectation , the enemy should elude the vigilance of his Majesty 's fleets and cruizers , and attempt to execute their presumptuous threat of invading the coasts of the United Kingdom , the consequences will be to them discomfiture , confusion and disgrace , and that the exertions of this kingdom will be rewarded , not only by the glory of surmounting present difficulties and repelling immediate danger , but by the solid and permanent advantage of fixing its safety and independence on the basis of acknowledged strength , the result of its own tried energy and resources .

Small indeed , I am well aware , is the influence which any argument of mine would produce , but I rely with confidence on the unanimous vote of the House in support of the motion of
