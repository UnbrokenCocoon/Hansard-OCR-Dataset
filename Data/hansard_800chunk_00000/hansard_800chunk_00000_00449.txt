, he should not say any more at present.—The next point was , that of the appointment of officers of the volunteers , on which the right honourable gentleman agreed it was better not to make any legislative provision ; he originally thought so too , and the only doubt with him was , whether something had not been rendered necessary by the point having been so much and so unnecessarily agitated , in order that the authority of the legislature might set the matter at rest.—Upon the subject of signing the commissions of officers in the volunteers , he thought the practice which had hitherto been fallowed , that of giving them all the sign manual , highly objectionable ; not only because it was so very laborious , and in its nature productive of unavoidable delay , insomuch that officers were obliged to wait for months for their commissions ; but also because the thing was absolutely unnecessary , for they might be under the same regulations as the commissions of the militia , which were signed by the lieutenants of the counties , except in cases to which the crown did not : asaent.—There was another point on which he had the misfortune still to differ from the right hon . gent . : he meant with regard to the propriety of making regulations to discipline volunteer corps by means of parliamentary provision , instead of leaving that matter to the discretion of the executive government , and for regulating their attendance , and taking due care of their arms , & c. He had prepared a clause upon that subject , and which he must still offer , for he would venture to say , it was the general complaint of all officers of volunteer corps , that there were some among them who , not for want of any good will , for that he knew the whole mass of them possessed in something almost equal to perfection , but from those ideas which were inseparable from all men who had not a great deal of experience , did not bestow on the office of a volunteer , that attention which was absolutely requisite to complete that character . There would be husbandmen , and there would be artisans , who would chuse to think that they were soldiers , somewhat sooner than their officers might think them entitled completely to that character ; the consequence was , that they would appear only on some shewy day , when but little advantage was to be obtained 682 from the drill . He did not say the volunteers had not done , in general , very well , but of this he was sure , that in one half the time they took up at first they would gain more than double the knowledge , for in this , as in every thing else , it was after some knowledge was painfully gained , that knowledge was easily and rapidly acquired , and without more and fuller attendance , perfection was not to be obtained . He knew it was very popular at present to say that the essence of the volunteer system was to leave every thing to voluntary exertion ; that there was no necessity to enact any tiling , that the zeal of volunteers would do every tiling , that there was nothing to fear from their want of discipline . Much of this sort of doctrine might be at present popular , but it was a species of popularity which a man who loved his country , and who gravely considered its true interest , would not seek . He knew the volunteer corps were a body of men open to good sense , and he was of opinion they might easily be persuaded in the bulk to assent to some measures of compulsion , not that they ail needed compulsion to perform their duty , but because some of them did ; for it was not unknown to any corps , that there were among them some who were less often at the drill and less attentive when there than others
