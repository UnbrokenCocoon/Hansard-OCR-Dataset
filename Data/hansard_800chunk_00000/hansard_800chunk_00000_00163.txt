indispensable duty of Parliament . He had pledged himself already to several of his friends in private , and he now distinctly pledged himself to the public , that unless some noble lord of greater ability took up the subject , he should certainly feel it his duty to bring the subject of the affairs of Ireland under the serious consideration of the House . He wished to explain to the noble Secretary of State opposite ( Lord Hawkesbury ) , the views which he entertained en this subject , and the sentiments which he felt respecting the best mode of proceeding in the redress of Irish grievances . He begged leave to remind their lordships of what took place when the rebellion in Ireland , during the reign of Queen Elizabeth , was suppressed , It was then the advice of one of the greatest and wisest men that ever existed in any age of the world , ha meant lord Bacon , to her Majesty 's government , that they should appoint a commission to enquire into the existing grievances of the people , and to consider of the most effectual means of redressing them . This was sound advice , which every wise and humane government would be disposed to follow . Force might put down rebellion in the field ; but it was only the union of lenity and justice which could restore the alienated affections of a people behaving themselves to labour under hardships of a most grievous nature .

The fact was , that not a single tittle of evidence had been produced , to establish either their expediency , or , what was more important , their necessity . Ministers had called upon their lordships to pass bills , which they themselves allowed to be of a description only to be resorted to on . occasions of an extraordinary nature , without adducing a shadow of evidence , to prove that the situation of Ireland was such as to : require such proceedings . It was not to be forgotten , that such a call was not of a trivial or unimportant kind . It made an appeal I to their lordships of a description which demanded the most serious consideration .
