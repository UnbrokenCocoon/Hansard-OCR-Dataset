takes place , I should be happy ; o command a body of sturdy peasants , even although they were armed only with pikes ; and if I did not find an opportunity of performing some action that would do honour to them j and to myself , I think I should deserve to be dismissed from his Majesty 's service.—And now , Sir having said so much on the superiority of an armed peasantry over our present volunteer establishment , I think it will be as well to describe shortly , what I mean by an armed peasantry , and in what respect they would differ from the volu- 587 teers.—In the first place , their numbers would be three or four times as great , and would comprize the whole of the first class of the people , three-fourths of whom a right hon . gent . ( Mr. Yorke ) has told us , are not now enrolled . 2dly , their dress , if any distinction of that sort was adopted , would be much less expensive , consisting merely of a short coarse great coat , which , with their arms , a small knapsack , and a bag for their provisions , would constitute the whole expense of their equipment ; and 3dly , their instruction or drilling would be simple , natural , and strictly confined to that which could be really useful to them when acting as irregulars in the field.—I should of course give fire arms to as great a proportion of them as possible , and pikes to the rest until fire arms could be procured—For the purpose of teaching them the use of their arms , I certainly should prefer gamekeepers and poachers to any militia serjeants in the kingdom ; for I should wish them to learn no more than just what every one is taught when he first goes a shooting . All that I would require of them is to load the piece well , and to handle it in such a manner as not to injure themselves or their neighbours but to hit their prey . Provided they could use their arms with effect , I would never plague them about forms ; and whether they carried the firelock in one way or another , on the right shoulder or the left , would be to me a matter of perfect indifference . So much for the use of arms . As to manœuvres , they should be so extremely simple that the principles of them might be taught in a very few days . Some practice would , indeed , be necessary to make them expert and ready in applying these movements to all the variety of ground ; but there is a most essential difference between such a mode of employing their time and that which is now pursued ; for what I recommend would be a lively , active and amusing exercise , and exactly resembling what they would have to do upon actual service . I would teach them to take advantage of the circumstances of ground ; to line a hedge in such a way as to expose themselves as little as possible to the enemy 's fire ; to advance rapidly to another position whenever there was an opportunity of gaining ground ; to retreat with equal rapidity and line the hedges in their rear , whenever they found themselves pressed , and to condense themselves into a compact body and dash into any opening that might present itself , in the enemy 's line , wherever his evident disorder and their great superiority of numbers should induce the officers who led them 588 to think it prudent to charge.—Such , Sir , is the armed peasantry that I would recommend instead of our present volunteers ; and so far am I from agreeing with those who think that the latter possess any qualities which can at all be put in competition with the great superiority of numbers of the former , that I really think that in every point of difference , the advantage is in favour of
