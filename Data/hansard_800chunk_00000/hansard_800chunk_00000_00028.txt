'' Ordered . moved the order of the day , for renewing the debate on the motion for excusing Mr. Pedley from his attendance on the Waterford committee . said , he conceived it to be his duty to state to the house , that affairs of an urgent nature having called the hon.gent . mentioned in the motion , to the island of Jamaica , and that the gentleman having long since taken his passage , it was moved that he obtain leave of absence from the committee on the Waterford election , on * The following is the circumstance to which the hon . member alluded : â€”In consequence of the great inconvenience experienced at Portsmouth from the scarcity of cash , a meeting was held , pursuant to advertisement , at the Guildhall of that place , on the 22d of November . The mayor presided ; and , after some discussion on the means of alleviating the difficulties and inconveniences so , seriously felt at Portsmouth and Portsea , for the want of gold and silver for the purposes of trade , it was unanimously resolved , that dollars should be admitted into temporary currency , at 4s . 9d . each , but that no person should engage to take more than four in one payment ; and French crowns at 5s . and half crowns at 2s . 6d . 54 which he was appointed .
