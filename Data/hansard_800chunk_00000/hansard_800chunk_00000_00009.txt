my honourable friend , because the experience of the last session of Parliament has taught me , that whatever shades of difference there might be in political opinions on speculative or theoretical points , however gentlemen might disagree in their sentiments of past measures , or of proposed plans of defence , yet , whenever the welfare of the King , the country , or the constitution , was at stake , this House possessed but one opinion and one voice.—Let us , then , at the commencement of a session , during which it is probable the fate of this country will be decided , set an exam- 18 ple of unanimity to the British empire ; let us not by dissentions here paralyze the efforts which a generous and patriotic enthusiasm is making for the preservation of the country.—If , Sir , any argument was necessary in favour of unanimity , from what source could I deduce it better , than from the disunion , the selfish politics , and the lust of partial aggrandizement , which have deluged Europe with blood , and involved the innocent and guilty in one common ruin.—But , Sir , I feel no apprehension of the want of unanimity , either within these walls or without . The moderation which his Majesty invariably shewed throughout the whole of the last war , the disposition which he at all times manifested to conclude a peace on fair and honourable terms , and the opportunity of which he availed himself to accept proposals of peace as soon as they were offered , have convinced the people of the necessity of the present war , and have united them in the prosecution of it . I fear not the want of courage in the people , or of vigour in the Government ; but there is a circumstance from winch I confess I do entertain some apprehension ; because , if the threatened attack is postponed to a more distant period , it may diminish the energy of the people , and may induce them to despise that danger , which I wish them to view alike without contempt or without dismay ; it is from that improvident and overweening security which pervades many parts of the country . There is a language which I frequently hear used , which is in my opinion of so pernicious a tendency , that I have always thought it my duty , both as a magistrate and a man , to re-probate and refuse it . It is a very common phrase in all parts of the kingdom , to which I think every gentleman who now hears me can bear witness , that our present alarms are imaginary , that Buonaparté is as well convinced of the impossibility of invading this country a we are , that his preparations are only meant to alarm us , and to involve us in a ruinous expense . Now , Sir , if those who hold this language would consider the character of the enemy with whom we are to contend , if they would recollect that he invaded Egypt , and carried his arms further in that country than European troops had ever I penetrated before , at a time when he was engaged in a war with all Europe ; if they would consider the armament which covers the coast of France from the Texel to the Bay of Biscay ; if they would recollect that he has hitherto invariably attempted whatever he has threatened ; that humanity , which forms a barrier to the ambition of other men , is no obstacle to his views ; that of so small 19 estimation is life itself in his mind , that the sacrifice of thousands nay of whole armies , is no impediment to Ins progress ; if they would reflect on these circumstances , I think they could not for a moment doubt , that he will attempt the invasion which he has threatened What the event of that attempt will be , it is not for human wisdom to foresee , but this it may be
