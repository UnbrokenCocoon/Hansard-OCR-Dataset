as he had described , in respect to the other services ; 2dly , a militia , excellent in its kind , but incomplete , and rendered more difficult to be completed by the effect of the measure above referred to ; 3dly , twenty , or six and twenty thousand army of reserve ; and 4thly and lastly , an addition , ( as he should have said ) of 5,00O , or ( as he now understood from the hon . gentlemen ) of 7,000 men to the regular army ! This was all that the hon . gentlemen had produced at the end of nine months , and as the fruit of all their labour and travail . This was all that the nation had got , in return for its large contributions , its ready sacrifices , its heavy expense , both of patience and money , five thousand men to the regular army , five pints of reasonably good soup , was the whole that these state-cooks had been able to produce after all their simmerings and boilings , all the hams and chickens , and pounds of beef , which they had melted down , and the bills which they had run up in consequence at the different shops.â€”Thus far he had gene in considering what a great philosopher of old would have called the living instruments of our defence . The inanimate instruments must not be overlooked , though he should say but little to all the objects which that class would comprize , such as works , fortresses , preparations by sea and land , every thing that wisdom and foresight could provide or could arrange , towards making the approach of an enemy difficult , or giving force and efficacy to the action of those who were preparing to resist him . In all this he feared a dreadful deficiency . Much as might be wanting in living means , the want of judgment and ability in the application of those means , the want of a presiding mind either to create resources , or to turn to account those already existing , he feared was not less considerable . He would not attempt to enter into a criticism either upon the general distribution of the forces , which so far as it was built upon a system of concentration , or of collecting the force into great masses for the protection of vital parts , he certainly approved , nor would he offer any opinion as to the considerable works going on at Chelmsford and Chatham , having in fact , no opinion to offer . He would touch upon one point only of that sort , and that not so much with a view of stating what he thought 173 ought to be done , as of remarking on what was done , and upon the dreadful weakness and inconclusiveness of many of those reasonings , which governed the conduct of the country , in points where its very existence was at stake . From the northernmost point on the coast of Suffolk , where the protection might be supposed to cease from the shipping at Yarmouth , to a part of the coast of Essex , where a naval defence of another kind might be supposed to begin ; ( and where he hoped it had at length begun , though , very late in the year it certainly had not made its appearance ) , there was a line of coast accessible in most weathers , and certainly very commodious for the landing of an enemy in such vessels as those in which they were expected to come . Upon this line he should unquestionably , think it highly advantageous if a defence were provided , formed by the construction of what were known to our officers under the name of Martello Towers , a species of edifice so called from a memorable instance of one at Martello in Corsica ; where by s tower of this sort , garrisoned by some ten or half dozen men , and mounted with about two guns , a ship
