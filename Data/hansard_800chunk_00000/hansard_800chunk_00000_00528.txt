the persevering spirit and sense of the right hon . gent , opposite ( Mr. Windham ) , who hid awakened the people to a sense of their danger , without ; terrifying their minds or exciting their fears ; and which had led to those exertions that have put the country into a situation , far beyond the apprehension of danger.—In a hapless hour , however , the fatal , the favorite , but wretched system was like a pestilential disease wafted over to Ireland , and to this he did really believe was to be principally ascribed all the evils which have followed.—The House would please to remember ( they could not forget it ) , that some weeks previous to that fatal day , he had in that very place where he then stood , spoken his belief of the forthcoming mischief . He was treated with attention by the House , but his Majesty 's ministers and their friends heard him with disdain.—The country was then , as he feared many parts of it would be found now , in that state of silent , but perceptible stir , which has ever preceded every great explosion , and which has been the constant harbinger of deadly mischief.—All is tranquillity , said the friends of the administration—all is quiet , quiet , Mr. Speaker , said his lordship ; so is gun-powder , if you will let it alone . In respect to the transaction to which the attention of the House had been called by the hon . baronet , he would be careful how he gave offence by his words , he would be afraid to call it a rebellion , and with shyness would glance even at 794 an insurrection—most gentlemen admitted there had been a riot or a row , many more acknowledged there had been a disputes but , that there had been a difference of opinion every body admitted , upon the grounds of the impossibility of living under the austere control of the King upon the throne , and the tyrannical system of the English constitution , compared with the mild and benignant government of the Chief Consul of France.—in this controversy , as is often the case , from words they came to blows , and he believed it was known , that in about a quarter of an hour some , live and twenty or thirty men were laid dead upon their backs . To the honour of government however , be it said , they had yet made no attempt to prove that any one of these gentlemen had made away with themselves . The hanging which succeeded carried off many more , not more , he begged to observe than the injured laws and justice of the country required ; but the thing went on merrily every day whilst he was on the spot , and he heard it observed , comically enough to be sure ( and in repealing which be hoped he should give offence to no gentleman in that House ) `` that every man had been hanged , except those who deserved it.—It was too late in the night to enter minutely into the several items of the transaction . Enough had already been said . On the 16th of July , the rebel magazine in Patrick Street blew up ; and it appeared by the evidence of Flemming on Emmett 's trial , that all the remaining ammunition , ball cartridges to the amount of 30,000 , arms , & c. were removed in the middle of the duly of the 17th from this rebel magazine to the rebel depot in Marshall Lane.—That at this depot in Marshall Lane , it appears on the trials , that from 10 to 30 persons were constantly employed , not in the manufacturing of manikin pins or pocket pistols , but in the construction of some of the most formidable and cumbersome implements of war.—Beams from 12 to 20 feet in length , ingeniously contrived , and holding from 20 to 25 pikes each other blocks of timber of the same bulk loaded with
