operate . These were the lower orders of journeymen and labourers , especially those who were married , and who with families so circumstanced as to make the burthen either of serving in person , or of providing a substitute , more grievous and least possible for them to support , had yet not the specified number of children which would entitle them to an exemption . There could not be a class of people having more claim to the consideration and protection of the House , or whose rights and interests the House should be more jealous of appearing in any respect to abandon . Of all persons , those whose cause ought to be espoused with most zeal and anxiety , were the helpless and friendless ; though these were , unhappily , the persons , who in the general confusion of human affairs , and with the general infirmity of human nature , which too often lead men to press upon the weak rather than to resist the strong , were the most likely to be neglected and overlooked . It was not always that in public affairs , the greatest injustice was that which was least easy to be committed , or would excite the loudest complaints . Complaint seemed to be among those effects , in the producing which , bodies are found to operate in proportion to their surfaces ; whereas injustice was often greater the more it was confined and condensed , and the more partially it fell ; so that it was commonly easier and safer to do a great injustice to a few , than a smaller one to many . The House , therefore , would , he hoped , be particularly anxious not to leave such a power , could it possibly be avoided , as that which enabled persons , not only to withdraw themselves from a burthen which ought to be common to all , but , what was far worse , to throw the burthen from their play shoulders upon those of others , and thus to double and treble and quintuple the load upon those who were least able to support even their own original share . Against any supposed 986 hardship of withdrawing the exemptions from the volunteers , he hoped the House would not fail to set in opposition , the extreme injustice , towards the classes , which he had mentioned , of continuing them.—Thus far as to the question of good faith , which might be supposed to stand as a plea in bar against any alteration to be made in the volunteer system , as applicable to those who were already engaged in it . Upon the effect which the withdrawing exemptions would have in dissolving the corps , he had already spoken , and would not do more , therefore , than repeat his opinion , that the reduction thus occasioned would very possibly not be greater , and would certainly be far less disadvantageous , than that which would be effected by the joint operation of the liberty of resignation , and the various vexatious regulations now introduced.—But upon the whole of this question of the reduction or disbanding of the Volunteers , he wished to make one observation ; namely , that to disband corps of volunteers was a very different operation , and would have a very different effect , from that of disbanding a part of a regular army . An army disbanded , is dispersed in away not to be reassembled : but not so a corps of volunteers ; which , though nominally dissolved , left all the parts precisely in the same situation in which they were . Not a man would be found removed from the spot on which he had all along been residing ; nor would either his powers or his disposition be changed in any degree , at least in any material degree , from what , they were when he belonged to the corps . Supposing , therefore , that the whole volunteer system were completely dissolved to-morrow ; though a change would be made , no
