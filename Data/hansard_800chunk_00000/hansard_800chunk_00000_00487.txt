the improvement of the internal state of the country , and to keep a jealous and watchful eye over the government in whose hands their lives and property were placed . All these considerations are now blended with the great duties of a general attention to the interests of the empire at large , and I earnestly hope they will equally become subjects of serious and important concern to every gentleman who hears me , and that we shall prove we agreed to the measure of Union , not for the purpose of depriving Ireland of any benefit , but of lending our assistance , and all the abilities possessed by this House , in endeavouring to raise her to an equal share of prosperity with this part of the empire , and to conciliate the minds of the lower orders in that country , that instead of being objects of jealousy to the government , they may , like the people of this country , become a formidable increase to that national force , which we may be called upon to exert against the common enemy.—Another objection is of more recent date . A motion in some respects similar to that which I shall submit , was opposed upon two grounds , the first , that any motion `` not proposed to be followed up by any practical measure , with a view to some beneficial effect , must at all times be liable to great objections . `` —In the present case , it is my intention to move for a Committee of the whole House , to inquire into the conduct of the government of Ireland relative to the insurrection of the 23d July , and the previous conduct of that government , a far as it relates to the said insurrections ; and I have no hesitation in saying , that a beneficial effect must result from this enquiry . If , on the one hand , it should appear that the government of Ireland were active and vigilant , that they had taken every means of procuring correct information , that they had had the ability to discriminate what was true , and what was exaggerated ; if the Lord Lieutenant should appear to have been at his post , prepared , in concert with the Commander of the Forces , to give the necessary orders , anxiously watching over the lives of his Majesty 's subjects entrusted to his care , and placed under his immediate protection—is any man prepared to say , that a beneficial effect will not be derived by removing doubts which are entertained , and very generally too , of the conduct of the I Irish government ? Will no beneficial effect 739 be produced by increasing the confidence of the people of that country in this House ? Yes , Sir , the Irish are a generous and grateful people , the constitution of their country , which has undergone a material change , teaches them now to look up to us for protection , justice , and a redress of grievances . Let them not apply in vain . Let us not consider them as empty words , but consider their substance , and their consequences , and let the Irish nation never have reason to assert , that their interests are neglected , or that justice is denied them by this House.—If , on the other hand , it should appear , that government disregarded all the information given them , despised all advice , had been so ignorant of the real state of the country , as to be incapable of discrimination ; that during their administration no system of police was arranged , with which they kept up a constant communication—if it should appear , that though frequently warned , they were not aware of the extent of the preparations , or inclined to give credit to them—will any man deny , that a beneficial effect will be produced by an immediate application to the throne , to dismiss those under whose very eye an insurrection has been matured , by whose negligence a great
