; for the enemy may be hovering about , apparently for the purpose of invasion , for many months , and perhaps for years , and when this expression of `` appearance of invasion '' was of doubtful construction , and particularly as that construction governed the question , whether so large and efficient a body of men as those of the volunteers , should or should not be put in a situation in which they could best acquire perfect discipline . It was the practice to call out the militia in time of war , and that power was not specifically provided for , but was und ; r the general authority which the crown derived from the same sentence he had already quoted , that of actual invasion or in imminent danger thereof ; that was the authority by which the militia were embodied , and put on permanent duty , as they always were in time of war ; and he wished some principle of this kind to be applied to the volunteers , at least that they might be invited , as many of them had been , to take permanent duty for awhile in certain places , as they had been last year . Ministers then had apparent reason to believe that an invasion was at hand , and , therefore , they invited some volunteers out on permanent duty and pay . They thought that a season in which that was likely . He did not say , that now there was a greater prospect of it , or that this should be made a matter of doubt or question , but he should be sorry that any thing should be neglected , on any account whatever , that could be of use to the volunteer system , for now there 675 was a stronger reason for our being prepared at all points than at any former period , for that now the danger was , in his opinion , more imminent than ever ; and , therefore , he thought it should not be left as an equivocal sentence , as that of appearance of invasion , or imminent danger thereof : in his opinion , in point of policy , the volunteers should not only understand that they may be put on permanent duty now , if in the opinion of the executive government it was fit they should be so , but also that they should understand , that in the opinion of Parliament , they ought to be so for awhile . Whether this event of invasion was to take place in six weeks , or in six months , or eight months , we should be prepared ; and therefore he was of opinion , that they should be assembled , and should march , and be put on pay and permanent duty , where they should agree to do so , for the purpose of their improvement in their military exercise ; and lie would insert in the . bill words for the purpose of giving the crown the power of so calling this force out in any pan it might be thought advisable ; for he could net help thinking there was reason for going to that extent , and then the volunteers would be under precisely the same regulation , as the militia in that respect , although it might not be . necessary to continue them in that state so long : this he thought necessary to be made matter of provision in the bill , not that the crown had not the power already of inviting the volunteers out on pay and permanent duty , but he thought it would be better that the volunteers should understand it to be the . opinion of Parliament , as well as that of the executive government , that they should be so invited.â€”He did not know what the right hon . gent , meant upon the subject of the bounty to be given to volunteers on their being called out , whether this bounty was to be extended to all volunteer corps who should be willing
