be carried to the service of the year . The surplus was reduced by the payments here advanced to 1,370,669 . It was necessary to apprize the Committee that the surplus of 1,766,000 , was not to be considered as a saving in expenditure . It was not to be understood , that the expense was so much less than the sum voted . There was an increase of navy debt to the amount of , 931,352 . The amount being on the 1st Dec. 1802 , 3,105,648 . On the 1st Dec. 1803 , 4,037,000 . This accumulation to the debt , was wholly unavoidable , arising from navy bills not being presented for payment , and the arrears of pay due to seamen on foreign stations , the navy debt must always be increased or diminished . All that was necessary on the part of the Treasury , was to provide the means of satisfying the demands when made , and when the demands were not made , though the Treasury should be full of money , the debt must remain undiminished . This sum of 931,352 must therefore be deducted from,1,776,667 , leaving the real amount of the 956 sum beyond what was necessary for the service of the last year , 845,315 As it was not necessary , however , to keep the means of satisfying such an amount or debt , the greater part of which may not be called for for several years , it was his intention to move the House to have the whole sum of 1,370,669 applied to other services , diminishing per tan to the loan , or other ways and means for the present year . He moved accordingly , that towards raising '' the supply to be granted to his Majesty , there be voted 1,307,614 4s , 8d . from the surplus of the grants for the service of the year 1803. thought it was a fallacy to suppose there was a surplus if gentlemen would look to the last page of the paper where the several sums are made up , no account had been presented this year of the produce of the consolidated fund , there was , therefore , no reason to suppose that the consolidated fund had afforded the surplus of 6,500,000 anticipated from it . On that , however , he laid no stress , as there was no proof one way or the other before the House . But with respect to the war taxes , the produce of which was estimated at 4,500,0001. it was found by an account presented six weeks since , that they had produced something less than 1,900,0001. , leaving a deficiency of 2,600,0001. which would reduce the surplus now proposed to be voted to a deficit of 1,300,0001 . If the 931,0001. added to the navy debt were deducted from the surplus of 1,766,0001. there would remain a sum of above 800,0001. of the grant of last year unapplied , which he thought extraordinary at a time when every exertion should be made in the naval department , and the House was intilled to expect forces equal to the amount of the sum granted . He wished , and he thought it would be more satisfactory to have the amount of the saving in each item particularly stated . The noble lord then adverted to the account of the disposition of the grants for the land service , which stated the number of regular forces at 65,574 effective men . A noble lord ( Castlereagh ) had stated them at near 30,000 more . He wished to know whether the noble lord included in his statement the army of reserve , or what it was that occasioned the difference of the statements . Another item was the grant of 1,500,0001. to enable his Majesty to take such measures as the exigencies of affairs may require . Of the distribution of this sum no satisfactory account was given . He thought it a fallacy after all this , to call on the House to vote a surplus . stated the surplus of the consolidated fund for
