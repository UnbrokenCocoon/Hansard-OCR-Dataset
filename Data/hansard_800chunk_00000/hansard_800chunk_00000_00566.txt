then agreed to , and Mr. Gregor gave notice of his intention to bring forward the other motion on Monday . observed , with respect to accounts laid upon the table , that it would be for the convenience of the House if duplicates from the different offices were presented , in order that members might obtain information upon the subjects of these accounts whilst they were printing . —I now rise , Sir , in pursuance of the notice I gave some time since , to move for certain papers and documents for the purpose of information , and as grounds for further inquiry respecting the war which the King 's government in Ceylon has lately been carrying on in that island . I should not have presumed , Sir , to take upon myself the office of calling the attention of the House to this subject , had it not appeared to me of a very limited nature , and one lying within a very narrow compass , or had I perceived a disposition in any other gentleman to do the same thing . As the subject , however , now , Sir , has been some time before the public , as it appears to me to be one of the greatest importance , as no gentleman has appeared disposed to take it up , and as his Majesty 's ministers have not thought fit to give this House any information respecting it , I have thought it any duty to introduce it to the consideration of Parliament . As the House and the Public are not in possession of any official account of the course or origin of this war , of many of the transactions which took place in the course of it , and of many of its effects and consequences , I will shortly state to the House such leading particulars as , from the information I am in possession of , I believe to be true . I am certain they are mostly true , and where I am incorrect the papers I shall move for will set me right , —From the year 1795 , when we first took the island of Ceylon from the Dutch , to the end of 1802 , our government in Ceylon seems to have pursued its proper objects , to have confined itself to the possession of the coast and open countries of the island , to the introduction of wholesome laws and civilization amongst the natives who live under our government , and every thing , I believe , during the period I have mentioned bore the strongest and most flattering prospect of improvement . We had never apparently , during this period , entertained the dangerous policy of interfering with the unprofitable interior of Ceylon , the woods and mountains , and wild inhabitants of the King of Candy 's dominions . Some time , however , in 1802 , it seems some subjects of the British government had purchased , in Candia , a quantity of the Areka nut , and which , in its way to our settlements , 856 was seized by officers of the Candian government . I have heard that such contracts by Candian subjects are against the laws of that country ; but , be that as it may , our government claimed the property , and it was agreed to be restored , or the value to be paid for it—the value , I believe , was 300 certainly not more , and the first difference between the English and the Candian governments was . whether this sum of £300 should be paid instantly or at the expiration of a few months ; the real cause , therefore , of the war which was about to take place , was the difference between the prompt and protracted payment of 300 it was in this transaction that our national honour was supposed to he involved , for this our government left its useful occupation , and put all the troops in Ceylon in motion to chastise the King of Candy , to invade his dominions , and
