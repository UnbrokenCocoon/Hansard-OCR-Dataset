, that , without fortifications , every defensive system must be extremely imperfect . To execute them on a great scale is , undoubtedly , a work of time ; but , I ask , has any such system been commenced ? —In Ireland , for instance , where the necessity of fortresses has been recognised and pointed out , I believe , by every officer who ever gave an opinion on the subject , I do not understand that government has gone the length of even marking out a single spot of ground for the purpose . With respect to the extent to which it would be advisable to carry the system of fortifications in England , there may be some variety of Opinion ; but there is one subject upon which , if we are really exposed to invasion , no difference of opinion can possibly exist . I mean the propriety of fortifying a great military depot and place of arms ; that is to say , of fortifying it at least to such a degree that it can not be taken without a siege : for , although I go , perhaps , as far as any man , in believing that the enemy may effect the disembarkation of a great force in this country , yet , I am aware , 269 that he will have very great difficulty in landing all the ammunition and military stores that are necessary for a long operation . If , therefore , our military d épóts were secure against a coup de main , the enemy , unable to possess himself of them , would find the difficulties of an invasion infinitely increased , as he would be under the necessity of attempting to form a magazine of his own , and of preserving a communication with it . I must repeat , that if such a council as I have proposed had existed , I do not believe that all these precautions would have been so completely neglected , as they appear to have been.—With respect to the estimates themselves , they appear to be little different from the establishment voted during the last session , and I have , therefore , little to remark , upon them ; but as it is , undoubtedly , of the utmost importance that the regular army should be increased as much as possible , I must again repeat my regret , that the measure which was successfully adopted last war , has not again been resorted to ; I mean that of recruiting from the militia ; for without disparagement to the latter , I may be allowed to say , that the former is a more efficient force . I also regret that the militia of Great Britain and Ireland has not been made interchangeable : a measure which always appeared to me , to be one of the advantages that would naturally result from the union.—There is another species of military arrangement highly deserving of attention ( I know not how far it has been carried ) ; I mean an extensive organization of the unarmed peasantry into corps of pioneers . It is impossible to estimate too highly the benefit which we should derive from their assistance , particularly when we consider , that the face of tins country , covered as it is with enclosures , is of a nature that greatly impedes the action of those two descriptions of force in which we shall be so decidedly superior to an invading enemy , that is to say , cavalry and artillery . The advantage of this superiority we shall be in a great measure deprived of , without the aid of numerous bodies of pioneers to facilitate the operation of these two arms . I should , therefore , be desirous of seeing a great proportion of the peasantry immediately enrolled into corps for this purpose and I should recommend that they should , at the same time , be armed with pikes , the manufacture of which requires very little time or expense , and which they can make use of without any
