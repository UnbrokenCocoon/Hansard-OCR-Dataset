and drummers . The gross force in Great-Britain and Ireland ( exclusive of various other auxiliary means of defence ) amounts to not less than 700,000 men , and with respect to the more regular part of this army , namely , that which is kept constantly in the field , it may be considered as applicable , without any deduction , to meet the enemy , as it will be relieved by the other descriptions of force from those detailed services which in general occasion so serious a deduction from the fighting men of an army , whilst the efficiency of the volunteer corps is such as may fully qualify them , if the occasion should require it , not only to co operate , in their due proportion , with the regular army , 206 but to be brought into the line immediately opposed to the enemy.—I am aware it may be said , that but a proportion of this force is at present armed . Whatever delicacy may usually belong to subjects of this nature , I feel no disposition , and see no reason why I should conceal from the country , in this or in any other respect , its true situation . Of the force in Ireland , consisting of 120,000 men , the whole is armed , and means are provided for arming , without delay , a still greater number of volunteers . Of the 495,000 men at present in Great-Britain , there are armed as follow ? : Army in the field 130,000 , volunteers 220,000 , sea fencibles 25,000–375,000 . Remaining to be armed with muskets 120,000–495,000.—Of the latter , however , a very considerable number are at this moment provisionally armed with pikes , nearly 80,000 having been already issued from the ordnance . It is further to be remarked , that although the distribution of arms has been , in the first instance , directed , so as to complete the corps of the metropolis , and the counties on the coast , there has been issued , at the same time , such a proportion of arms to the corps of the interior , as was deemed sufficient for the purposes of immediate instruction , and arrangements have been made , which will enable the government to arm from the larger depôts of arms still unissued , and which are daily augmenting , whatever proportion of this force it may be found expedient , under any emergency , to assemble for service.—Such is the present state of our army ; that of our navy is not less calculated to inspire confidence , and to ensure the public safety , as far as security can be accomplished by naval means . Without entering into a minute detail of the several classes of ships , of which that navy is at this moment composed , enough lo state to the Committee , that the number of ships of war at present amounts to 469 , and that in aid of the regular navy , and for the purposes of coast defence , an armed flotilla , to the extent of 800 craft of all descriptions , is nearly completed , and further surveys are in progress for extending that number.—It must be gratifying to perceive the voluntary exertions of the country displayed not less strongly in the naval than in the land defence , and although the exertions of other portions of the community , too numerous to admit of specification , are equally to be admired , it is impossible not to allude to the dis- 207 tinguished example which has been given upon the present occasion by the East-India company , and the corporation of the Trinity House : no armed ships have been furnished for the public service by the former , and 10 frigates have been manned by the latter for the defence of the Thames , which , in aid of its other ample naval defences , may be considered as rendering that important part of our frontier , absolutely impenetrable.—When the committee reflect on the naval means which the country at this moment
