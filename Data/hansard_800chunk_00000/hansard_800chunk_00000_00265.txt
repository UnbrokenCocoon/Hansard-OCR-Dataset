of precedents ; there might be , they could be of no force against the meaning of such an act , for that would be to set up the judicial authority of t that House against the authority of an act of parliament , that was allowing one branch of the legislative power to annul the solemn act of the whole.—Now , he said , it was impossible to look at this act of parliament without seeing that there was but one construction to be put upon it . The act of parliament gave the House directions 10 decide whether a petition complaining of an 407 undue election or return should be committed or not , and it stated what such a petition shall contain , and without which the petition should not be sent to a Committee , for it said that no proceeding shall be had on a petition—not that it shall not be decided upon , but that no proceeding can be had on it unless there be said there in , that the persons who complained were persons who claimed a right to vote at the election : and it was impossible to set up the practice of the House against an act of parliament . Looking at the preamble of the bill which governed this case , if was easy to see what was the inconvenience which the act stated it to be the object of the act to avoid , it stated , that frivolous petitions were presented by those who had no right , & c , and to prevent that practice , it was enacted , That no petition shock be proceeded upon , unless the persons presenting it has an interest in the event of the election , it therefore appeared to him to be quite impossible to entertain a petition , which did not state that interest in the petitioners at the Shoe of the election . It was said , that the . House had drawn the party into this difficulty by receiving ; the petition in this session . He did net feel the force of that observation ; as well might it be said that a court of justice had drawn a suitor into a difficulty , by permitting his suit to be . carried on perhaps for twelvemonth , and finally deciding , after objection taken arid argument upon the question , that the case did not come within the jurisdiction of the court . There were individual sacrifices that were indeed to be lamented when they happened , but they must be made for the preservation of the consistency of the law But it appeared to him , that these parties were , not without redress in this case , for there was no act of Parliament which limited the times of presenting an election petition ; there was only a resolution of the House to that effect . It was easy or for the House to get rid of that resolution , as it applied to this case , and to say , that the parties shall have leave now to present another petition , which might be done immediately , conformably to the provisions of the act of Parliament . There was no difficulty for the House to dispense with it 's own resolution in this particular , and so do away at once the hardship of the case—a thing which had been done very often in order to avoid an extreme hardship in other eases , and the House had a right to make its own rules subservient to justice at any time.—That would be removing all doubt . upon the subject ; bur if the Hour 's had no jurisdiction in ibis case to entertain this pention , as he conceived it had not , then it would be 408 in vain to send the petition to a committee , because the committee , which was but an emanation of the House , could not have any authority delegated from the House more than the House possessed , and therefore the decision of the committee could not be binding This would
