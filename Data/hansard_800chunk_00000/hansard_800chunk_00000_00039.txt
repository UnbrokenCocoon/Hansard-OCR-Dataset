Ireland , and that the public tranquillity had suffered no farther interruption ; and I sincerely joined in the hope , that `` such of his deluded subjects as had swerved from their allegiance , had been convinced of their error , and that upon a comparison of the advantages they derive under a free constitution , with the situation of those countries that have fallen under the yoke of the government of France , they will not hesitate to co-operate with his Majesty , in zealously resisting every attack which may be made upon the security and independence of the united kingdom . '' Of this `` fair return to loyalty , '' I could entertain little doubt , were they fully acquainted with the miseries accumulated , on the unfortunate nations who have been forced to wear the galling chains of the republican despot . But I may be suffered , I trust , to hope , that by that passage in his Majesty 's speech , ministers do not mean to hold out an opinion , that because the situation of Ireland may be preferable to that of those countries , pillaged and enslaved by France , that , therefore , it does not require 70 any improvement . What , I would ask , can the minister mean by this comparison ? —Is I it that because Ireland is less oppressed , less persecuted , that , therefore , its inhabitants should be compleatly reconciled to the conduct of the British government , and thoroughly satisfied with their condition ? Is it possible that it can be seriously designed , from a consideration of the difference in degrees of human misery , to decline entering into the investigation of the affairs of re-land ? If such be the purport of this insinuation , it can not be too strongly condemned . Such a mode of reasoning could only be justified on the prepostetous supposition , that nations should be happy and contented , as long as they see others more wretched than themselves ; and it is something new in the history of this country to derive , an argument against any project for ameliorating the condition of its people , from a comparison with the state of other countries , and particularly with such as are subjected to arbitrary government . Would the Irish in 1782 when demanding in the bold tone of freedom , and the irresistible language of reason , the establishment of their rights , have tamely listened to any objection to their claims drawn from a reference to the comparative depression and poverty of their situation but a few years before ? —Would the haughty barons of England , who in the 13th century so nobly con ended for that charter which forms the basis of British liberty , have consented to have withdrawn their pretensions , and abandoned their claims , had they been reminded , that their situation was still preferable to that of the barons of France , and of the other neighbouring states ? No ; they would have indignantly spurned at those , who should have presumed to influence them by such a consideration and have redoubled their energies for the attainment of their objects . But , to refer to a more modern , and a still more glorious epoch of your history , would those illustrious characters of 1688 , who accomplished the ever memorable revolution of that day , which at length clearly ascertained the rights , and irrevocably established the independence and happiness of this realm , would , I ask , an artifice so shallow , a comparison `` o insulting , have induced them to have been false to their country , to themselves , and to you ? If the comparison to which I have alluded , be urged for the purpose of communicating to the people of Ireland , that they have to change in their condition to expect , I can not refrain from declaring that I fear it will be productive of the worst consequence 71 and should be inclined to attribute it to the I
