contained in the Speech which has just now been read , it can not appear out of season for me to congratulate the House on the state of the country as described in that Speech . The spirit , zeal , and unanimity of all classes , and the voluntary exertions of every branch of the community , are unexampled in the annals of any country , and have so effectually provided for the defence and security of the kingdom , as to set all attempts of the enemy to make any impression on our coasts at defiance . I congratulate this House and the nation in general , that the prosperous state of our manufactures , and the great improvement of the public revenue , will enable the government to adhere to that excellent system of carrying on the war without any material addition to ( he permanent debt of the nation ; a system which , if closely pursued , will infallibly disappoint the hopes of our foe , and render abortive every attempt of the enemy to destroy this country by delay , and to keep it in a constant state of alarm.—From the exertions that every where appear around us , I think the country in a situation of the greatest security ; and it is with conscious pride I have observed , that , notwithstanding the extensive and vigorous stem of internal defence that has been adopted , our arms have been carried abroad against the foreign possessions of the enamy . The valuable islands of St. Lucia , Tobago , St. Pierre , and Miquelon , and the settlements of Demarara and Essequibo , have been added to the British empire . The vigilance and wisdom of the administration which planned the expeditions against them , and the zeal , bravery , the forces , by which such va- 14 luable acquisitions have been made , are entitled to the gratitude and acknowledgments of the country . In the short space of four months such advantages have been gained , as , in every former war , would have been reckoned glorious achievements for a whole campaign.—It is with the highest satisfaction I learn , that a convention has been concluded with Sweden , founded on the firmest basis of all treaties , the reciprocal advantage of both the contracting parties.—It is also matter of satisfaction and congratulation to know , that the affairs of Ireland now appear to wear a favourable aspect , and that the change has been brought about , without the necessity of employing those extraordinary means , which the difficulties of the times render it indispensably necessary to place in the hands of the Irish government . Such conduct must necessarily impress the deluded insurgents of that country , with a just sense of the blessings of the happy constitution , which it was the object of their wishes to destroy . The impartiality and regard to public justice , with which the several trials of the persons engaged in the rebellion , have been conducted , reflects the highest honour on those to whom the administration of the affairs of Ireland have been committed , and entitles them to the respect and gratitude of the country . His Majesty has expressed his hope , that such of his deluded subjects as have swerved from their allegiance are now convinced of their error , and that having compared the advantages they derive from the protection of a free constitution , with the condition of those countries which are under the dominion of the French government , they will cordially and zealously con-I cur in resisting any attempt that may be I made against the security and independence of the United Kingdom . If after such a comparison , any man can be backward or lukewarm in the cause of his country , let him call to his recollection the example of his Majesty , whose whole life ha ; been devoted to the improvement and advantage of his subjects , and who has this day come forward and declared to his people his determination , to share with them
