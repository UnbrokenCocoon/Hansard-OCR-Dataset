of the other , as it was capable of animating.—I shall not here enter into the examination of the means which were or might have been used to raise men ; but shall consider only the use that has been made of them when raised : which has , in my opinion , been extremely erroneous.—The first thing that ought to have been done was to augment every one of the existing regiments to as great a number of men as they could contain without becoming unmanageable ; both because recruits engrafted upon an old regiment will much sooner become fit for service than if formed into new corps ; and also , because in the former case they will soon be inspired , not only with the general spirit of the army , but also with that particular pride and esprit de corps which exists in each old regiment , and is founded upon the recollection of is former services.—And when I compare the establishment of officers in our regiments with that of any other army in Europe , I think I have good reason for saying , that wish a small increase of those below the rank of field officers , the regiments might have been augmented to 12 or 140O men each , and that with some interior arrangements , which it is unnecessary to enter into here , they would not have been unwieldy.—Had ministers pursued this system in the augmentation of the army , instead of raising thirty six new battalions , the new levies might soon have been made equal to 582 the old stock , and we should still have had a great number of good officers remaining to he employed in forming the Reserve , which I shall presently mention , as well as in instructing the Irregulars.—I now , Sir , come to mention a description of force for which no provision whatever has been made , I mean a real Reserve , destined to join the regiment in the event of actual invasion ; by means of which the losses sustained in the first actions would be immediately repaired , and the strength of the army would I be constantly increasing , or at least main ; undiminished , even during the course of the most severe operations , —The Reserve which I have in contemplation might have been formed in such a manner as to interfere very little indeed with the ordinary avocations of the people , and could not reasonably have been considered as a hardship in any point of view.—I would have taken this reserve , by ballot , from amongst the first class , that is , from those who from age and other circumstances are fittest for the military service ; officers from hall-pay should have been distributed through the country to instruct them ; and that instruction should have been confined to the rendering them expert in loading and firing , and teaching them the very little else that is absolutely necessary to enable them to take their places in the rear ranks of the regiments when called into the field.—If the army had been augmented on the principles I have mentioned , and no more officers than were ready necessary had been employed in forming the reserve , there would still have remained in the country , as applicable to the irregulars , a considerable number of men of some military experience ; and without the aid of such men , I think it impossible that , they should ever be able to render the services that they would otherwise be capable of.—I now , Sir , come to consider that part of our present force to which this bill immediately relates ; and I must say , that the whole system of the volunteer establishment , as it now exists , appears to me to be fundamentally wrong . The manner in which it is constituted , the mode in which the expense is defrayed , the committees , the exemptions , the mode of training this force , and the use : which is intended to be made of it ,
