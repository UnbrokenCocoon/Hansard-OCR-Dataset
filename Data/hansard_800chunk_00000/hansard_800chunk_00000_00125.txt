own shores was most likely to take place ; and when the ports of Holland are locked by the season , there seems to be less probability of the attempt of invasion being made upon England for some months . We should not , however , act as if the danger were wholly blown over , and the attempt wholly abandoned . We should in this interval diligently apply ourselves to complete our means of defence , so that in the spring we may command every speices of security , which the resources of the country are calculated to afford . If it be the opinion of the House , that officers should be assigned to the different volunteer battalions , the sooner it is done the better , that they may have time to form acquaintance with 195 the officers with whom they would have to act , and the men they would have to command , before the season for military operation returns I should wish , therefore , that even this night , at least before the recess , the House should pass a vote for carrying this object into effect , I am the more urgent for this , because it appears to be the only object connected with the Estimates that rails for oar immediate attention . Other points may be reserved for future discussion , but if Parliament separates without making provision for the expenses which the objects I have pointed out will require , there will be no opportunity of making up for the time which must thus be lost in carrying the plan into execution.â€”But even in addition to this improvement on the volunteer system , it will necessary , in order to give it due effect , that it should be accompanied with some new regulations of detail , the purpose of which will be to keep up the number of the volunteers to their full amount , to ensure punctuality of attendance , to promote steadiness , attention , and soldierly habits , and , though without putting the corps under martial law , provide for that obedience and discipline requisite to form the military character . Looking forward , as I am afraid we must , to the long duration of the present contest , it is of the utmost importance to prepare a system of defence , which will be commensurate to the necessity of our situation , and adequate to every purpose , both of defensive and offensive war . We have already seen what exertions , what sacrifices , the people of this country are ready to make , tinder the guidance of parliament , under the impulse of zeal for its honour and independence , under a sense of the danger wish which the are threatened . This zeal and this spirit , prompting such generous and unanimous efforts , may perhaps induce the enemy to abandon the project which he has presumptuously conceived and rashly proclaimed perhaps , after viewing us on every side after reconnoitring our position , he may be forced virtually to admit that we are unassailable . Perhaps , he may apparently abandon his designs ; but we must not suffer ourselves to be lulled into a fatal security . We must not relax our efforts , or intermit Oar preparations , while any measure of wise precaution remains to be adopted . We must take care that the enemy shall not do , by surprize , what he finds he can not do when he has given us warning . Indeed we are not to expect that after the force of the country has been let down , the enemy will always be so confident and so indiscreet as to give us ten months previous notice of the attack 196 which he meditates . If , upon the apparent abandonment of the project of invasion , the people of this country were to indulge themselves in congratulation on their escape , there is some danger that the spirit which has I proved our safety would subside , and these efforts be relaxed . The volunteer system might thus moulder
