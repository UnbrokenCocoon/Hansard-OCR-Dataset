. gent . ( Mr. Pitt ) who lately announced an intention of doing so.—I have heard , for instance , from such authority as leaves me no doubt of the fact , that on a part of the coast which is perhaps more than any other exposed to the attack of the enemy 's flotilla , many vessels perfectly calculated for opposing such a force , well manned and belonging to persons extremely willing to prepare them for that service , did not receive their guns till some time after Christmas . And as this happened in a situation than which none perhaps is more favourable for the enemy 's purpose ! it may be doubted whether in other places we are even now prepared as we ought to be.—Having said these few words respecting the navy , because the subject had been introduced by others in discussing this measure , I shall now proceed to consider the system of our land force ; and although I shall chiefly direct my attention to that part of it to which this bill more immediately relates , yet I shall think it right to make a few observations respecting the other branches of the service.—And here , Sir , it will be necessary to consider the means which the ministers possessed at the commencement of the war.—This House gave repeated proofs not only of its willingness but anxiety to furnish them with ail the pecuniary means , and invest them with all the powers of every kind which might enable them to call forth the strength of the country , and the whole body of the people when called upon , displayed an unexampled degree of patriotism and zeal : in short , all the means possessed by this country were completely at their disposal . Now let us see how they have applied these means in the different branches of the military service.—In the first place , with respect to the army , we had , Sir , when the war broke out , an army not so strong as it ought to have been in point of numbers , but strong , indeed , in all those excellent qualities which constitute the very soul of an army . It was strong , I say , in a truly military spirit , in an excellent and firmly established discipline , in considerable experience acquired in the course of the war , and above all , Sir , it was strong in a consciousness of its prowess , so recently evinced in the glorious exploits which a part of it had achieved on the plains of Egypt.—I may speak my opinion of that campaign the more freely , because I had no share in it ; 581 and when I consider all the difficulties that our troops had to contend with , I do sincerely think , that in the whole course of the late war , in which so many brilliant actions were performed by nil the armies that were engaged in it , nothing was done either by the French or allies equal to the achievements of the English in Egypt.—The happy effect which these victories naturally produced on the minds of the army . was not confined to those brave men by whom they were gained . Every British soldier sympathized with them ; every regiment in the service felt an increased confidence in its powers ; and when marching against the enemy would be electrified by the sound of Alexandria With such an army on the one hand , ( not , indeed , so numerous as it ought to have been , but equal to any in Europe in all those incorporeal excellencies which constitute the soul of an army ) and with a great population on the other , ( brave as oar countrymen have always shewn themselves , but glowing , upon this occasion , with a more than ordinary degree of patriotic zeal ) it is obvious that all the measures of the government ought to have been so calculated as to infuse the spirit of the one , into as large amass
