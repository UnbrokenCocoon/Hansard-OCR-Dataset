subject , he would say it was common sense , that a greater number of volunteers should be permitted in Kent , Sussex , and other maritime counties , to what was allowed in Nottingham or Northamptonshire . So 1033 inconsistently and unwisely had ministers acted upon this subject , that it was altogether incongruous and absurd to apply the word system to such an ill-understood and undigested mass of regulations as related to the volunteers . observed , the question now before their Lordships was , that this bill be read a second time : he , said that he could not help observing , there had been great irregularity in this debate , by almost entirely departing from the question , He assured their Lordships that he should not take up much of their time . He was too far advanced in life to have any object in speaking , but from public duty . He would not waste time in complimenting ministers on the wisdom of their measures , having very little acquaintance with any of them , except from official correspondence , and he did not even know who were their opposers : he rose as an old volunteer , feeling it his indispensible duty to do justice to that species of force , which upon every occasion had acted with honour and spirit . He said he could not but regret , that many reflections had been thrown out in speeches and in publications against the volunteer system , ( which term he should use , notwithstanding it had been disapproved of by a noble Lord ) , some from ignorance and folly , and others , he was afraid , from worse principles . His Lordship was confident , that the most malicious insinuations would not raise a jealousy between the volunteers and regular army ; it was their joint honour and interest to support each other .

He was happy to have this opportunity of complimenting a noble and learned Lord on a decision which has done him great honour , and given universal satisfaction . At the same time , with all the attachment which his Lordship said he had to the volunteer system , he could never agree to allow the men the power of choosing their own officers ; he had heard of the existence of such a practice , but in the part of the country he was connected with , it had never been heard or thought of . No practice appeared to him to be more dangerous . His Lordship coincided perfectly in the sentiments so ably stated by a reverend prelate , which it was unnecessary , for him to repeat . He concluded by saying , that there were many clauses in the bill before the House , which he highly approved of , and therefore gave it ids entire support . took a similar view of the subject , and would answer , when
