chief had not neglected the necessary precautions for the security of I Dublin.—It now remains to be seen how & these precautions operated . When the at tuck broke out , it appeared that two small I parties were sufficient , completely to disperse the rebels , even before any other parties could march to their assistance . As soon as the insurrection was known , parties marched from the royal barracks , and I now hold in my hand an official report of general Dunn , who commanded the garrison in the barracks , that night , by which it appeared that between 10 and 11 o'clock , the following parties marched from the barrack , viz . 100 foot and 50 horse , to the lord lieutenant 's , in the park ; 50 men at the bank ; 3 parties of 100 men each , besides some smaller ones , were sent in different directions ; in all 470 foot , and 50 horse were sent from the barracks , and there remained besides 600 I rank and rile . There is not , therefore , the slightest presumption for imputing any negligence to the commander in chief in fact the precautions used , when compared with the danger , may almost appear more than was necessary . It is the death of Lord Kilwarden and Col. Brown , that gives a degree of importance to this transaction which does not really belong to it ; for when it came to be examined in a court of justice , it appeared to be a most contemptible effort of a 751 wild and extravagant young man , and had more discouraged the rebels and brought the cause of rebellion into more contempt than any event that had ever occurred ; and this was Mr. Emmett 's notable receipt for overturning the government of Ireland & I am not , however , surprised that the public mind of that country should be a little disposed to criticise upon the transaction ; for though the government was not surprised , I yet beyond all doubt , the public feeling of the country was surprised at this most extraordinary attempt ; as it occurred at a time when it was remarkably dark , and in a country where the people are peculiarly alive to such matters , that there is no transaction examined after it is over , there is no battle criticised after it is fought , in which some error might not be found.—One of the charges against the lord lieut . is that he had not given written orders to the commander in chief ; this is a charge which I am sure the commander himself would not make , because it is a thing not usually practised , It is true , that in one instance , written orders were sent to Gen. Lake , when he commanded in the north of Ireland , but that was under particular circumstances , and could not be necessary where the commander and the lord lieut had the means of verbal communication together . It has been urged that patroles ought to have been sent out ; but if such extraordinary measures of precaution had been adopted as would have induced the rebels to lay aside their design , the consequence would be , that government would have been the laughing-stock of the country , for they would not have believed that any danger existed . Besides , in that case , how could the government of Ireland , under these circumstances , have applied for any extraordinary power to parliament They could not have laid such a case before parliament as would have justified ministers in proposing , or parliament in granting these powers.—Another criticism which has been made upon the conduct of the Irish government was , that they did not call out the yeomanry ; but certainly that would have been a most humiliating display of alarm , when the garrison was completely sufficient for the defence of the town.—Another criticism is , that the lord-mayor was not apprised of the danger ; but contend that this
