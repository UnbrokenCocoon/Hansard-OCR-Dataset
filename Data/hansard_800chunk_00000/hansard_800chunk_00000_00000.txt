then rose to move an Address lo his Majesty , on his most gracious Speech from the throne , which their Lordships had just heard read , and spoke as follows : My Lords—In calling your Lordships ' attention to the speech which has been delivered from the throne , I trust I shall not be considered as arrogating to myself an extraordinary claim to your consideration . Little in the habit of addressing you on such occasions , and not , perhaps , suited to it on any , I shall require much of your indulgence , while I endeavour to express those sentiments to which that speech has given rise ; though I am persuaded I feel them only in common with your Lordships , and with all those who have had the opportunity of attending to it . The importance of perfect unanimity at this moment , I feel most strongly , and I trust nothing will fall from me to stand in the way of that most desirable object . We must recollect that we have to contend with an overbearing and vindictive enemy , avowing , as his object , our destruction , and one who we know , by the melancholy experience of Europe , will stop at no means to effect his purposes . If ever there was a period of more importance in the annals of history than another , this is the period . If ever there was a moment for peculiar pride in the name of Briton , more than another , it is at the present moment . If ever there was a period when this nation , long the envy and admiration of the world , could more properly be looked up to for imitation , it is now , when every individual , born to the protection of equal laws , stands forward , without distinction of rank , class , or situation , to shed his blood in defence of that invaluable inheritance . The measures which the prudence of his Majesty 's ministers has suggested for the defence of the empire , and which the wisdom of Parliament has adopted , have been outdone by the zeal and patriotism of its inhabitants , and Great-Britain offers itself to the admiration of the world in a novel attitude , a nation of soldiers , not brought together by the terrors of revolutionary laws , not assembled by the unbridled power of a despotic government , not invited by the hopes of plunder , from the destruction of neighbouring nations , but voluntarily stepping forth on the noblest and wisest principles , the possession of an unequalled form of government , a proper sense of its value , and a determination to die in its defence.—France , assisted in her views upon other 5 nations , by their internal dissent ions , may have the same expectation here , but she will find , that , however the wisest may differ in political opinions , or however we may be divided in another part of the United Empire by distinctions of religion , there are points and principles in which we shall be actuated by one mind ; we will not be invaded by a foreign enemy ; we will not be dictated to by any one ; we will live as an independent people , as our forefathers have done , or we will not live at all.—But , though much of the attention of the King 's ministers must have been bestowed on our extensive preparations for home defence , their labours have not been confined to that only . Enterprizes for conquests abroad have been planned , and several colonies of considerable commercial value wrested from the enemy and added to the dominions of Great-Britain , opening new markets for our manufactures , and , at the same time , cutting off the last remnant of foreign trade from France . She is effectually deprived of the means for the restoration of her naval power , the remnant of which , still smarting under the recollection of former defeats , confined to her own
