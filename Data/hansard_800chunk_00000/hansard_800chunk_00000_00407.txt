, yet it is undoubtedly necessary to except measures to guard against that long , protracted , and lingering danger with which the enemy may threaten us . Because , the effect of deterring the enemy from making his attempt , by a demonstration of the force and spirit of the country , may have the effect of making us relax in our efforts , which might produce the most disastrous consequences , I therefore , think we 622 should act wrong indeed , if we were to satisfy ourselves with merely providing against the present danger , without adopting some great , general , and permanent system , equal , not only to the present danger , but equal to that danger which may continue to threaten U3 , and which may not be terminated by the present war . I hope , indeed , that our danger will terminate with the present war , because I hope , we shall not lightly consent to make peace without the attainment of security for the future , a security which can not be obtained while France remains in her present situation . I do not allude to any particular form of government which may prevail in that country , but while she remains as she is , the arbitress of the continent of Europe a perfectly military country , under the guidance of the most absolute and unlimited government , that perhaps , ever existed ; unshackled by any of those checks that operate upon other governments , unshackled by that check which has operated in every other instance , though , perhaps , unseen in even the most arbitrary states—I mean , the influence of public opinion , which has never yet been stifled in any other country but in France : and which has always operated more or less ' even in the most servile forms of government that ever disgraced Europe . In France however , this check of public opinion is now so destroyed , that no man dares hardly , even in thought , question the conduct of the government , however it may squander The treasures of their country , or , however may lavish the blood of the people . The system in that country is different from any that ever existed before , and must be met by corresponding exertions on our part and however painful those exertions may be * we must determine to submit to them , as the lot which is inseparable from those days in which if has pleased Providence to cast our existence.—With regard to the present volunteer system , though I am far from thinking that it has reached any thing like perfection ; though , I think it is capable of , and I have no doubt , will receive grC3t improvement ; yet , still I do think , the principles on which it is founded are perfectly right ; and , I have no doubt , that coupled with other regulations , and these not very difficult ones , it may be rendered a permanent security against future danger . It is no disparagement to the spirit of the volunteers or their devotion to their country , to say , that it is impossible to trust continually to the operation of that volunteer spirit , k is no disparagement to the spirit of the 'people , to bay , that when the immediate danger is passed , they may , however erroneously , 623 doubt the necessity of their future exertions . The volunteer system was founded upon the conviction of immediate danger ; if that cause should cease , it is not at all extraordinary that the effect should cease also . If that is the case , it becomes the duty of Parliament to do that for the country which spontaneous zeal can not do That spontaneous zeal has hitherto superseded almost the necessity of legislative measures , and has counteracted no small share of error on the part of the executive government . It certainly can not , however , be expected to continue for any great length of time
