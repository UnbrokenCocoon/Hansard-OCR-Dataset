militia to Ireland in I ? OS , but he could not help being a little surprised that the right hon . gent , who was so eager for the measure then , should now oppose one which was founded on the same same principle . It would certainly , however , be necessary to give forces of some sort in place of these 10,000 men , and he saw no description of force that could so well answer the purpose , as those very men that were to be taken away . He would therefore vote for the amendment . explained , by observing that he had never been very eager on the subject , and if he had , it would not have been inconsistent with his present conduct , as the times were materially different . opposed the amendment ; and in answer to what had fallen from a right hon . gent . ( Mr. Windham ) , in asserting that he was not an eager and warm supporter of the measure in the last war , for enabling his Majesty to accept the offers of several regiments of the Eritish militia to serve in Ireland ; and 1094 that , so far from eagerly supporting that measure , he had said nothing on the occasion ; he could not but exceedingly regret that the right hon . gent , had on that occasion , sat silent , instead of speaking those objections to the constitutionality of the measure which he had offered this night . His very silence on the former occasion was a proof of his approbation of it then ; for if he entertained those opinions on the former occasion , which he had expressed on the present , then had he acted very inconsistently with his duty as a member of parliament ; and after being silent upon the first introduction of such a measure , it ill became him to express those objections now . But , whatever disposition the House might feel to indulge the right hon . gent , with a delay of this measure , it should not be forgotten that a prompt respect was due to the gallant and patriotic ardour of the Irish militia ; for what must they think , on being told that the services which they so gallantly offered could not be accepted without a breach of faith with them ? His hon . friend who had last sat down who opposed the measure , did not seem to observe , that in approving the ardour of the Irish militia on this occasion , and promising to take into their consideration his Majesty 's recommendation , the wording of the proposed address was extremely guarded , and only proposed to enable his Majesty to a certain limited extent to accept their services ; but surely it was not fitting that , during the whole period of the approaching recess , those gallant militia regiments , and the govt . of Ireland , through whom their offer came , should remain in suspense and uncertainty on this subject , and be left in doubt whether or not the parliament would enable his Majesty to accept their loyal and spirited offer.â€”As to the idea that there could be any intention suddenly to strip Ireland of 10,000 men , nothing could be more erroneous . The object winch govt . had in view was that so often desired by those gent , who now opposed this measure ; namely , to set at liberty a dispose able force of 10,000 men for of delusive operations . It was not intended suddenly to withdraw the whole of the 10,000 from that country ; but 5000 brought hither , would set at liberty as many troops of the line from the establishment of this country , and those might be replaced by 3000 of another species of force to Ireland , winch would set at liberty 5000 troops of the line there 1095 too . But it was by no means the intention to diminish the strength of Ireland . It had been objected , that the measure
