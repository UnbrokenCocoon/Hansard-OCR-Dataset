this respect I differ from a right hon . gent . ( Mr. Pitt ) whose talents and eloquence must always give great weight to his opinions ; yet , upon a subject so immediately connected with my own profession , I can not give up my judgment to his ; and I maintain , that the regular system of tactics , according to which the volunteers are now trained , is not only not better than that simple , natural , and easy method which I would teach , but that it really is a great deal worse . It is worse , I say , not merely because it requires much more time to learn it ( and with the volunteers every hour that they are taken from their ordinary occupations should be considered of importance ) but also because , when learnt , it is totally unlike any thing they will have to do in presence of the enemy.—I am sure it is not from prejudice that I reject it , I was formerly one of the most zealous advocates ; and in a regiment which I commanded for five or six years in India , I practised it with success before it had been adopted in the rest of the army . We took it from the great King of Prussia , by whom it was introduced and brought to perfection . It was admirably calculated for the nature of he country where his armies had to act ; which , consisting of extensive plains , made it necessary that large bodies of troops should be able to make great combined movements with perfect regularity and order . But the same general principle , which induced him to adopt this system , should make us reject it ( I mean the principle of adapting your tactics to the ground you are to act upon ) for the two countries 590 are totally different.—If we could suppose England reduced to that unfortunate state of being absolutely precluded from ever carrying on offensive war , in that case I should say , that we ought not to adopt the Prussian system , even for the infantry of the line : but as the latter are exposed to serve in all countries , it is necessary they should know both methods ; and on the plains of Egypt they certainly experienced the advantages of this solid regular system.—I do not , therefore , say that it should be wholly exploded in the regular army ; but I can conceive no earthly reason for applying it to a body of men , who are never to act out of this country , and who in Lt ought never to be used as regular troops.—The volunteers ( who can not know any fixing of war ) naturally expect , that what they are taught upon the field of exercise is like what they are to do upon the field of battle ; and in proportion as they become expert in the one , they naturally acquire confidence in their fitness for the other . But what will be the effect produced on their minds , when the first time they see the enemy , they discover that what they have been learning is wholly impracticable , and that the confidence they had acquired in their own proficiency is ill founded ? Is it not natural , I say , that this disappointement should be productive of mischievous consequences ? Whether this system of tactics be practicable or not in such a country as our , is a question which many gentlemen now present are perfectly competent to decide ; because there are very-many of them who have applied themselves to the duties of volunteer officers in a manner that does them the highest credit.—Now I will ask any volunteer officer , any regular officer , or any other man who will reject pedantry and allow common sense to operate upon his mind ; I say , I will ask him to put in his pocket the book containing an extract of general Dundas 's System as now practised : by the
