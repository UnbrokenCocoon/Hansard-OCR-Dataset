ravages of a cruel disease from the rest of my family ; '' and in the same manner should I be inclined to address the gentlemen of this House , `` no more of the 129 severity of this measure , of which happily for you , you can not judge of the necessity by a reference to any thing which passes here . No more of the useless detail of the outrages and atrocities which have lately disgraced that unhappy country ; for her crimes and her sufferings she has much to mourn ; but the past can not be recalled : in the name of mercy then , save her from again plunging into the guilt of rebellion , and incurring its heavy penalties . `` —I perfectly agree with those who consider the re-enactment of the present bills as a most extraordinary exertion of legislative power ; such a one , as in the judgment of a Briton may almost appear unconstitutional ; but , Sir , the hon . gent . ( Mr. Wilberforce ) under the gallery , has given the true reason , why a measure , which in this country would be exclaimed against as most severe , becomes unfortunately necessary for Ireland ; namely , that its state is not like that of England : no , Sir , there exists between the conditions of the two countries a melancholy dissimilitude , and it is only because I fear that the sad necessity exists for thus strengthening the hands of the executive in that country , that I am induced to give my consent to the passing of the bills before the House ; I do so in the hope , however , in the sanguine expectation , that the wisdom and justice of the United Parliament towards Ireland , will , at length , confer upon her those blessings to which she anxiously , and I must be allowed to add , justly looks ; and that , by devising for her a system of extensive and harmonized polity , such as will ensure for the future the happiness and tranquillity of that people , a recurrence to such measures as these before us , will be rendered unnecessary at any future period.—I will not rake up the ashes of the dead , for the purpose of accusing your ancestors of cruelty and impolicy in the system they had adopted towards Ireland ; I am ready with my countrymen to forget cur sufferings , and to forgive our oppressors ; and I do most solemnly declare , that in looking wistfully to the future , I have no object but the prosperity of my country , and the consolidated strength of the empire.—The proper subject for the consideration of Parliament is speedily to inquire as to what ought to be done to ameliorate the situation of Ireland . It has been observed during the debate , that `` an improvement had taken place in the public mind , and that a better disposition was rapidly growing up there ; '' but I caution gentlemen not to allow themselves to be deceived as to the nature of that disposition : true , indeed ; it was an increasing and im- 130 proving dispotition as against Buonapartéé and his accursed satellites ; but it did not , therefore , incline the more favourably to wards a system truly vicious and defective , and approved by no honest , thinking man . The inhabitants of Ireland , when by the Union they joined their fate with that of Britain , were , indeed , taught to anticipate the blessings , as a noble lord ( Castlereagh ) has justly observed , which would result front such a connexion ; but I positively deny , that in these their expectations , they have been satisfied : on the contrary , they have not advanced one step towards their accomplishment ; it would , therefore , be preposterous to suppose , and most wicked to attempt to induce the House to believe , that there was a growing disposition of content and satisfaction , when there
