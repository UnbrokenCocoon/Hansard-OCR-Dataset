House , by going into a committee on the bill , might have an opportunity of reconsidering this measure , and he believed that it was the desire of that part of the country , through which it was proposed the canal should pass , that the bill might meet with a fair discussion ; nor could the House come to a proper decision without hearing counsel , if required ; and the examination of evidence both for and against the measure . said , that he rose to declare , as president of Christ 's hospital , that the property of that charitable institution would be materially injured were this bill to pass . He should , therefore , vote for the amendment.—The motion for the bill 's being read a second time this day six months , being put and carried , it was consequently I thrown out for this session . —Sir ; I as I hare reason to believe that a part , and I must confess a very important part , of the information which it is my wish the House should be in possesion of , with respect to the state and means of our naval defence , is not likely to meet with any opposition of the part of his Majesty 's ministers , I shall not detain the time of the House with an details or observations which do not apply , I as closely as possible , to the papers that constitute the object of my inquiry . I shall , therefore , state generally the grounds and ends of the different motions I have to bring forward ; but I beg leave to add , that if they are , as it will appear to nee , unexpectedly objected to , I shall claim the indulgence of the House , in explaining more fully , and calling their attention to the importance of the information in detail , which I conceive essentially necessary to the safety of the country.—The object of the first motion I shall have the honour of making , will be , an humble address to his Majesty , 875 `` That he may be pleased to give directions to have laid before the House , an account of I the number of ships of the line , ships of 50 guns , frigates , sloops of war , bombs , hired armed vessels , & c. in commission on the 31st of December 1793 , on the 30 : hof September 1801 , and on the 31st of Dec. 1803 , specifying the service , in which they were respectively employed . '' Gentlemen will perceive that this motion calls for the production of papers , distinguishing what is absolutely necessary for their information , the state of three different periods in which the naval means of the country 's defence were called into action . When the question 33 properly considered , witch respect to the necessity of making great preparations , in order to meet with vigour and efficacy those carrying on by the enemy , and openly avowed to be intended against he existence of this nation , I believe it will be found , that the number of that description of our naval force , tit to repel the actual attempts of the enemy , is at the present moment much inferior and less adequate to the exigency of the danger , than at any period in former times . Shall I , Sir , detain the House with a tedious recital of the great and extraordinary changes which have taken place , and which call for increased activity and exertion ? Such an appeal is rendered unnecessary by the actual state of things , and by facts which can not be controverted.—If , on former occasions we have been called upon to make preparations of defence in their magnitude superior to preceding cases , it does not require from me any arguments to convince the House , that in our present situation our means of security should be much greater in a comparative point of view , and that in proportion
