difference in the estimate for the two countries , which was unavoidably to be calculated in proportion to the time the volunteers should be called out on actual service . He supposed that the whole of the Irish volunteers would be out four months in the year.â€”But though the allowance under this head would be larger than the estimate for English corps , he thought , it right to state , that , except in case of invasion , when they should necessarily be employed on actual service , the Irish volunteers received no pay when merely out for exercising , nor when on duty , unless the men should be actually and efficiently present at muster on their parade . He had stated the present volunteer force of Ireland to be 70,000 . The estimate , however , had been made , on a supposition that the number could , and would be considerably increased ; and he had stated enough , he thought , to shew that the calculation was not excessive . He had now stated all additions proposed to be made to the estimates of last year . He had yet to observe , that there was no estimate respecting a part of the military establishment , which it had been usual to include in the Army Estimates he meant the foreign corps employed in the service of this country , some of which had already been provided for ; and others were now raising in different pans of Europe . The Horse , he trusted , would excuse him for not stating precisely the amount of the expence of this branch of the service , from the uncertainty of the extent to which it might be carried , and good policy would dictate the carrying it as far as circumstances would allow . Though he could not now lay before the committee the account , he should certainly do so after the recess , and particularly as his Majesty would have to resort to Parliament for the exercise of his prerogative . There was another branch of die military establishment which was usually submitted amongst the other estimates ; he bad it not in his power to lay before the committee in the present instance , and which he was the more induced to advert to 162 from the question which had been put to him on the subject , on a former night by an hon . Admiral , he alluded to the Barrack department . This department had been unavoidably , from the nature of the situation of the country , carried to a much greater extent than on any former occasion . The expence , however , was not so much incurred for regular barracks , as in providing winter cantonments for the forces on the coast . It was impossible yet to procure such returns as would enable him to lay an accurate estimate before the House , and he was convinced , that the expence would not be deemed improperly incurred , when the House would be aware , that the whole effective force of the country was at present covered by barracks . He should use all possible diligence in making out the account , and though he was not competent at present to bring it forward , he was prepared to give any gentleman who might be desirous of information on the subject , every satisfaction in his power , either with respect to the department itself , or to the contracts which had been entered into respecting it , or any other point to which enquiry might be directed . He should be sorry that forms should preclude any gentleman from seeking information , and he would be happy to communicate any in his power . He had now stated the grounds upon which he should move a vote of the Estimates , which was a subject intimately connected with the most important interests of the empire . He trusted the House would be sensible of the advantage of improving , by every possible means , the disposition which prevailed in the country . Not only the
