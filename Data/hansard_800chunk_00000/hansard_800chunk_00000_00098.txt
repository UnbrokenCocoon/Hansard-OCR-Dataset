The first item , therefore , to which he felt it his duly to call the attention of the Committee , related to the force proposed to be voted for guards 159 and garrisons in the United Kingdom . It would be in the recollection of the House , that the number voted for that service last session , partly in an early part of it , and partly in the month of June , amounted in the whole to 108,901 men . The force now proposed to be voted for that service amounted to 167,669 , between which , and the number voted last year , the Committee would perceive there was a difference of 53,768 . But the major part of that difference would be made up by the army of reserve , which amounted to 39,467 men . This force was distributed either in augmentation of the old battalions , or in forming eighteen second battalions of 1000 men each , or in sixteen battalions of reserve , consisting of about 750 each . This statement would be sufficient to give the Committee a clear idea of the augmentation , which was proposed to be made to the regular military establishment The Life Guards were to be augmented by 12,456 , the twenty-four Regiments of Dragoons were to be augmented by a proportion , which , in the whole , would amount to 4272 men ; and the sixteen Regiments of Foot Guards were to have an augmentation , net exceeding 2000 men in the whole , making an augmentation of about eighteen thousand . This was the only addition that was proposed to be now made to the regular army , with the exception of a small addition of 320 or 230 men to some of the old regiments of the line , and an inconsiderable addition that was to be made to some garrison battalions and fencible regiments , which would not in the whole amount to any material augmentation.—The next head to which it was his duty to call the attention of the Committee , was certainly a large one , he meant the general staff establishment . But when the situation of the country and the circumstances of the essential services rendered by that department , were considered , he trusted ii would not appear excessive . The sum at which this service was estimated , was 154,647 1. a sum though large , not extravagant , when it was recollected , that so many brigade officers were found necessary to train the volunteer force of the , country
