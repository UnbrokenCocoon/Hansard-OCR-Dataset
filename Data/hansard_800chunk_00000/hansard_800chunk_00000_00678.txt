present bill to render as efficient as the nature of such a body , and the principles of its institution , can reasonably admit : and before I enter upon the details of those other measures of defence , which the govt , has provided , I trust , my Lords , that I may be allowed to make a short observation on the exercise of a right , which I have ever understood to be inherent in the person vested with the executive power of the state—I mean that prerogative residing in the Crown , of calling forth the services of all capable persons in the country , upon actual invasion , or strong apprehension of it . This right , my Lords , I conceive to be one of the indefeasible prerogatives of the King of this kingdom ; not a prerogative of recent growth , but discoverable in every part of our history : and I own , that it was with much astonishment I heard it controverted 1023 on a former evening , by a noble earl on an opposite bench . I should Lope , my lords , that there is not a person in the empire , tolerably acquainted with the constitution , who can entertain a doubt that the principle contained in the preamble of the present bill namely , that it is the undoubted right of his Majesty to require the services upon certain emergencies , of all ranks of his people , is not a principle coeval with the earliest part of our history , and which , on many occasions , has received all the weight and authority , that the sanction of King , Lords , and Commons , could give it . It is upon that prerogative , which , I trust , will not be contested at this day , that the General Defence Act of a former session was framed , and out of that act the present volunteer system has , in a great measure , arisen . But before I go into the consideration of this bill , I beg leave , my Lords , to advert to an observation made by a noble baron ( Lord Grenville , ) `` that much as he admired the volunteers and the loyal and patriotic spirit by which they were actuated , yet he never could consent to their being employed in any other way than as an auxiliary force , in which situation , he had no doubt , but that they would render incalculable service . '' My Lords , to the wisdom and policy of that observation , I most cordially agree ; I never imagined , I never intended , that the volunteers should act in any other capacity than as a secondary and subsidiary force ; and I am persuaded , that should they be ever called into the field in aid ( I mean in that way in which their habits and degree of discipline have best fitted them for ) of his Majesty 's regular forces , that they will not belie the sanguine expectations that those , who look most favourably upon them , have formed.—I wish , now , my Lords , to say a few words as to that other description of force provided by his Majesty 's govt , and to which I must always consider the volunteers , as I have said before , secondary and subsidiary : and in communicating to this House , and to the country , the extent of that force , as high perhaps in point of number , certainly as high in character and discipline , as ever the energy and loyalty of a bee people supplied , I feel ample matter for confidence and exultation . My Lords , we have at this time within the United Kingdom , an army , composed of troops of the Hue and militia , amounting to no less than 180,000 men . 1024 When I compare this with the force which we had in the months of March and April , 1801 , I find that it exceeds it by
