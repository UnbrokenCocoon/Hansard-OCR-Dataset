met arduous and critical in which this country was ever involved , it undoubtedly is the first duty of every member of this House , to suggest all those means which in his judgment would conduce to the bringing our military system to the highest pitch of perfection , and to the placing die national defence and security upon a great , 262 solid , and permanent basis ; and the accomplishment of these most important objects would , in my opinion , be greatly promoted by the establishment of a military council , properly composed.—When this subject was mentioned on Friday , last by an hon . gent , not now present ( Mr. Fox ) , the Chancellor of the Exchequer told us , that he had reason to believe that many of those who formerly had wished for such a council , were now , upon further consideration of it , convinced that it would be productive of no advantage , and of many inconveniencies to the public service.—I can not pretend to say what change may have taken place in the opinions of others , but I think it right to declare , that mine remains unaltered , that the vote which I formerly gave , when the question was agitated in this House , was not lightly given , and that having fully considered tie subject since , I am confirmed in my conviction of the propriety of that vote.—But , before I proceed to state my reasons for adhering to this opinion , I can not help expressingmy surprize , that whenever the measure has been recommended on the one side , and resisted by his Majesty 's ministers on the other , it has been resisted chiefly on the ground that it would imp'ya want of confidence in the abilities of die commander in chief.—For my own part , Sir , I am very sure that I never made any proposal , never stated any opinion or uttered a single expression in this House , which , if liberally or fairly construed , could possibly be considered as conveying any thing , disrespectful or disparaging of that illustrious personage ; although I well recollect that such insinuations were thrown cut against me both in and out of this House.—I am , however , totally regardless of what may be the effect of these or similar misrepresentations they shall never deter me from freely and openly delivering my opinions : and , therefore , I have no hesitation in declaring that , in the present situation of affairs , I do not believe his Royal Highness to be capable , without further assistance , of doing ample justice to the country in the administration of the various branches of the military department of the public service . When I say this , it is not that I do not think as highly as any man of his Royal highness 's abilities and exertion ; but I do not hold bim to be equal to such a task , because I believe that no one man can perform it.—I am fully sensible , Sir , of the great advantages which the country has derived from his being placed at the head of the army ; and I know that he devotes himself to the discharge of his public duties with a degree of laborious assiduity , rarefy to be met with in any man . and still more rarely , per- 263 haps , in a man of his high birth . But , completely occupied as he is , in dispatching the urgent and pressing business that daily occurs in the command of such a force as we now have on foot , it is not possible that he should have sufficient time and leisure left for reflecting , as deeply and maturely as the subject requires , on all the possible means of improving the national defence , and establishing it upon one great combined and permanent system , —But , it has been said , has he not already a council of able officers to assist him ? Are not the staff
