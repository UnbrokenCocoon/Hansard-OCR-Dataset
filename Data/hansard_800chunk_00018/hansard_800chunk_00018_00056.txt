received no commands from his Royal Highness on the occasion , and that the Message before their lordships had merely reference to the establishment of their royal highnesses the Princesses . rose to request , that the noble Secretary would give the House some information relative to the failure of the First Clerk of the Treasury : and it would depend upon the answer he should receive , whether he should , at some other time , make a motion on the subject . The affair was one of the very first importance . The defalcation , at the very lowest statement of it was not less than 70,000l . He should not , perhaps , have called their lordships attention to the matter in this way , had this been an unique case ; but when they saw the same frauds taking place on other occasions , in the Ordnance Department , and elsewhere , it was not a subject to be passed over lightly . These frauds had now extended to the Treasury itself , which ought to be particularly vigilant against all frauds of this kind . Still , however , he might not have thought it necessary to mention the subject in this manner , had it not been that this person had been long living in habits of extravagance , so that people were surprised how a person in his situation should have been able to expend such large sums in buildings , and other projects .

He meant the affairs of India , and the approaching expiration of the Company 's charter . In this view he had to express his surprise , that not a single document had yet been laid on the table by ministers . What he principally rose for was to ask whether they meant to bring on this great and important subject in the remaining part of the present session ; and to know their opinion whether , during the remainder of the session , there would be adequate time for the due consideration of so extensive and important a question . stated , that it certainly was intended to bring forward the subject adverted to , in the present session of parliament . He had also to state , that a discussion was going on between the Court of Directors and government on the subject ; and he
