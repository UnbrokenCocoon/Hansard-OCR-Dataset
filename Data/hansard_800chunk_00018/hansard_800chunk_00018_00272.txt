had then originated in the other House , and had come before their lord-ships at a late period of the session . The magnitude of the subject was deeply felt by the Prince Regent 's servants ; and they had thought it their duty to consider fully the various interests which it involved , before they laid the matter before parliament They had thought it incumbent on them to lay the measure before parliament in as perfect a shape as possible ; and it was , and had always been , their intention that parliament should have ample time to give it all the consideration which its importance deserved . denied , in the most pointed terms , that there was any intention on the part of ministers , while he was connected with them , to offer any indignity to their lordships ' House , or to treat its authority lightly ; but at the same time he deeply regretted , that a question of this importance ; for it was one of the most important questions , not only with a view to trade ; but in a constitutional , military , and political point of view , that ever came under their lordships ' review—it involved all that was dearest and most vital to the constitution of this country , to its liberties , and to its government , —it involved the consideration of all they owed to that vast empire which they had so long administered , and which , as he should be able to prove when the matter came regularly under discussion , they had , all things considered , administered so well ; he deeply regretted , he repeated , that a question of this vast importance had not , before this late period of the session , been brought regularly under the deliberation of both Houses , in the shape of Resolutions , by which the opinion of parliament might be taken on the prominent features and principles of the system , before the more formal measure was submitted for deliberation .

The real question which at this moment best deserved their attention was , whether they ought not to have an opportunity of deciding upon the prominent principles of the intended India system , as a preliminary to the discussion of the more detailed plan . He was aware , that these observations were irregular ; but he would state one principle now . He believed , that the general basis of the present system was the right one ; but at the same time , many vital improvements might be erected on that basis , even with a view to give complete effect to the principle : but it was not right in the government to refrain from taking the sense of both Houses as the preliminary step . Such , he was satisfied , would be the opinion of every person who was at all aware of the importance of the subject . He regretted that this course had not been adopted , and heard the declaration of the noble lord at the head of the India department with astonishment . For how could they possibly think of proceeding with a measure of this magnitude with out , in the first instance , applying to parliament for a general concurrence in its prominent-features ? —My lords , I hold in my hand 3 Petition , which as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge , I feel it incumbent on me to present to your lordships ; but having uniformly absented myself when-ever the Roman Catholic question has been under discussion , and abstained from giving any opinion on that subject , I request it may be understood , that though my name appears at the head of this Petition , in consequence of the
