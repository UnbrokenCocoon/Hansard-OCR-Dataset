transubstantiation—the invocation of the saints—the adoration of the Virgin Mary—if they were confined to doctrines of that description , in my opinion , I should say that there was no reason for putting the Roman Catholics upon a worse fooling than any other class of Dissenters in the British empire : but that is not the main difference between us . The point which we are to consider , whether right or wrong , is , that there are other tests applied to their opinions that do not relate to points purely religious—that do relate to points connected with the civil and religious government 631 of the state , and which we contend are necessary for the security of the country ; but which the Roman Catholics can not get over . Your lordships will see , that if we look at the Oath of Supremacy , that is one of the tests to which they make objection ; but of which , it appears to me , they have taken a false and erroneous view ; because your lordships are aware that that oath does not call upon a person to say that the King is the head of the Church . It is an oath simply of abjuration—it is an oath that only calls upon a person to say , that no foreign prince , or foreign potentate hath , or ought to have , any power or pre-eminence , or supremacy in these kingdoms . The question then , I say , arises out of the principle already stated , namely , how far this principle is necessary to be maintained , for the security of your civil and religious liberties . As to the case itself , certainly if there could be found any person who never heard of the differences between Protestant and Papist , and to whom it was stated that there was a power in Europe which claimed a general jurisdiction in all countries ; that there were certain countries that denied that jurisdiction ; and the question was put to him , as to the reasonableness or expediency of that independent country so denying that supremacy , that they should put a test to all persons who wished to possess all civil situations , and who claimed civil power and certain other rights , I think , that were such a proposition put to a person—ignorant of the dispute between Catholics and Protestants , the answer would be , that such a proposition was so reasonable , so just , and carried along with it the principle of an independent government and country , that no persons in the state ought to refuse to take it ; or if they did refuse , they ought not to complain of exclusion : because the question here stands upon the same footing . The principle of a Protestant state , feeling that it is independent , that it has full power within itself , and that no power out of it has any authority to interfere in its state policy . It does , therefore , appear to me , that those who claim a right to exercise power in it , should acknowledge the supremacy of its power , and should take an oath to bind them thereto . But then , we hear it now stated in argument , that the Roman Catholics are ready to disclaim all civil and temporal power in any foreign potentate or authority , and that they only wish 632 a spiritual authority in the Pope , to be recognized , exclusively . Now the question is , how far it is possible to separate spiritual from temporal power ? I am not disposed to discuss in the abstract , how far it may be possible to separate them ; but of this I am certain , that it is impossible to separate spiritual and temporal power in any country , in which there is the larger proportion of the population Roman Catholics . This I state as founded upon the system of that Church itself , and I never heard , and I should be glad
