even than in Italy ; but amongst the middle as well as the lower classes , a liberal and enlightened piety , accompanied by the most perfect spirit of toleration . In Switzerland , ( perhaps I should here confine myself to the Pays de Vaud , ) it exhibits in a superior degree all the excellencies which it can boast in France , without its blemishes ; and , to instance in a minor particular the perfect spirit of moderation by which it is there distinguished , it is a fact , ( however incredible it might sound in Ireland ) , that at Lausanne , a church which in the morning is the scene of devotion for the Protestants , serves at noon , without purification , for the worship of the mass . But between the Catholics of Lausanne and the monks of La Trappe , or the more practical disciples of St. Dominic , there is a mighty interval : within whose extensive limits there is , however , not a spot that may not appropriately be filled by the Catholicism of some country in some period.—It seems to me then quite vain to talk of Catholicism in the abstract.—I must look to facts , —and especially to its real practical influence in the country now under our consideration . The Catholicism of Ireland , Sir , appears to me widely different from any thing I have alluded to ; —and for it I can no more find a parallel amongst the varieties of other countries , than amongst their histories I can find a parallel for the history of Ireland . I am well aware of the tender ground on which I am about to tread ; but I hold it my bounden duty to have no reserve upon this subject : and I shall feel the less anxiety in speaking of Ireland as it is , because whatever there is in the system that I should wish to see corrected , corrected I believe it yet may be ; and because I attribute it not to any eternal essence of the Roman Catholic religion , nor 912 to the fault of the people ; ( God forbid ! ) nor to this council or to that , but to the fatal events of Irish history—bloody wars , alternate confiscations , penal codes , and periodical rebellions : and partly to the errors of queen Elizabeth , and partly to the policy of her great rival Philip ; who agreed at least in this , that they alike formed the people of Ireland to the hatred of the English Reformation . Elizabeth associated the English sword * with the English Bible , and taught Ireland to detest them both ; but Philip produced a more lasting impression , and it was a measure of his which by its consequences stamped upon the Catholicism of Ireland , a character peculiar to itself . It was under his auspices , and under the immediate protection of his lieutenant the duke of Alva , that William Allen , an Oxford man , founded the college of Douay : thither resorted in the first instance the banished Jesuits of England ; and every one acquainted with the history of those times , will recollect that this place became the focus of the plots against the life and government of the queen of England . It happened that the successor of the duke of Alva , influenced by motives of which all governments , Protestant and Catholic , are fertile in examples , determined to overturn all the measures of his predecessor , and in his zeal to carry this determination into effect , he forgot to spare even this college . The English fugitives became dispersed over every part of Europe , they were kindly received by the Catholic powers , then at enmity with Elizabeth ; and it was these men , under these auspices , who founded most of the * See the `` Pacata Hibernia , '' passim—the Diary of the Lord President during the latter years of Elizabeth .
