still preserve somewhat of the dignity and the grace of unenforced concession . I am impelled by this additional motive to press these suggestions on your lordships ' attention at the present moment , for the purpose of putting an end to those violent and unmanly threats , proceeding not from the ministers , but from behind the throne ; of tranquillizing your Catholic petitioners by military execution , and returning an answer to their respectful application to the Prince Regent and to the parliament , by his Majesty 's guards , and a certain illustrious personage ; for the purpose of exhibiting to my country-men more forcibly , the blessings of British protection ; and thus conciliating , at the point of the bayonet , a brave and generous population , of four millions of fellow subjects . And finally , to protect the public peace against the recurrence , at any future period , of such unconstitutional , arbitrary , and sanguinary projects , as would justify and demand resistance from every lover of constitutional liberty , and detester of tyrannous oppression . But , perhaps , such idle and impotent denunciations would be best answered by contemptuous silence , and by the consoling conviction , that their authors would assuredly , be more disposed to provoke hostility , than to take their place in the front of battle . Since the commencement of the unfortunate reign of Charles the 1st , blindly welcomed by my Catholic countrymen , as a period pregnant with the happiest prospects , for their religion and for themselves ; —to no event have they ever looked with so much confident and anxious hope , as to that auspicious moment , when , in the fulness of time , the present Heir Apparent to the crown should assume the government of these his realms . In him , they thought they saw the messenger of peace , with healing on his wing—the 523 promised guardian of the people 's rights—of the fomented discord of his father 's Irish subjects , the indignant spectator—of their interests , the avowed and zealous assertor—to Catholic privilege , an assured and plighted friend . When the exercise of the executive functions was suspended , for the first time , by the same awful visitation , Ireland successfully maintained the cause of the Prince , not equally triumphant in this more favoured nation , committing to him , the legitimate heir to all the royal authorities , the administration of his own inheritance , till returning health should restore his sceptre to the suffering King . The heart of the illustrious person overflowed with affectionate and just feelings ; and my confiding countrymen fondly trusted , that they had bound their future monarch to them by a double tie . How sanguine were these hopes ! How strong and firmly rooted the foundations on which they seemed to rest ! But they are gone—blasted at the moment of full maturity ; and , instead of that rich and abundant harvest of national union and prosperity , which we were prepared to gather , as the first fruits of the promised conciliation of the illustrious person , the sharpened edge of a slumbering statute , which had never been awakened before for the annoyance of the people , called , for the first time , into mischievous activity , and turned against the Catholic , assembled for the lawful purpose of remonstrating for the redress of grievances ; and those desperate men who dared thus to intercept , in their constitutional and legitimate progress to the parliament and to the throne , the petitions of an oppressed community of four millions of their fellow subjects , confirmed in the full possession of all their former power , in the full exercise of all their former intolerance , as the ministers of his own peculiar choice , by the first act of the unlimited Regent . We have indeed been told , from the highest authority , that all remembrance of the past should now be buried , in mutual congratulations , on the happy prospects of the present moment—abroad
