zeal for the cause and welfare of the country ; in detestation of the views and designs of any foreign power against the dignity of the crown , or the welfare or independence of the kingdom ; the English Roman Catholics yield to no portion whatever of his Majesty 's subjects . '' They therefore solicit , respectfully solicit . Sir , to participate in the remaining rights and privileges of the constitution , that they may be enabled more efficaciously to rally round the fortunes of the country , in this hour of its need and peril . With these views , they throw themselves with confidence on the wisdom , the policy , the justice , and I hope I may add , on the hearts and feelings of the members of this House . I propose now only to move , that the Petition do lie upon the table ; not meaning , however , to deprive myself of the right of adopting further proceedings on it , in case it should hereafter appear to to me to be my duty to do so . I therefore , shall move , that the Petition be now read , previous to its being laid on the table . The Petition was then read ; setting forth , `` That the petitioners humbly beg leave to represent to the House , that , at the time of his Majesty 's accession to the throne , the laws in force in this kingdom against persons professing the Roman Catholic religion were sanguinary and oppressive ; and that several of these laws have been repealed by the acts of the 18th and 31st of his present Majesty , but that many are still in force against them , from the effects of which they severely suffer ; and that the only ground alleged for continuing these laws in force against them is , their adherence to their religious principles ; but the petitioners humbly beg leave to represent to the House , that this adherence ought not injustice to expose them to penalties or disabilities , as they hold no principle which is adverse to his Majesty 's government , or the duties of good citizens ; they have taken the oaths and signed the declarations prescribed in the acts which have been passed for their relief , and in them have explicitly disclaimed every principle inconsistent with their duty to their king or their country that has ever been charged upon them ; and the petitioners submit to the House , that their uniform and irreproachable conduct , and particularly their refusal of those oaths , the taking of which would at once 481 place them on a level with their fellow subjects , are much stronger and more decisive proofs of the integrity of their principles than can be manifested by any oath or declaration whatsoever : and that , in affection to his Majesty 's sacred person and government , in zeal for the cause and welfare of the country , in detestation of the views and designs of any foreign power against the dignity of the crown , or the welfare or independence of the kingdom , the English Roman Catholics yield to no portion whatever of his Majesty 's subjects ; and praying , that the House will take into consideration the penalties and disabilities to which the English Roman Catholics are still subject , and grant them such relief as shall in their great wisdom be deemed expedient . '' Ordered to lie on the table . , knight of Kerry , rose and said : â€”Sir ; I am charged with the Petition which is to be present ed to this House from the persons whose names are signed thereto , being Protestant land-owners in Ireland . Some circumstances that have occurred regarding it , render it necessary that I should trouble the House with a few words . I would first take the liberty of slating why it has devolved upon so insignificant an individual as myself , to present one of the most important Petitions that can be brought under the consideration
