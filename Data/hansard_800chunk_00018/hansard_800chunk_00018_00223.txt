people in a constitution like that of these realms ; and that they are gratified by the reflection that the attainment of this their constitutional object will prove as conducive to the welfare and security of this great empire , as to the complete relief of the Roman Catholic community ; that it will secure the quiet and concord of their country , animate all classes of the people in the common defence , and form the most , stable protection against the dangers which heavily menace these islands ; for the Petitioners most humbly presume to submit to the House , as their firm opinion , that an equal degree of enthusiasm can not reasonably be expected from men , who feel themselves excluded from a fair participation of the blessings of a good constitution and government , as from those who fully partake of its advantages ; that the enemies of this empire , who meditate its subjugation , found their best hope of success upon the effects of those penal laws , which , by depressing millions of the inhabitants of Ireland , may weaken their attachment to their country , and impair the means of its defence ; and that the continued pressure of these laws in times of unexampled danger only spreads the general feeling of distrustful alarm , and augments the risks of common ruin ; and that , to avert such evils , to preserve and promote the welfare and security of this empire , and to become thoroughly identified with their fellow subjects in interests and affection , are objects as precious in their eyes , upon every consideration of property , principle , and moral duty , as in those of any other description of the inhabitants of these realms ; and that , if , in thus humbly submitting their depressed condition , and their earnest 407 hopes , to the consideration of the House , they would dwell upon the great numbers , and the property of the Roman Catholics of Ireland , already so considerable and so rapidly encreasing , and to their consequent most important contributions to the exigencies of the state , they would do so not with a view of exciting unworthy motives for concession , but in the honest hope of suggesting legitimate and rational grounds of constitutional relief ; and deeply indeed should they lament , if these very recommendations should serve only to hold them out as the objects of harsh suspicion at home , or of daring attempts upon their allegiance from abroad : may the Petitioners then , with hearts deeply interested in the fate of this their humble supplication , presume to appeal to the wisdom and benignity of the House on behalf of a very numerous , industrious , affectionate and faithful body of people , the Roman Catholics of Ireland , and to pray , that the House may be pleased to take into their favourable consideration the whole of their condition , their numbers , their services , their merits , and their sufferings ; and that they may be restored to the rights and privileges of the constitution of their country , be freed from all penal and disabling laws in force against them , on account of their religious faith , and may thereby become more worthy , as well as more capable of promoting the service of the crown , and the substantial interests of this great empire .

Some of these men had been 25 or 30 years in office , without any increase of emolument ; and of late years , under pretence of economy , —an economy of which , in the present instance , he could not approve—their salaries were considerably diminished . Some of these clerks laboured under peculiar hardships , as they had purchased their places . Lord Barham , the late comptroller ,
