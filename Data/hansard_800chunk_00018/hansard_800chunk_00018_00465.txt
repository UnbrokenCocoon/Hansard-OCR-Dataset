action were developed in the fullest manner , and particularly as a time when the measures taken were intimately connected with the subject now under our Consideration : but I know not how it is , that , as if by common consent on both sides of the House , they have abstained from the smallest allusion to what was passing in Ireland at the same period—which , however , will be found , if I mistake not , to abound with matter much more apt for illustration . In the last year of king James the 2nd , after a lapse of twenty-four years since any parliament had sat in Ireland , he summoned one to meet in Dublin , in his own immediate presence . For obvious reasons , Catholicity was likely to be its ruling characteristic ; indeed , the Catholics naturally exerted all their energies to procure the returns of their friends at a moment so auspicious for their views ; and it was the curious , and to us perhaps not uninstructive result of their exertions , that the House of Commons which was returned consisted of six Protestants and about 230 Catholics Here , then , are the Catholics for the last time in full power . Let us now enquire what measures they pursued . But , before entering on any view of their proceedings , allow me to observe that this was no casual concourse of the dregs of the people , but the genuine Catholic aristocracy of Ireland.—I could easily enumerate the names of its principal members ; but the detail might appear invidious , as they are generally the names of the families who in the same towns and counties ( from which these members were respectively returned ) at this day possess deservedly the greatest influence . In truth . Sir , they were not only the political but the natural progenitors of some of the most 924 respectable members of the present Catholic Committee . Like that Committee , they possessed the property , the intelligence , and the spirit of the party of that day ; like them also , they consisted of persons , individually no doubt of great respectability and worth , but whose actions as a party it remains for us to consider . Their first act was to repeal an Act well known in Ireland by the name of the Act of Settlement—of which it may be not unnecessary to inform the English gentlemen in this House , that it was an Act which had passed in the 14th and 15th years of Charles the second , confirming to the various Protestant proprietors , the estates which , after the troubles of his father 's reign , and a long course of grants and forfeitures , a court of claims had respectively allotted to them.—Many of these lands , I am ready to admit , had been seized by the violence and injustice inseparable from civil wars , but the infinitely greater proportion of them had been forfeited by the undoubted treasons of the original proprietors . This Act of Settlement , as appears by the Down Survey , constituted the title to rather more than 12 millions of English acres , that is , to about two-thirds of the whole of Ireland : twenty seven years had then elapsed since the passing of the Act ; and these lands had become the object , not merely of family settlements and incumbrances , but of the most extensive improvemens that had ever been effected within the same period in any country.—This Act was simply repealed by the Catholic parliament , and the whole of these lands vested in his majesty for the purpose of redelivery to the old Catholic proprietors , as they might respectively make good their titles ; and the repeal thus summarily disposed of all the property which the Protestants of Ireland had acquired during the forty-eight years preceding , during the last twenty-seven of which they had been in undisturbed and unquestioned possession . I am aware that I address some gentlemen , who , if they spoke out
