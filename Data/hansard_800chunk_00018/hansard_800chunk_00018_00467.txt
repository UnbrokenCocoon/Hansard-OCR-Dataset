Boyne , —an event to which the least allusion , in this age of extended liberality , is considered as the mark of the most bigoted intolerance in the descendants of those whom it thus rescued . I am well aware , in making this statement , I shall be severely reprobated for ripping up wounds which , as will be said , have been long since closed : but when we hear so much of the alleged infraction of the treaty of Limerick , as the true cause of all the heart-burnings of the present day , it seems not amiss on the other hand to go back to a period only two years antecedent to that time , to consider fairly together these almost contemporaneous transactions , and to deny the justice of the historical reference of my hon . friend opposite , which draws the line of demarcation between the ancient and modern history of Ireland with such curious felicity as exactly to include the one , and exclude the other , holding up the former as the fairest subject for political illustration , but classing the latter among those antiquated transactions , which none but a bigot of the darker ages could think of recollecting . It is not , however , merely for this purpose that I make this reference.—I admit that a new repeal of the Act of Settlement is not now within the scope of any person . Independent of so many Catholics now deriving their own titles under that Act , nothing would be so difficult , as to ascertain the heirs of most of the original forfeiters , who are now indeed in the very lowest ranks of society ; and if their persons were as , certain as they are doubtful , it is not to be 927 supposed that any party would throw the country into confusion for their sakes ; —I can not , however , go the length of saying , that these scenes afford no ground of inference at all.—Gentlemen on the other side rely on history for this promised moderation.—Well , here is her evidence—here are the political actions of the Catholic party at the latest , and that no remote period , when full action was within its power . It is replied , the Catholics are now changed.—Most willingly I admit it , but the degree of that change is a question which still remains for consideration ; and it is a more summary than sufficient method of disposing of it , at once to denounce as intolerant , and bund , and mad bigots , all those Protestants , who looking first to the transactions of 1689 , next to the great blank that succeeded during the operation of the penal code , and finally to the fever which has subsisted ever since its relaxation , still hesitate to assume it is a matter quite self-evident , on the ground of historic reference alone , that the change alluded to is so perfect and complete , that the Catholics , if now admitted into full political power , do not retain even sufficient distinctness of views or feelings , to form them into a separate party in the state . For this is really now all the question between the two sides of the House . Convince me that the Catholics , if admitted , would at once amalgamate with the different parties that exist , that Catholicism would cease to be a watch-word , that is , that no Catholic objects would remain for attainment , and I withdraw every opposition to the instant completion of their desires . On the other hand , show me four millions of Protestants bound together , with important and tempting objects in their view , separate and distinct from the rest of their fellow countrymen , and speaking through the organ of one hundred members in this House , and I say the constitution is exposed to a new , an untried , and a great danger . But it is answered loudly , the Catholics have none such . This is indeed become
