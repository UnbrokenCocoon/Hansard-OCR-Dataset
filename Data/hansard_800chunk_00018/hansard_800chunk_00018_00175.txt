, and to prevent the still greater calamities which the Petitioners are persuaded would result from the continuance of the Order in Council of the 26th of April 1809 . '' presented a Petition from several merchants and manufacturers interested in the woollen trade , and resident in the West Riding of Yorkshire ; setting forth , `` That the Petitioners form a considerable portion of that description of his Majesty 's subjects whose persevering industry has contributed to raise to a pre-eminent degree of wealth and greatness this their native country ; and that the Petitioners are sensible of the existing national difficulties , and of the various and unjust means devised by the inveterate and subtle enemy of their country to injure and destroy their national independence , and have , therefore , borne without complaint a large portion , and are yet willing cheerfully to undergo their share , of the privations necessary to effect the national safety , but they can not any longer refrain 331 from representing to the House the distress which they feel as a body , in a much severer degree than most of their fellow subjects , occasioned , as it appears to the Petitioners , by a perseverance in that system of commercial regulations known under the name of the British Orders in Council , adopted and pursued ever since the year 1807 , and at the same time expressing to the House a doubt , which the Petitioners very sensibly feel , how those measures can tend to promote the national security , which , after so long a trial , produce nothing but ruin to the national commerce ; and that their houses and warehouses are stored with goods prepared for foreign markets to which they have no access ; when the ports of Europe were shut to our manufactures , they consoled themselves with the fruits of their trade to America , and since the interruptions that have happened to the extensive commerce previously carried on between that country and this , they have endeadeavoured to find markets for their goods elsewhere ; but collectively their endeavours and their enterprizes prove vain and fruitless , large stocks of manufactured goods remain on hand , their capitals are locked up in commodities , for the sale of which the proper markets are shut against them , and their industry is paralized ; and that the number of bankruptcies and insolvencies that have recently taken place in old commercial houses of well-established credit and extensive dealings , as well as those of lesser note , are the effect , and the evidence also , of the ruinous consequences of the British Orders in Council , for , until they were acted upon , the commercial Decrees of the French government were harmless to the Petitioners ; if other evidence be needful , they appeal to the fact of the great reduction within the last four years in the number of master manufacturers in the said riding , a class of men whose active employment of a small capital , aided by their own personal skill and industry , has essentially contributed to raise and establish a competition , and a spirit of enterprize and exertion in the whole body of merchants and manufacturers which has so long secured the preference to British woollens in every foreign market , and that the distress and ruin of so many master manufacturers , added to the general stagnation of trade , have thrown out of employ great numbers of the labouring class of manufacturers , many of whom are thereby driven to seek 332 parochial relief , or to worse and more unjustifiable courses , and instead of contributing by their usual labours to the wealth of the nation , only multiply the heavy burdens and distresses to which those of the Petitioners are subjected who are not yet reduced to the same deplorable condition ; and praying the House to take these facts into their most serious consideration , and adopt such measures , tending either to rescind or modify the aforesaid Orders in Council or otherwise , as the House
