prerogative . He might be right as to principles ; but was no allowance to be made for the noblest and most patriotic feelings ? When they considered the state of the country , involved in a struggle , in which her very existence was at stake—her population groaning-under a load of taxes , her manufactures ruined , and her currency depreciated , could any of the noble lords on the opposite benches say , that an extraordinary remedy was not necessary to remove evils so portentous and so complicated in their nature ? And where could that remedy be sought but in the removal of men who were still so obstinately wedded to the very measures which had brought the country to such a crisis ? Those men so bigotted in their opposition to the Roman Catholics of Ireland , could not be ignorant of the actual state of that country.—They were not to learn , that perhaps in the course of two months , an insurrection might be apprehended ; that it had been lately on the point of breaking out , on account of an advance in the price of provisions—and this was the moment they chose to avow , in the most insulting terms , a system of perpetual exclusion against the Roman Catholics of Ireland.—The population of Ireland furnished one half of the forces of the empire , and this was the moment they chose to disgust them from the service . He declared on his honour as a peer , and as if speaking in the face of the Almighty , that in his opinion England could find no safety , but by conciliating the people of Ireland this was his confirmed , his unshakeable conviction . He knew of no other method , and he was confident there was no other method . There was no hope for safety in the present arduous struggle , but by cementing the bonds of union between all classed , of people , by uniting all hearts and all hands for the defence of the empire , and by rallying the whole of the population round the standard of the constitution . The language held out on that night by the noble lord , had , however , removed those pleasing hopes from the reach even of imagination , and no alternative remained for the safety of the country , but the removal of the ministers who had avowed such principles . He repealed that he had come down to the House undetermined as to the vote be should give . The 89 speech of the noble lord opposite had fixed his irresolution , and opened his eyes ; he should therefore vote for the original motion . presented a Petition from several inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood of Blackburn , in the county of Lancaster , setting forth , `` That , in the exercise of those inestimable rights with which the constitution of the country has invested them , the Petitioners venture to lay before the House their sentiments and feelings on subjects of the highest importance to their national and individual welfare ; and that in the institution of the authorities of the House , the Petitioners behold that link which unites them to the throne , and to the House , as the Representatives of the people , they direct their confidence and expectations ; the immediate connection of the House with those whose suffrages have entrusted to them the preservation of the interests of the Petitioners , naturally emboldens them to look to their sympathy for commiseration , to their wisdom for direction , and to their measures for redress ; they will therefore state , with respectful submission , the circumstances on which their claims to the attention of the House are founded , and , in making this appeal to them , they are persuaded , that not only are their own convictions expressed , but the known undisguised and avowed convictions of thousands in every part of the united empire ; and that the Petitioners reside in the most populous of the manufacturing counties , and unhappily possess
