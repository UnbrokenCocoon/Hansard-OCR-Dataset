by which such impolicy is inevitably attended . â€”My lords ; I do not rise at this late hour of the night , to enter into any argument , but to explain one point ; or , indeed , I may say , to apologize to the noble and learned lord for interrupting him when addressing your lordships . The nature and motive of that interruption he has indeed , mistaken ; but apology is due to him for any thing bordering on inattention ; and I can assure him that ray remark , which was made too loudly , was owing first to the circumstance to which he has himself adverted , the part of the House from which he speaks : and 2dly , to the great good humour with which he generally receives every thing of the sort ; but when I so irregularly exclaimed to the noble lord to read the Bill of Rights , I did not mean to imply , ( God forbid I should ) that he had not read , nor did not understand , the Bill of which he was speaking ; I did not mean to recommend him to read an act of parliament , with which I was , and am well convinced , that he is perfectly familiar ; but I called upon him , irregularly , I admit , but not disrespectfully , to have the Bill of Rights read at the table , in order to enable the House to judge of the practice of that observation , on which he has this night laid such a stress . The noble and learned lord maintains , that the exclusion of Roman Catholics from parliament and offices , is part of the fundamental law of our constitution , as declared by the Bill of Rights . It is that point I wished to be explained ; and it is that point which , I think , the reading of the Bill of Rights would completely clear up ; and set not only in a different , but in an opposite light , to that in which the noble and learned lord has presented it to your lordships . It would detain the House to have the Bill read at length ; but if any there be on whom this part of the noble and learned lord 's statement has made an impression unfavourable to the repeal of the exclusive laws , I trust they will refer to the Bill itself ; and in it I contend they will find nothing which precludes them from repealing the laws of exclusion ; nothing which enacts or implies , that those laws are fundamental in our constitution , or absolutely and permanently essential to its security . There are , indeed , two distinct parts of the Bill of Rights ; that which , after reciting the illegal and unexceptionable endeavours of king James 2 , proceeds to declare , re-enact , and confirm the ancient and undoubted rights of Englishmen : 700 the other , which enacts what was necessary to the object of the time , the establishment of king William on the throne . The first part , which contains thirteen articles , declared to be the ancient and undoubted rights of Englishmen , may be called fundamental ( if , indeed , any law is fundamental in a state , which has a supreme legislature in it like ours ) but in these thirteen articles , declaratory of our ancient and undoubted rights , '' the words Protestant , or Catholic , never once occur , except in stating that Protestants shall not be deprived of their arms : with that exception , there is not one of the thirteen declarations that might not be equally maintained as the rights of the people of this country , if the Roman Catholic , or even the Mahometan religion , were established throughout it to-morrow . Unquestionably , the violation of some of these exclusive laws , that is , the dispensing with the tests required by law , formed part of the charge against James 2 ,
