near Liverpool , had been purchased for these barracks . Ground too , that had many buildings upon it . The expence of this purchase amounted to 27,000l . He contended , that the lot of ground was much larger than was necessary for a barrack for 1,000 men , and that a scite in every respect as eligible as the one selected , might have been had at a price considerably less . The Petition on the table from so many respectable inhabitants of Liverpool , against the erection of those barracks on this particular ground , 1138 claimed the particular consideration of the House . He understood that colonel Dyer , a gentleman sent down to examine the situation fixed upon , had pronounced other situations in every way as eligible . He stated also , that he had understood that government might have had towards the north of the town , from lord Darnley , as much ground as they had paid 27,000l . for , for only 6,000l . The barracks at Bristol were intended for 800 men , and were to cost 60,000l . There was no reason assigned for these new barracks , but that of prisoners being kept at Bristol , as if that was peculiar to Bristol , or as if there were not many towns where prisoners were kept , and yet where there were no barracks . Besides , so far back as 1803 , government had had some intention of erecting barracks there , but upon mature consideration had abandoned it . But the plan of erecting barracks in Marylebone , he thought of all the others the most seriously objectionable ; they were called upon to vote a sum of 133,500l . for cavalry barracks for 450 men . Hitherto the 2nd regiment of horse guards had been reckoned at 416 men , but in this estimate they had been increased to 450 . But this was not the whole , there were also artillery barracks , magazines , ordnance stores in contemplation . He affirmed that plans of such had been confidentially spoken of , and that as the House could not be ignorant of them , they would by voting this estimate be pledged to follow up the remaining plans , no matter what the expence . This was evident from the great extent of the ground , not less than 27 acres in the heart of the metropolis . It was a most serious matter , to consider whether they would give government the power to raise a military depôt , in such a city as London , a sort of Prætorian camp that could not but be hostile to the feelings of the people , and might eventually be dangerous to their liberties ! It was equally objectionable on the ground of expence , ground near Marylebone would sell for 35 years purchase , this would make an addition of 35 or 40,000l . to the estimate , making the whole expence of purchase and building amount to about 170,000l . which would be at the rate of 400l . for every man and horse , besides the mere wall of enclosure would cost 4 or 5,000l . and the gravelling the ground would cost 8,000l . The cavalry barracks in Hyde Park , built in the years 1792–3 , cost 52,247l . Exeter barracks for 215 men , coat only 29,625l . Dorchester bar- 1139 racks for 421 men , cost 34,456l . being at the rate of 82l . for each man and horse . Edinburgh cavalry barracks for 406 men , cost but 31,870l . being only at the rate of 78l . for every man and horse , whereas in the plan before them , the expence would be at the rate of 400l . for every man and horse , this was an excess that no difference in the price of materials then and now could at all explain or account for . It was , he contended , a total departure from I all economical honest principles , and from all controul , and as such he disapproved
