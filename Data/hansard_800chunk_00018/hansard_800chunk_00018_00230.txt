9,000 persons , praying for complete Liberty of Conscience to all the subjects of the Brisish empire . These Petitions were signed by Christions of all denominations , dissenting from the church of England . It was almost exactly similar to a Petition , which he had had the honour of presenting to the House on the same subject three years ago . In using the word `` honour , '' he meant it not to be understood , not as in the ordinary course of expression , when a person presented any application to that House , but as expressive of the gratification which he felt , and honour which he esteemed to have been conferred on him , in having that Petition put into his hands by one of the most enlightened and liberal Christians in this or any other country . A man who , during a long life , had been distinguished for universal benevolence and charity , and who was still anxious , even at his advanced period of life , not to relax in his exertions , but to persevere to the ecd in that course , and for that object , for which he had laboured through lifeâ€”good will to his fellow men , and peace on earth ! After having said this , he was satisfied that he had sufficiently designated the person to whom he alluded , to be the Rev . M. Wyvill . The Petitions which he had to present were from York , Sheffield , Leeds , Hull , Norwich , & c. The Petitions were then brought up and read , setting forth , `` That the Petitioners were Christians , who consider absolute liberty of conscience respecting religion to be the unalienable right of all men , that it is the duty of all men to examine as diligently as may be in their power , the doctrines of religion , and after such diligent examination , to 419 adopt and to profess what may appear to them to be the truth ; and that , in the performance of that duty , men ought not to be obstructed or discouraged , or otherwise tempted to act hyprocritically , by any law tending to bias them in the course of such examination of the doctrines of religion , by subjecting them , in the case of their dissenting from the doctrines of any I established church , to suffer death by burning or otherwise , or to suffer any corporal or pecuniary punishment , or to be injured in their reputation by any disability more or less disgraceful ; and that the Petitioners acknowledge , with high satisfaction , that , in the present reign , considerable progress has been made towards the full restoration of the rights of conscience , by the wisdom of parliament and the benignity of the king rescinding various laws , in whole or in part , which were violations of those rights ; yet , since other penal laws , not less injurious to ( hose rights , remain unrepealed , since some of these laws subject to corporal punishments or pecuniary penalties , others , as in the case of the test laws passed in the reign of king Charles the second , subject to disgrace , disability , and privation of civil rights , persons , whose only offence it is that , in conformity with their duly , they have examined the doctrines of religion , and by such examination have been induced to embrace and to profess religious opinions different from the doctrines of the Established Church ; and that the Petitioners feel it to be their duty humbly but earnestly to remonstrate against the longer continuance of any of those intolerant laws ; and they do , in conformity with the premises , expressly petition the House , that every such law may be repealed , and the rights of conscience may thus be restored to all the subjects of this United Kingdom ; and the Petitioners humbly beg leave to add , that this request , as it appears to them , is grounded
