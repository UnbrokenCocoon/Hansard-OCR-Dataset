to about 45,000,000 of dollars.—Of these 3,000,000 were to Prussia , 20,000,000 to England , 18,000,000 to Spain and Portugal , 1,190,000 to France , and to all other parts of the world between 2 and 300,000 . Compare the importance of her customers . To France her exports were under 2,000,000 , to England and her allies 38,000,000 , out of 45,000,000 , the total amount of her exports . This was the state of American commerce , and if the measures which she had thought proper to adopt were injurious to us , what were they less than ruinous to her ? The whole revenue of America , with the exception of the post-office , amounting to about 60,000l . was raised on the imports . There were no internal taxes , they being all repealed a few years ago . America must , therefore , be suffering in her resources and revenue in every direction . Much had been said of what we had suffered in our shipping ; but a much larger part of it was employed in the continental trade , than in the trade with America . There was an account of all the shipping employed by Great Britain , on the table . It had been said , nothing but foreign shipping was employed in the carrying trade , and that not a ship of our own was to be seen at sea . The shipping of 1811 , was higher than that of 1806 . In 1811 , there were 12,774 . In l806 , 12,239 . In the last year he admitted there was a falling off of 300 British ships ; but in 1810 , there were 6,000 foreign ships employed , and this year they had fallen down to 3,000 . It had been stated by the member for Hull , that government stores were frequently carried in neutral ships—but he could say , that the government had always acted sacredly on this principle , never to employ a neutral ship , when a British ship could be found to go . He proceeded to notice the state of the manufactures in this country , and adverted to the West India interests , which he contended , would suffer from an opening of the ports of France . With respect to the license system , it had its origin with the last government , but he thought it perfectly justifiable and necessary , to prevent the trade of the country being cramped . Many of the objectionable oaths had been 1103 now done away . The licensing system had been treated as if new in its nature , but the fact was , that it had always been had recourse to in former wars , in trading with the West India colonies . Notwithstanding what had been said of the unfavourable situation of the country , and all that the French emperor had done to injure us , he hart the satisfaction to state that the exchanges had risen since last April , 15½ per cent . with Hamburgh , 9¼ with Amsterdam , and 12 per cent . with Paris . He thought upon the whole , he had made it clear to the House , that notwithstanding all the power of the enemy , the trade to Europe was still carried on with considerable advantage , and that it would be great indiscretion in us , to give up a more extensive trade than that with America , for the uncertain advantages which might possibly result from opening the French ports , and renewing our intercourse with America . Having said so much on the question , he hoped he might be excused for trespassing for a few moments on the attention of the House with respect to what concerned himself personally . There was a Petition on the table of the House , in which he was described as holding a large sinecure office , and totally insensible to the miseries of the country . The noble lord had said he had made use on a certain recent occasion , of very indecorous expressions . He
