Under every circumstance , he would give his decided vote for going into the enquiry . presented a Petition from the merchants , ship owners , and other inhabitants of Bridlington , in the East Riding of the county of York ; setting forth , `` That the approaching expiration of the East India Company 's charter having occupied the attention of the House , the petitioners beg leave respectfully to state their hopes and wishes on that important subject ; and that the petitioners are fully persuaded that if the trade to the British dominions in India , and to the immense and populous countries included in the charter , were laid open to the skill , industry and capital of private merchants , it would be conducted with a degree of energy and economy which a large public body is incapable of exercising ; new channels of commerce would be discovered , the consumption of our manufactures extended , and our shipping increased , to the advantage of the parties concerned , and the permanent augmentation of the wealth , power and resources of the British empire ; and that the extensive and flourishing commerce of the United Slates of America with India and the Chinese empire exhibits a proof that these expectations of advantage , from the exertions of private individuals , are not unfounded ; and that the petitioners beg leave respectfully to represent , that any partial modification of the trade would , in their opinion , fall extremely short of those advantages which would accrue from the total abolition of the existing monopoly ; and they do therefore humbly and earnestly deprecate any continuation of the Company 's exclusive privilege to the commerce with China ; they conceive that the British character forbids the injurious suspicion that their intercourse with the Chinese would be disturbed by a conduct deficient 1136 in discretion or propriety , whilst the Americans and other nations have maintained a similar intercourse without interruption- ; they also think that no greater necessity for a monopoly exists with a view to secure the duties on tea than those on sugar , rum , or any other highly taxed article of importation ; and they trust that no reason can be found , either in justice or policy , for the exclusion of the out ports from the benefit of the trade with India ; and the petitioners also hope , that the House will not impose any restraint on the British merchant respecting the burthen of any vessel to be employed in the trade , but leave the choice to his own judgment and discretion ; and that the commercial distresses which the petitioners have , in common with the rest of the kingdom , experienced from the enormous power and influence of the enemy on the continent of Europe , furnish abundant reasons for applying to the House , with earnestness and with confidence , for the purpose of opening new channels of intercourse with those distant regions , where the success of his Majesty 's arms , by sea and by land , has established British dominion on a permanent basis , and has secured British commerce against all danger of hostile interference ; and praying the House to adopt such measures , as to their wisdom shall seem meet , for granting to all his Majesty 's subjects , from and after the expiration of the East India Company 's charter , a free trade to and from India and its dependencies , and to and from the empire of China .
