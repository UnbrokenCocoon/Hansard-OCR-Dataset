of the country are primarily occasioned by the present ruinous and long protracted war , by the sacrifice of the manufacturing and commercial interests of the country to war , measures injurious only to ourselves , 1061 thereby destroying and drying up the very sources of revenue , and , in particular , by the Orders in Council affecting in their operation our trade with neutral states ; and that the consequences of these Orders are more particularly felt in the port of Liverpool , where , during the year 1807 , being immediately prior to the operation of the Orders in Council , 489 American vessels , independently of other neutral ships , were cleared out , and where , in the course of six months , in the year 1809 , when the effect of such Orders was understood to be suspended by negociation , 336 American vessels were cleared out , which ships were laden almost entirely with British manufactures , having afforded in their outfit profitable employment to great numbers of merchants , tradesmen , mechanics , and labourers of the town of Liverpool ; and that , in consequence of the Orders in Council of November , 1807 , continued in certain of their provisions by another Order in Council of the 2Gth of April , 1809 , the shipments from neutral states to that port are become very inconsiderable ; and that , in particular , the merchants of the American states , being by local regulations of their own government prevented , during the continuance of the Orders in Council , from importing , in return for their cargoes , the manufactures of this country , are compelled to draw bills of exchange for the proceeds of their shipments , which bills have been for some months last past at a discount in the united States of 15 to 20 percent. , and are now nearly unsaleable at any price ; a circumstance felt at the present time with particular pressure by this country , from its enhancing the price and greatly diminishing the quantity of grain and flour imported from America ; and that , whilst the direct effect of the Orders in Council has been to diminish and injure the revenues , commerce , and manufactures of these kingdoms , they have also compelled neutrals to rely upon their own efforts for those articles which were before supplied by this country , and notoriously to establish manufactories of various kinds , which must eventually lead to an exclusion of British manufactures , and thereby render permanent those evils which are at present experienced ; and that the petitioners can not but contemplate with the most pointed sentiments of disapprobation , the system of a licensed trade with the enemy , by which a power of dispensing with the laws is vested in the minister for the time 1062 being , and has been exercised , as the petitioners humbly apprehend , to a most dangerous and alarming extent : that the direct and immediate effect of such measures is the increase of the naval power of our enemies , the transferring the commerce of this country to hostile and foreign traders , and the encouragement of crimes which destroy all confidence amongst civilized states , and which , when limited in their effects to these realms , are punished with the most exemplary severity ; the petitioners therefore most humbly , but confidently , call upon the House to vindicate the national character , and to mark with due reprobation a system of intercourse involving the breach of all moral obligation , highly dangerous to the ultimate safety of the country , and supported by perjury , forgery , and fraud ; and that the petitioners humbly conceive that these and many other evils would be done away by withdrawing the Orders in Council , that such a measure , by restoring a free intercourse between this country and neutral states , would relieve the nation in general , and the town of Liverpool in particular , from great and increasing distress , would open and restore to our manufacturers the
