evils they deplore ; and that they consider the system of licences as a virtual acknowledgment of the impolicy of the Orders in Council , giving relief to their inveterate enemy , affording a just cause of complaint to those whom they desire to consider their friends , degrading to the character of the British merchant , subversive of morality , and highly injurious to the navy of Great Britain , a system which , at the same time that it affords a partial and dear-bought assistance to the commerce of the metropolis , renders not the smallest relief to the distressed manufacturers of the United Kingdom ; and that , when nearly all the channels of trade to the continent of Europe are closed , the commerce of the East , possessed by an exclusive monopoly , and the national expenditure unparalleled in the annals of the world , the Petitioners deem it incumbent upon them earnestly to recommend to the consideration of the House , the propriety of revoking those measure which the Petitioners conceive to have been originally contrary to the recognised laws of nations , inconsistent with the principles of sound policy , and which threaten to involve this kingdom in a war with its most valuable commercial connection , America , a country linked to England by the powerful affinities of common origin , similarity of language , laws and manners ; and that , in the opinion of the Petitioners , the direct tendency of 427 the Orders in Council is to force America upon her own resources , and to oblige her to become a manufacturing nation much earlier than , in the natural course of events , would be the case ; and that the town and neighbourhood of Birmingham , containing a most numerous population , and being unquestionably one of the most important manufacturing districts in the British empire , have greatly depended upon a friendly intercourse with the United States of America , and are suffering most severely under the operation of the Orders in Council ; and that , if this destructive system be persisted in , thousands of laborious and respectable mechanics will inevitably be deprived of their present partial and precarious employment ; and whilst the Petitioners deplore their distressed situation , aggravated by the advancing price of every necessary of life , their concern is greatly heightened by the consideration , that the capital of the merchants and manufacturers is rapidly absorbing in stock , constantly depreciating in value , their ability to participate in the increasing burdens of the state pro-portionably diminishing , and their efforts consequently paralysed , at a period when all practicable means should be resorted to for cementing national union , and supporting with vigour the momentous contest in which we are engaged ; and earnestly praying the House to take measures for obtaining a revocation of the Orders in Council . '' rose , and said , that it was impossible for him to see Petitions of this kind , signed by 14,000 persons , presented to that House , without feeling a sensation of regret that they should so silently be ordered to lie on the table . He could not think of the distresses under which the Petitioners laboured , and which in other places had led to confusions and riots of the most alarming kind , without in some measure calling the attention of the House to the subject . The effects which these Orders in Council were calculated to produce were now seen on the people of England . The present Petitioners were not disloyal or disaffected persons—they were not men disposed to obstruct the government—but to support it . They had even been willing to suppose that the measures adopted were salutary ones , and , in expectation of a change for the better , the masters had gone on keeping their 428 workmen in employment , though to a limited extent ; till now , seeing themselves reduced to ruin by their exertions to carry on their trade under every disadvantage , and those under them brought to a slate of starvation ,
