to the feelings of their flocks for a precarious subsistence ; —when instead of looking to a foreigner and an enemy for their promotion , and to I know not what professors at Maynooth for those undiscovered studies which they decorate with the title of dogmatical theology ; —when instead of claiming and exercising a distinct and illegal consistorial jurisdiction ; —and , instead of lying bound in those Papal fetters which the other nations of the earth have broken , but which the policy of Ireland has hitherto contrived to rivet ; —instead of this their present si- 931 tuation , they shall receive from the state their stipends , and from home their promotion , and from Maynooth , under proper regulations , a reasonable system of Roman Catholic divinity ; and abandon their pretensions of judicial power to the known tribunals of the land , and hold with Rome only such relations as were permitted to the Gallican Church before it was tainted with revolution ; —and , above all , if they will heartily co-operate with us in executing a plan stated in a Report which will shortly be on the table of this House , which , closing the labours of the Board of Education , proposes measures for dispelling that cloud of thick darkness which still overshadows the great mass of Ireland 's population—then . Sir , I shall consider the Catholicism of Ireland as disarmed upon all points of reasonable apprehension ; and I shall be for conceding the prayer of this Petition , in the hope and belief , that it may be conceded with safety to the Protestant , and with benefit to the empire : —but , if without those safeguards you grant the boon , I do in ray soul believe you seal the separation of the British islands , or must put your trust in a civil war for its prevention . The present time forbids every hope of making any one such arrangement : —instead of that conciliatory language which could alone lead to its conclusion , —we are told of their `` numbers , their tenable passes , their supplies of forage , and their positions apt for attack and defence '' —add to this , a regular system of unlimited misrepresentation , unsparing personal proscription , and bold denunciation of every individual who ventures to oppose them ; it being ever the first fruits of that liberality of sentiment , which their advocates arrogate so exclusively to themselves , to hurl an anathema against all who presume to entertain an opposite opinion of their own , —the worst symptom of the worst spirit of the worst revolutions . They must completely change both their terms and their tone before we can treat with them at all.—That they will change them , is a hope which future days may realize , but which every appearance of the present threatens only to disappoint . .—Sir ; under the peculiar circumstances of the present question , I rise to trespass as shortly as possible upon the attention of the House . I find it impossible to content myself with a silent vote ; as if I did , it is more than 932 probable my motives for that vote might be much misunderstood ; and least I should be charged with compromising my consistency in giving a different vote this night , from that which I gave upon a former occasion , I am extremely anxious that the grounds of my vole now should be distinctly known . I have in the first place to declare that my attachment to the Protestant Establishment is as zealous and devoted now as ever it has been , and that no consideration on earth could now or shall ever tempt me for one moment to compromise any one of its essential principles ; but that as it always has been , so it is now , that the security of that establishment could not be hazarded without endangering the security of the constitution . With these sentiments impressed on my mind , it will not , I hope , be supposed
