there proposed to grant the freedom of the city of Dublin to major O'Donoghoe , in consideration of the signal valour and ability which that gallant officer had displayed in the defence of Tariffa , against an infinitely superior French force . His eminent services in that defence were proved by his being entrusted with the dispatches , which bore testimony to his distinguished gallantry . The majority of that corporate assembly gave a decided negative to the freedom , which was expressly refused to major O'Donoghoe be because he was a Roman Catholic ! How striking is the display of loyal attachment to the constitution , in thus withholding from the brave defenders of their country their well-earned rewards ! presented a Petition from the Roman Catholics of 402 the Queen 's County , in Ireland , setting forth , `` That the Petitioners beg leave respectfully , at this most important conjuncture to solicit the favourable attention of the House to the peculiar condition of the Roman Catholics of Ireland , under the severe penal laws now in force against them ; and that , if they appear to the House to persevere with more than common earnestness in their humble solicitations for the abrogation of those laws , and for a free admission to the blessings and benefits of the civil constitution of their country , the Petitioners trust that their perseverance will be viewed rather as a proof of their just title to the liberty which they seek , and of their sincerity in its pursuit , than as the result of any sentiment hostile to the peace or true interests of this empire ; and that the Petitioners should sincerely-dread lest their silence might be construed by a faithful but feeling people as an indication of despair , and they would not lightly abandon the pursuit of a laudable and most important object , strengthened as they are by the concurring support of their generous and enlightened fellow countrymen , as well as by the fullest approbation of their own conscientious feelings ; they beg leave humbly to state to the House , that they have publicly and solemnly taken every oath of fidelity and allegiance which the jealous caution of the legislature has , from time to time , imposed as tests of their political and moral principles ; and , although , they are still set apart ( how wounding to every sentiment of honour ! ) as if unworthy of credit in these their sworn declarations , they can appeal confidently to the sacrifices which they and their forefathers have long made , and which they still make ( rather than violate conscience by taking oaths of a spiritual import contrary to their belief ) , as decisive proofs of their profound reverence for the sacred obligation of an oath ; and that , by those awful tests , they have bound themselves , in the presence of the all-seeing Deity , whom all classes of Christians adore , to be faithful and bear true allegiance to their most gracious sovereign lord king George the 3rd , and him to defend , to the utmost of their power , against all conspiracies and attempts whatsoever against his person crown , or dignity ; to use their utmost endeavours to disclose and make known to his Majesty and his heirs , all treason and traitorous conspiracies which may be 403 formed against him or them , and faithfully to maintain , support , and defend , to the utmost of their power , the succession to the crown in his Majesty 's family against all persons whomsoever ; and that , by those oaths , they have renounced and abjured obedience and allegiance unto any other person claiming or pretending a right to the crown of this realm ; that they have rejected , as unchristian and impious to believe , the detestable doctrine , that it is lawful in any ways to injure any person or persons whomsoever , under pretence of their being heretics , and also that unchristian and impious principle , that no faith is to be kept with
