government of the country at the time adverted to by the noble baron , he certainly could not speak from any personal knowledge ; but they all knew , that when the circumstance had been expressly referred to in that Houseâ€”it was strongly denied and disclaimed by a noble baron ( lord Grenville ) then holding a high situation in the government , who denied that such a fact had ever taken place . With respect to the idea held by the noble baron , of his proneness to consult those whose interests were so immediately concerned , he had to state , he felt it incumbent on him , not only in the case of the bank of England , but of any other public body whose interests 325 were deeply implicated , to endeavour to learn whether important objections were entertained , and where these were communicated , he always exercised his own judgment how far such constituted a fit ground for objection or argument in parliamentary discussion . presented a Petition from several manufacturers of china and earthenware in the Staffordshire potteries ; setting forth , `` That the Staffordshire potteries , containing originally but few inhabitants , and possessing little except the rude productions of nature , have , by the skill and industry of the potters , become the seat of manufactories of national importance , giving support to a considerable population , and supplying tonnage to a great amount for the coasting trade and for inland navigation in the conveyance of raw materials , the products of Cornwall , Devon , Dorset , Kent , Derbyshire , and Wales , and in the transport of a bulky manufactured article ; and that in time of peace , the productions of these manufactories found their way to all parts of the known world , but since the commencement of the present unexampled system of commercial warfare , they have experienced , in common with the others in the United Kingdom , the privations unavoidably produced by a total exclusion from the continent of Europe ; and that restricted as the Petitioners were , by the severe prohibiting decrees of the enemy , from any participation in the continental trade of Europe , it became of the highest importance to preserve our extensive and valuable commerce with the United States of America , by every means consistent with our national honour and interest ; and they humbly conceive that the Orders in Council issued in 1807 , and continued in certain of their provisions in an Order of 1809 , were intended to force a commercial communication with the continent of Europe from the pressure of its necessities , but instead of producing 330 that effect , they are manifestly the cause of still further curtailing our trade , by depriving us of the market of the United States of America , the only one of importance which was left open to us ; and that notwithstanding the Berlin Decree our trade with the United States was as flourishing as at any former period until the Orders in Council were issued , followed by the American embargo and Non-Importation laws ; and , when the Petitioners consider the naval superiority of this country , they can not suppose it would have been interrupted by that Decree , or by any other within the power of the enemy ; and that it is with the most painful anxiety the Petitioners find themselves compelled to represent the present depressed and alarming state of their trade , the number of bankruptcies is unprecedented , more than one fifth of our manufactories are unoccupied and falling to decay , and the remainder , many of which are at work on the prospect of the opening of the American market , are employed on the average to little more than half their usual extent , great numbers of workmen are without employment , and they and their families are dependent upon our daily increasing poor rates for subsistence ; and praying the House to take such measures as to them shall seem meet , to relieve the distresses of the country
