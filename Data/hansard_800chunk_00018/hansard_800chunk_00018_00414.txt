expect that whenever we seriously undertake the great work of national conciliation , there will be little difficulty in forming an arrangement upon this subject , equivalent in substance , however differing in form , which may not be deemed inexpedient to the Catholics . It is no doubt desirable either in this or any other country , that the government should have the means of providing that disloyal men should not be placed in situations of influence and power . This judgment , with respect to all civil and military 834 offices , would of course be exercised by government in regard to Catholics , as it now is in regard to Protestants . No Catholic would be promoted in the army or any other profession , unless he were a good citizen ; and when it is said that without the Veto or some equivalent , the government would have no controul over the nomination of their bishops , I reply , that they have now no controul over their nomination ; and if they were disposed to use their influence disloyally , which they are not , as was shewn by their exemplary conduct in the two recent rebellions , they might address it to much more willing ears , than they could do , if you removed these sources of jealousy and discontent . When this subject has been formerly agitated , I have abstained from slating my opinion upon it , partly from a general unwillingness to trouble the House at any time with the sentiments of so unimportant an individual , and partly from a feeling , that although if the petitioners chose to bring it under the view of parliament , it was impossible to withhold that vote which a sincere and strong opinion suggested , no success , however , could under the then existing circumstances , be anticipated for the measure in parliament , and that consequently , other and mora favourable opportunities would occur for expressing that opinion , both with respect to the general principle , and to the details which must be considered in its progress . The subject , however , comes now under our consideration in very different circumstances . We can not be opposed in parliament , nor can a flame be excited in the country , by the conscientious scruples of the Prince Regent ; and no one except the learned doctor has urged the invented impediments of the coronation oath . Of his Majesty I am unwilling to speak other-wise than with that delicacy and respect which is due to his misfortunes and to his virtues ; but I can not help remarking , that it is an extraotdinary circumstance in the history of this nation , that the opinion of an individual whose mind has been for twenty-five years constantly liable to the slighter or stronger affections of that disorder under which it now labours , and who we now know has exercised the sovereign authority whilst under its influence , and surrounded by the restraints which it renders necessary , should have had the weight which we know it has had on the public mind in deciding upon the political destinies of four millions 835 of the subjects of this empire . But that day is now past , and the time arrived , which the Catholics , however loyal , however attached to the person , and admiring the virtues of the sovereign , could not but look forward to with the satisfactory anticipation of the fulfilment of those hopes in which they had been encouraged by the Prince of Wales . I abstain from alluding to any rumoured difference of opinion between himself and his present counsellors ; because such difference can not be recognized by parliament , and because it is from responsible ministers only that we can collect the feelings and judgment of the sovereign . I will not imitate in this respect the conduct of the present government , who have formerly most improperly applied the name and personal influence of the King to their political purposes upon this subject . But of the avowed opinions
