man alone is that sacred bar held inseparable and inviolate which the law has interposed between the Petitioners and the 370 attainment of their wishes ; and that here they hope they shall be indulged in adducing , as a crowning proof of the tenets and practice of their ancient faith , the sublime example of its spiritual head , the suffering and magnanimous Pius , who stands an illustrious monument of glory to his religion , and of shame to many Christian princes ; on him humiliations have been heaped , and the cup of bitterness impotently exhausted ; immovable in conscious rectitude , he alone has defied the vengeance of a ruthless power , and , as be came the great minister of peace , refused to join a confederacy leagued for the overthrow of these kingdoms ; his despoiler they may confidently maintain will meet little countenance or partiality from Catholic Ireland ; and that the Petitioners will not stoop further to repel these calumnies , which even their propagators do not believe , but they refer with complacency , to the solemn recognition of their meritorious demeanor by their own parliament , when it first invited them to the threshold of the constitution , a measure wise and salutary at the time , but doubly grateful as a spontaneous emanation from the royal breast ; the benign and parental source , they are proud to acknowledge , of numerous other gracious favours ; and with equal pleasure do the Petitioners appeal to the honourable and decisive testimony of their Protestant fellow citizens , whose just discernment has long obliterated , in society , the partial demarcations of the law ; with them the Petitioners are blended in all the sympathies of private life and communion of dearest interests ; they would open wide , and hail as reason 's triumph , their unqualified admission to the sanctuary of British freedom , for to them they have amply proved how deeply they have imbibed , and how prepared they are to vindicate its principles ; they witnessed and they cheered their late assertion , constitutional they trust , and authorized of that radical provision of its guardian law , the right they at this moment exercise of addressing the House ; and the Petitioners therefore feel warranted respectfully , but most earnestly , to impress on the wisdom of the House the policy of cherishing those elements of harmony and conciliation , which will unite in consentaneous impulse all the energies of the state , will elect for their rulers , in the bosoms of enfranchised Irishmen , a temple of ever lasting gratitude , and impart vigour to the arm , and ardour to the heart , of every in 371 dividual of this nation ; the time and talent too they consume in complaint will be de voted , unfettered and undivided to the common cause ; and that it is reserved , the Petitioners presume to hope , for the House , and it is worthy the character of enlightened statesmen , to redeem at length the great name of the British empire from the disparaging imputation of sacrificing an eternal principle of justice , and a commanding maxim of legislation , to a passing expediency and to fleeting events ; and praying the House , in this crisis of unprecedented emergency , to hearken to the monitory voice of those great luminaries of their councils , whose discerning patriotism has identified their cause with the security of these realms , and who have exhorted the House , as they contemplate a successful resistance to our inveterate foe , to make a brave and gallant people happy in the possession , and invincible under the banners of the British constitution , by the repeal of those laws so manifestly hostile to its genuine spirit .
