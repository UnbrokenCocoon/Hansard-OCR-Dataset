the means of accurately observing the effects of protracted war and restricted commerce ; in ascertaining those effects , it will be sufficient for them to state the high price of all the necessaries of life , the unparalleled and long-continued reduction of wages , the frequent interruptions of labour , the consequent difficulty of obtaining a bare subsistence , the rapid advancement of parochial rates , the increasing deficiencies in . the collection of assessed taxes , the exhaustion of the little stores by which the more laborious and provident formerly hoped to obtain a trifling elevation above absolute poverty , the gradual disappearance of the middling classes , which are fast melting down into the lower orders of the community , and the certain prospect of evil still more injurious to the individual sufferers , and to the interests of the country at large ; these are some of the consequences of that state of things which is so poignantly to be deplored , and the causes and removal of which , the Peti- 95 tioners pray that the House will take into immediate and dispassionate consideration ; in thus adverting to the afflictive privations of the poor , the Petitioners by no means wish it to be inferred that they are the only sufferers ; it must be obvious to the House , that the unprecedented number of failures and bankruptcies in the higher departments of commercial society , and in all its descending gradations , are immediately owing to those causes , which , in their ultimate but severest operation , affect the labouring and mechanical classes ; they could easily amplify this general statement by a minute detail of painful events ; but the members of the House are sufficiently acquainted with the numerous and increasing accumulation of facts in support of the account which has been presented ; what those causes are to which evils of such enormity and magnitude may be traced , it is not difficult to ascertain ; the Petitioners submit that they may be discovered in the impolicy which suggested , adopted , and still continues un-revoked , the Orders in Council , in the absence of conciliatory measures towards the United States , and in the want of clear , prompt , and satisfactory explanations in diplomatic negociations with that country ; but they are imperiously compelled to specify what , in their apprehensions , is the primary cause of their sufferings ; as natives of a country professing the Christian religion , they deplore the moral effects of war ; as men , they lament the miseries of their fellow-creatures ; as Britons , they feel convinced that war is inimical to their interests ; that its continuance is more injurious to a commercial country , like our own , than to one which possesses , within itself , greater physical resources ; that the subjugation of the enemy is more impracticable than ever ; and that his power is more firmly compacted by the opposition he has encountered ; supported by these facts , in the opinions they form of the consequences of the present war , the Petitioners fuel the most urgent solicitude , arising from convictions which are every day confirmed and increased , that the House should direct its attention to the revocation of those decrees , which , in imitation of an enemy 's policy , have accomplished the object of that policy instead of their own , and which , by their continuance , present the main obstacle to the amicable adjustment of differences with America ; they also submit , that the restrictions by which 96 the East India trade has been limited to an individual incorporation , in the metropolis of the kingdom , should be annihilated when the present period of its mono-poly shall expire , and that , on the principles of liberal economy , the advantages of that trade should be enjoyed without exclusion or limitation ; but they especially entreat that measures towards the pacification of Europe may become the subjects of the immediate deliberation of the House , who will thus obtain a truly dignified
