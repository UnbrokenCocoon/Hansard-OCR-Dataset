Why should there be any Not conscious of any inferiority in their devotion to the interests of the state , and knowing themselves free from any insidious purposes against other descriptions of their fellow subjects , they can not suppose any deficiency in their title to the amplest enjoyment of British immunities . Should any one assert that such an unrestricted admission would affect the security of existing establishments , it is for him to make out his proposition . The burthen of shewing the danger must equitably rest upon him . Let him state his case , connecting his indication of the peril , with some fact or probability capable of being seized and fairly discussed . Loose and general imputations drawn from the extravagant supposition that the Irish Catholics of the present day are just 658 what Catholics were a century and a half ago , can never be the ground of any profitable deliberation . As little can you rationally argue to the principles of the Catholic body from doctrines which any absurd and unauthorised advocate may have happened to publish . Take the distinct unambiguous declaration made by the leading men of that communion in Ireland , as speaking for the whole body , and supported by the subsequent concurrence of that body . Refer to that , and see if it leave room for the impeachment which the Catholics are desired , by a limitation of their claims , to put upon their loyalty to their sovereign and their fidelity to their fellow subjects . Do not tax their ingenuity to devise against themselves flaws foreign to their natures . It is enough if you undertake that office : their minds are not cast in a mould that fits them for comprehending such suspicions. `` I would grant them every indulgence '' says the noble and learned lord ( a sentiment re-echoed by a noble earl ) that did not invest them with political power . '' I should like much to hear political power defined . At present I take it to be just as loose an expression as Catholic Emancipation on the other side , expressing nothing but a sort of confused imagination that there may be inconvenience in admitting the Catholics to all the right * of citizenship . Is it meant that in parliament , or in the active offices of the state , the Catholics would obtain a preponderance formidable for the Protestant establishment . No , we may assert that not an individual could be found so visionary as to avow that notion . Then the apprehensions must be some floating conception that advancement to higher stations than they can now hold would give to the leading members of that communion an-influence over the body of Catholics in Ireland which they do not now possess . Consult your own knowledge of human nature , my lords , and determine upon the quality of this apprehension . What the giving to the Catholic of rank an interest unconnected with the objects of the majority of persons of his communionâ€”the withdrawing him from confraternity with them in privations and neglect , is to furnish him with a more powerful title to their confidence and sympathy ! The supposition needs only to be slated to be repelled by-the judgment of every man . Is it not clear that the Catholic of birth , or of property , if he be commixed with the 659 active pursuits of high life , must have less leisure and less excitement than at present to address himself to the passions of his sect . Then , admitting that , contrary to all probability , no jealousy should arise in their minds respecting an individual whom they see identified by office or profession with that Protestant government represented as the mark for their unremitting hostility , are his practices likely to make most impression upon minds soured with insult , or upon minds soothed by obliteration of invidious distinctions ? Can the artifices of a demagogue in elevated employment be more commodiously exerted upon a multitude blended with the rest of their fellow citizens , than when
