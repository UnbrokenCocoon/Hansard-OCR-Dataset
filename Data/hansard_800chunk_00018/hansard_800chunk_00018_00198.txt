sort as most unconstitutional , as an attempt to disguise from parliament the real sentiments of the Protestants of Ireland , upon the subject of the claims of their Catholic fellow-subjects . The Petition was then brought up and read ; setting forth , `` That , contemplating the warning fate of surrounding nations , and the fearful disparity of our physical means in the vital conflict in which we are engaged , the Petitioners respectfully express , as they deeply feel , a serious and surely not irrational apprehension of the result , unless the legislature in its wisdom shall hasten to oppose an effectual counterpoise to the mighty power now wielded with such rancorous hostility for our destruction ; and this great object , it appears to the Petitioners , can only be achieved , by calling into instantaneous action , and combining , ill protection of these threatened realms , every vigorous and quickening impulse , all the elements of generous and moral feeling that can animate and exalt the human breast ; and yet , amidst the crowding terrors of these days , in a war emphatically distinguished as a war of principle , when an enlightened policy would be anxious to communicate the equal benefits , in order to infuse the unconquered spirit of freedom , the Petitioners behold , with concern and dismay , a vast majority of the population of this land still degraded and discouraged ; above four millions of a gallant and loyal people are summoned to 369 shed their blood in support of a constitution which unnerves the hand raised in its defence , by intercepting its fair reward , and checks the aspiration of their genius by the opposition of ungenerous barriers to its course ; they are precluded from numerous offices of trust and honour , the objects and incentives of a noble emulation , though to many of these the more favoured alien is invited at home , and all are open , with the concurrence of the House , to the newly conquered Catholic subject abroad ; the native Catholic alone , as if marked by the reprobating stamp of nature , is pronounced unworthy of making his services , in every station , acceptable to his sovereign , or useful to his country ; and that these proscriptive statutes , the Petitioners lament to say , have transplanted from their natural soil the talents and fortunes of many an able statesman and valiant soldier ; born to diffuse lustre on their own , and compelled to promote the glories of another land ; the Petitioners claim , as their kindred , while they deplore to their country , the loss of many names of renown in foreign annals , and on the present great theatre of war , they trace , in some of the most distinguished actors , the blood and spirit of banished Irishmen ; and that still a system , so injurious in its operation , generated in times and under circumstances of which the very shadow has passed away , is , they blush to add , attempted to be justified by imputations aspersive of their morality as Christians , and allegiance as subjects , their enemies , and the enemies of the edifice , would fain blot from the page of history , and from the recollection of the House ; that to their Catholic ancestors , Britons are mainly indebted for the transcendent blessings of their constitution ; they laid the firmest basis of the empire ; and it surely is an ungenerous retribution to their memory to make the creed they professed a title of exclusion from the more perfect fabric ; that religion , they are bound to infer , could inculcate nothing dangerous to society or prejudicial to the state , the sole and paramount sway of which was owned by those men who first defined the grand outlines of our civil rights , and the influence of which , at the present day , subjects the master passions of our nature , even interest and ambition , to the controul of conscience ; by moral
