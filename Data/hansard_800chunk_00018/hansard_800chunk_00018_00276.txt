and the history of the progress of this question in the sister country , this House can not be unprepared , for changes of opinions somewhat sudden , in those who are now at the head of the Regent 's councils . Let me remind a noble earl , ( the earl of Buckinghamshire ) who has been lately added to the confidential servants of the government , and the noble earl ( the earl of Westmoreland ) in the blue ribband , of whose administration in Ireland he had made a part , of the proceedings in that kingdom in 1792 , and 1793 , compared or rather contrasted with each other . The rejection of the petition of the Catholics , in the House of Commons of Ireland , in 1792 , for only a limited elective franchise , by the noble earl , at the head of a triumphant majority , pledges of lives and fortunes , for the perpetual exclusion of the Catholics , by every corporation throughout the kingdom , great and small , in which the ever obsequious corporation of the city of Dublin took the lead , but , unfortunately for the public , did not stand then , as it does now , the solitary example of intolerance , the miserable object of ministerial 512 power . A Petition , notwithstanding all this , from a representative body of the Catholics , elected by all the Catholics of Ireland , sitting in the metropolis for many days , found its way to the foot of the throne , although the two noble earls , who then administered the Irish government , would not suffer it to pass through the regular official channel . The memorable session of 1793 , opened with a speech from the throne , delivered by the noble earl in the blue ribband , strongly recommending to the parliament the Catholic Claims , and the elective franchise , unlimited and entire , and all the valuable concessions of the act of 1793 , restored to the Catholics , by a Bill , introduced into parliament by the other noble earl , and backed by all the influence of his Majesty 's government . The obsequious Commons of Ireland , among whom , in the preceding year , forty-five were only found , who did not pledge themselves against the grant of any further concessions to their Catholic countrymen , now and for ever , inspired on the sudden with extraordinary sentiments of kindness and liberality ; the intolerance of the petty corporations abashed and put down , and by the timely and discreet recantation of the Irish parliament , and the wisdom and firmness of a noble viscount ( Melville ) now no more , then the Secretary of State for the Home Department , and to whose memory , for this just and merciful act of his administration , I shall always look as to that of a great public benefactor , the important conciliation of 179S , accomplished , without a struggle . So much for pledges , so much for consistency , so much for that infuriate religious phrenzy , which outstrips and insults reason ; which is not the child of our understanding , but the offspring of our worst passions ; which is not real , but affected ; which is provoked , and excited , but not natural ; which hypocrisy assumes , and interest deposes ; which a tender heart could not feel , and an honest one would not practise . But every former relaxation of the penal code , in favour of the Irish Catholics , from 1778 , when their situation first engaged the attention of parliament , to the period of the great concessions of 1793 , was in every instance , the measure of the ministers of the crown , recommended on the last memorable occasion , by the king 's representative , in his speech from the 513 throne . And it was particularly fit and becoming , that so signal an instance of justice and mercy to his suffering subjects , should proceed from the
