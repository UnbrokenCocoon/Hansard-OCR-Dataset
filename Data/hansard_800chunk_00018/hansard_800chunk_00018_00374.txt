the understanding , as they suppose , of lord Fingall or sir Edward Bellew , has no effect on these foreigners , and why they abandon their prejudices in favour of strangers , and advance them only to proscribe the natives of their own country . They will tell you that the disqualifying oath is a fundamental part of the Act of Union ; desire them to read the Act of Union ; 743 they will there find the disqualifying oath is directly the contrary ; that by the fourth article of the Union , it is expressly declared to be provisionary , not fundamental , and you may add , that herein is a provision by act of parliament , declaring that the excluding oath , as prescribed at the Revolution , is not a fundamental part of the constitution . The same declaration will be found in the Scotch Union . Thus all the parliaments of these realms have repeatedly declared , that the disqualifying oath is not a fundamental part of the constitution , and therefore against the argument of the minister on this head you may quote the two Acts of Union , and also the authority of those who voted for the Irish Act of Union , that is to say some of the ministers themselves , and also of those who drew up the Irish Act of Union , who , I apprehend , were some of themselves ; ask them , have they set forth in this act of parliament , that the disqualifying oath was provisionary , and after obtaining the Union , will they now belie their own law , and assert that the oath is fundamental ; they will tell you , that by the constitution of the country , the parliament is Protestant ; ask them , are not the Commons a part of parliament , and are not the Irish electors a part of the Commons , and are not they in no small a proportion Catholic ; the persons who argue with you thus against the Catholics , have sworn the oath at your table ; desire them to read it , and there they will find no profession of faith whatever , that Christianity itself is no part of the qualification . That any man can take that oath except a Catholic . Ask them whether that exclusion was not on account of political combinations formerly existing in Europe ; ask them whether they continue ; and in answer to all their objections and jealousy , ask them why they continue to fill their navy and army in such an immense proportion , with men whose race they affect to distrust , and therefore they presume to disqualify . Ask the generals and admirals bow these men act in the fleet and in the field ; read the lists of the killed and wounded , and see in what number these men have died in your service ; read the Irish names of wounded officers ; recollect that they can not be generals , and see in their practical allegiance a complete answer to all objections . Or , if you wish for further information , do not apply to the court , but ask the 744 country ; ask the Protestant gentlemen of Ireland ; ask the house of Leinster ; ask the house of Ormond ; ask the great landed proprietors of the country , men who must stand the brunt of the danger ; ask their Petition ; and do not in the face of their opinion decide against the civil privileges of a fourth of your own people ; do not hazard the name of England on such a principle ; do not hazard the empire of England on such an experiment . I appeal to the hospitals , who are thronged with the Irish who have been disabled in your cause , and to the fields of Spain and Portugal , yet drenched with their blood , and I turn from that policy which disgraces your empire , to the spirit of civil freedom that formed it ; that is the
