the reverse of what he now recommended . He was sure , if consistency were to be found in any individual , his noble friend could not object to the adoption of a similar course on the present occasion . must protest against any comparison of the importance of the question in 1793 , and at the present period . At that time there did not exist that great , immense , and extensive difference of opinion which now evidently existed . The question then was , whether it were proper to continue , for a limited time , the system then in existence . At present the strongest difference was manifested , as appeared by the numerous Petitions and applications to the legislature from every part of the country . Those who , on the former occasion , were of opinion that no change ought to be made , might have considered the period of the session at which they came forward , abundantly sufficient for agitating the operation ; in that point of view might , on the same principle , now consider a similar period for discussion totally insufficient . Whatever the difference of opinion might be upon almost all other points , they were all decided that a great and effectual change must take place in the whole system ; a consideration which would bear no comparison with the mere question of continuance . But there was another consideration which it was impossible any noble lord could overlook , namely , that which was presented by a view of the distresses of the country , by the cries and lamentations of their fellow subjects for opening new markets , when the trade and commerce of the country were in the lowest and most distressed situation ever knownâ€”a situation to which the weak and wretched policy of ministers had reduced them . said he must be allowed to observe , that there was no disposition whatever , nor any reason to suppose there was , on the part of the King 's servants , to avoid any course of proceeding that would give to parliament and to the country the fullest opportunities of deliberating on the subject in question . Even if the course adverted to was adopted , it would still be at the option of any noble lord to bring forward any of the great branches of the subject under separate discussion . With respect to what was said of the occasion in 1793 , if he were not mistaken , there were also at that time the strongest representations from all the manufacturing towns , soliciting that the trade might then be thrown open to the country at large ; and an arrangement had been proposed , by which it was thought that considerable benefits in the way of trade might be derived by individuals 1080 through the medium of the Company . He was far from being insensible to all the difficulties and dangers of the present moment ; but this was the first time he ever heard the year 1793 pointed out as one of great prosperity . On the contrary , it might be doubted , whether there was ever a period in which the universal commercial distresses of the country were greater than at that very period . contended , that a great and striking difference existed in the state of the question at present , and at the period of 1793 . They had not then , as now , a prospect of India being a burthen upon the finances of the country . A noble marquis , then in his eye , had most ably demonstrated the great benefits which would result from a free trade to India ; the military and political parts of the question also constituted an essential difference . Neither was there any comparison between the state of this country at the period alluded to and at the present time . observed , that ministers continued to say , that there was every disposition on their part that this most important subject should have the fullest discussion , but still they delayed bringing forward
