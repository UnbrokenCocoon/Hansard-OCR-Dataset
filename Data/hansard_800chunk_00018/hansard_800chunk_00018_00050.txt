elevation in being the first to sheathe the sword when no object of utility can be effected , when war can be no longer subservient to that which is its only legitimate object , the security of peace ; the House will thus obtain at least a temporary cessation to the miseries and distractions of a bleeding world , they will excite afresh the powerful energies of a commercial people , they will furnish employment and subsistence lo an immense population at home , they will give stability and consolidation to our colonial dependencies abroad , they will raise the tone of national character in the estimation of surrounding countries , and connect the remembrance of our pacific achievements with the gratitude and attachment of millions for whose weal they legislate , and whose prosperity is inseparably combined with our own ; the Petitioners are aware that an appeal to the feelings of sensibility , or the power of imagination , would be incongruous , but they humbly solicit the attention of the House to higher and more definite principles ; and that before the evils which now press so severely on the various classes of society are extended and multiplied beyond the possibility of endurance , the Petitioners beseech the House to investigate their causes , to ascertain the effectual means of counteraction , and , from motives of policy , patriotism , and justice , to administer the appropriate remedies . '' requested that the noble lord who had the conduct of the measure , would put off the second reading until Monday , in order to give an opportunity for a right hon . friend of his ( Mr. Sheri- 97 dan ) who was indisposed , to be present at the discussion . replied , that he did not feel authorised to postpone the second reading of the Bill , and must therefore move that the Bill be now read a second time . rose to give his decided negative to the motion .
