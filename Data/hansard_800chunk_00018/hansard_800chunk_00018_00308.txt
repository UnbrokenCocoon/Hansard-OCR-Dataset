were founded ; there you may examine what laws have been enacted ; bow those laws have been altered , or mitigated : ultimately you may enquire , what is the present state of them ; and when you have the whole question before you , you may examine this great fundamental and important doctrine , whether the Protestant establishment is best supported by civil restraints , penalties , and exclusions , or , by a system of peace and 628 of charity , consistent with the mildness of our religion , with the true spirit and principle of the Revolution , with the character of our liberty , and the parental spirit of this great state . —My lords ; my noble friend has commenced his speech , by calling on your lordships , whatever may be the ultimate decision of this question , to go into a committee upon the subject . My lords , my view of the subject is so different from that of my noble friend in every point , that I have no difficulty in saying , that upon every view which I could take of the question , the motion of the noble lord opposite would have my decided negative . My lords , I certainly do not wish nor desire any person , who may be of opinion that out of such a Committee benefit would arise , to withhold any wish of their '' upon that subject , But , my lords , I do say , as my own confident opinion , that from a motion such as this , under all the circumstances of the case , in the present state of the country , and in the present temper of the Catholics , no benefit whatever is likely to arise ; but on the contrary , and it is in that view that I oppose this question , taking into consideration the temper and disposition of the parties , the adoption of this motion would be only calculated to alarm the established Church , and ultimately to disappoint the Catholics : and therefore I shall agree in the proposition for giving this question a decided negative . My noble friend has gone into a long and laborious detail upon this subject ; but I confess , that if his argument was true , if his view of the question was right , I would think he had less reason for voting to go into a Committee than almost any person ; because , if his view was true , if the danger of refusing these concessions was as great as he represents , and the danger of granting was so little , the true mode would be to resolve at once into a measure for repealing of these tests and disabilities , and put an end to all deliberation that might be necessary upon the subject . The view which my noble friend had taken of this subject is certainly a very extended one , and , my lords , I will endeavour to follow him through the different grounds which he has taken ; and if I misrepresent any opinion of his , or do not state it correctly , he will dome the justice to believe that I have not done it wilfully . 629 I am extremely anxious that any point I which is at issue between us should be ascertained with care ; but on any point where no difference does exist , I shall be willing to concur with my noble friend . My lords , without going at present into that part of the subject which formed the commencement of his speech—without entering into any detail of how far religious establishments are , or are not , necessary to 8 state—how far they constitute the main object of a state , compared with other essential objects , I do not feel it necessary now to discuss , because I believe we shall all agree that religious establishments do form a most essential and important part of the government and interest of every civilized stale . My lords , I do subscribe to
