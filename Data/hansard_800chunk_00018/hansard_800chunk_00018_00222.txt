unbind the fetters imposed upon religious dissent , the Roman Catholics of Ireland have remained unrelieved ; and that the laws , which unequivocally attest their innocence and their merits , continue to load them with the pains of guilt ; their own consciences , the voice of mankind , acquit them of crime and offence ; their Protestant fellow citizens press forward , with generous ardour and enlightened benevolence , to testify their earnest wishes for their relief ; yet these penal laws , of which they humbly complain , cherish the spirit of hostility , and impede the cordial union of the people , which is at all times so desirable , and now so necessary and that 405 these penal laws operate for no useful or meritorious purpose , affording no aid to the constitution in church or state ; not attaching affection to either , they are efficient only for objects of disunion and disaffection ; they separate the Protestant from the Catholic , and withdraw both from the public good ; they irritate man against his fellow creature , alienate the subject from the state , and leave the Roman Catholic community but a precarious and imperfect protection , as the reward of fixed and unbroken allegiance ; and that the Petitioners forbear to detail the numerous incapacities and inconveniences inflicted by those laws , directly or indirectly , upon the Roman Catholic community , or to dwell upon the humiliating and ignominious system of exclusion , reproach , and suspicion which they generate and keep alive ; perhaps no other age or nation has ever witnessed severities more vexatious , or inflictions more taunting , than those which the Petitioners have long endured , and of which but too large a portion still remains ; and that relief from these disabilities and penalties they have sought through every channel that has appeared to them to be legitimate and eligible ; they have never consciously violated , or sought to violate , the known laws of the land , nor have they pursued their object in any other manner than such as has been usually adhered to , and apparently the best calculated to collect and communicate their united sentiments accurately , without tumult , and to obviate all pretext for asserting , that the Roman Catholic , community at large were indifferent to the pursuit of their freedom ; and they can affirm , with perfect sincerity , that they have no latent views to realize , no secret or sinister objects to attain ; any such imputation must be effectually repelled , as they humbly conceive , by the consideration of their numbers , their property , and their known principles and character ; and that their object is avowed and direct , earnest yet natural ; it extends to an equal participation of the civil rights of the constitution of their country equally with their fellow subjects of all other religious persuasions ; it extends no further ; and that they would cheerfully concede the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty to all mankind ; they ask no more for themselves ; they seek not the possession of offices , but mere eligibility to office , in common with their fellow citizens ; not power or ascendancy over any class of 406 people , but the bare permission to rise from their prostrate posture , and to stand erect in the empire ; and that they have been taught that , according to the pure and practical principles of the British constitution , property is justly entitled to a proportionate share of power ; and they humbly trust , that no reasonable apprehension can arise from that power which can only be obtained and exerciser through the constitution ; and they are sensible , and they do not regret , that this equality of civil rights , which alone they humbly sue for , will leave a fair practical ascendancy wheresoever property shall predominate ; but , whilst they acknowledge the wholesomeness of this great principle , they can not admit the necessity of the unqualified disfranchisement of any part of the
