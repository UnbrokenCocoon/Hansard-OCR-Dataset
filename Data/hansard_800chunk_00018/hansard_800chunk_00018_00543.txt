precarious commercial advantage . From the moment at which these were given up we should suffer most severely in our trade . The instant these Orders in Council were repealed , the ports of almost all the world would be thrown open to France , to furnish her with raw materials necessary to carrying on her manufactures . The whole French manufactures of last year , of every kind whatever , amounted in value only to 54 millions of livres . This was entirely owing to their not being able to procure raw materials . It was well known that France had a very flourishing cotton , woollen and silk manufacture before the war . Now , if the ports of France were to be open , she would receive cotton from Brazil , and other parts of South America . It was true there was at present a duty on the importation of cotton into France almost amounting to a prohibition . This 1101 duty was continued , because the emperor of `` France knew very well that cotton could now be manufactured only for home consumption , and he was careless what duty was laid on , as it would all be paid by his own subjects . But the moment the ports of France were opened , the French would be able to meet us on our own ground . America would be the carrier , and France would have the means of sending her manufactures to Brazil and ail South America—she would be easily enabled to do this from her large population . Now what would those who were so strenuous advocates for our trade say to this ? —That the commodities of Birmingham , and other manufacturing towns , would find an immediate vent and a considerable market he did not deny , but it was necessary to consider what would be the consequence to our trade in other respects ; —what effect it would have ultimately on our trade to other parts.—The trade at present carried on with the north of Europe , amounted in the last year to 18,500,000l . being 1,000,000l . more than its amount in 1806 , and he had the satisfaction to state , that within the last eight weeks it had been increasing 100,000l . per week on what it was at the corresponding period in the last year . Was this then the time at which we should risk the whole of this trade ? The exports to America had formerly amounted to about 12 millions annually . Of this about half had been carried on on account of foreign colonial settlements . The fair consumption of the United Slates might then be taken to have been six millions . In the last year our exports to the United States were 2 millions . In 1805 , their amount was 11,500,000l . In 1800 , and 1807 , 12 millions . In 1808 , they fell to 5,300,000l . His opinion had been , that as the trade fell off with the United States , it would increase with other parts of America ; and this opinion had been borne out for three years , as the exports to other parts had increased from 11,000,000l . to 18,000,000l . in 1808 . In 1809 they were nearly the same ; and in 1810 , they amounted to 17,000,000l . In the last year ( 1811 ) , they had however again fallen to 11,803,000l . the exports of the United Slates being but 2,000,000l . So that if we could get over the great stumbling block , the Orders in Council , and the trade of America were again open to us , all we ought to expect was , that our exports to the United States would be raised from 2,000,000l . to 6,000,000l . 1102 annually . If , however , we suffered a loss of 4,000,000l . from the want of an open trade to America , what did America suffer herself ? —From a paper which had been presented to congress by Mr. Gallatin , it appeared that her exports in 1810–1811 amounted
