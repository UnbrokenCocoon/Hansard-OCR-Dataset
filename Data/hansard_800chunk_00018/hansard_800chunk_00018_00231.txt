on the most evident considerations of justice ; and they trust that the compliance of the state would yet conciliate the affection of millions of their aggrieved fellow subjects , and unite them for ever to the interests of the empire : under each of these aspects their request claims , and they hope will be found to deserve , the assent of the House , as they are statesmen anxious for the safety of their country , and as they are moralists determined to act impartially on the rules of justice ; but , when the Petitioners consider farther , 420 that every attempt to influence men in their choice and profession of religion by penal laws , whether corrupt or compulsive in their operation , is contrary to the spirit of the gospel , and forbidden by its plainest precepts in numerous pasages , they hope it may be allowed them more particularly , and with all possible eereestness , to intreat the serious and sincere Christians in the House to interpose their endeavours , not only to vindicate the Gospel from the groundless charge of intolerance , but to influence this Christian state to conform its laws for the protection of the Established Church , to the purity , benignity , and exalted integrity of the religion of the Gospel , to renounce the whole system of persecution , the long accumulation of ages of barbarism and discord , and to free an almost countless multitude of injured individuals from the temptation of ensnaring tests , and the more oppressive severities of compulsive intolerance ; by the success of such salutary counsels , at once restoring concord and safety to the empire , and freeing our national Church from the just reproach of retaining that support which persecuting laws can bestow , but which Christianity condemns , and would disdain to accept .

Being now on his legs , however , he begged leave to state , that unless the decision of the court of King's-bench on a case now pending before them , should render the thing unnecessary , he should submit to the House a motion on a subject not altogether unconnected with religious toleration . It had hither to been supposed , that it was required of magistrates to tender the oaths to persons wishing to qualify for preaching or teaching , who tendered themselves . This had hitherto been , considered to be the law , but it was 421 now alleged that it was not so , and a more limited interpretation was now wished to be given to the enactment of the statute . If the court of King's-bench should decide in favour of this more limited construction , he gave notice , that he should , on the 29th of April , bring forward a proposition for making that which was the more liberal interpretation , the legal interpretation also . presented a Petition from the commercial and manufacturing inhabitants of Dudley . He said he felt it his duty , in presenting this Petition , to state to the House , that in the populous neighbourhood of Dudley there was at this moment the greatest distress prevailing , from the very high price of provisions ; that the higher classes of manufacturers in that town and neigbourhood had on all occasions evinced their loyalty and patriotism , and from
