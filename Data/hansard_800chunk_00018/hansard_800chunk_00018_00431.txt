find none ; for so far from offering any security for the protection of the Established Church , they obstinately withhold even those securities which they were formerly ready to concede . I have heard of the necessity of securities guaranteed by the most enlightened advocate of this cause , and offered by the petitioners ; but these they now retract . I have looked at this question , so important , in a view to our political and religious interests : I have observed the disposition of the parties urging these claims , and I own that I see nothing on their parts which appears like a disposition to afford proper securities to the Established Church . On the contrary , they seem to me to be anxious , not only for the unconditional attainment of civil privileges and power in the state , but also to gain for their religion a marked and public encouragement . What then is the duty of those who wish well to the established religion ? Will it not be for them to consider whether this marked and public encouragement to the Catholics may not operate as a marked and public discouragement to the Established Church ? There was a time , Sir , and not many-years ago , when it was held in this country to be a fundamental principle of civil polity , that where a religious establishment is formed consistent with the general principles of the nation , such an establishment should be supported with the utmost tenacity , as the basis , upon which rests the security of the stale ; but we are now told that such notions are quite obsolete—that there should be no religious distinctions whatever , no peculiar protection to the Established Church , while , at other times , though the propriety of a peculiar protection was admitted , it was at the same time gravely contended , that this protection might very safely be entrusted to persons of a very different faith . Now , Sir , I would ask gentlemen whether they seriously think a Roman Catholic chancellor , Roman Catholic privy counsellors , or Roman Catholic legislators , could be considered as faithful guardians to the Protestant religion in this country ? I do not mean to put this question with any purpose of irritating the feelings of gen- 864 tlemen , as I do admit that there are many persons of the Catholic persuasion , who are men of great private worth , but I can not withhold my own opinion , that if the Catholics are true to the principles of their faith , there is nothing which they can have more at heart than the complete extinction of the Protestant religion , and when I look to the genius of the Catholic religion , the exclusive spirit which universally pervades it—when I look at its general doctrines , that salvation is not to be had out of the pale of its Church , I can not contemplate , without alarm , the admission of the Roman Catholics as the guardians of a Protestant establishment . It may as well be asserted , that the Church would be as safe in the hands devoted to its destruction , as under the guardianship of those devoted to its protection . Seeing , therefore , Sir , no possibility of acceding to such a principle , I have the strongest objection to going into the proposed committee . It has been stated , that the Presbyterians of the Church of Scotland are hostile to the established religion , and yet are admitted into the highest offices of the state ; but yet , Sir , I think this argument has no bearing upon the question , nor is it any-fair ground to shew that the Presbyterians may not safely be trusted , for there is a principle of union amongst the Protestant sects in all their varieties , which must be friendly to a Protestant establishment ; whereas the Roman Catholics , if they hold the sentiments professed for them by their own most approved authors , they must be anxious
