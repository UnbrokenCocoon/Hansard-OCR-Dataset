to secure and enhance all their blessings , by sharing them with their countrymen . Now , when the Protestants themselves presented the olive branch , and were for healing those wounds which a wicked policy had studiously inflicted , there were not wanting those who would prevent the accomplishment of this great and good work ; and in the face of the evidence afforded by the Petition , would anxiously conceal from the parliament and the throne , the actual state of the public mind in Ireland . I will not undertake to say the exact proportion of Protestant property , represented by the signatures to this Petition ; much less shall I venture to declare how particular Protestant individuals , or some Protestant districts still feel on this great question ; but this I may and do assert in the most unqualified manner , that a complete change of sentiment among the Protestants , favourable to the Roman Catholic claims , has happily taken place , particularly since the Union ; nor is it too much to assert , that the Protestants of Ireland are now generally friendly to that measure ; nay , even anxious for its speedy accomplishment . When the infatuated , determined , hostility of the present administration to this question is considered , there can not be a doubt , that had ministers felt there existed generally in Ireland , or in any part of that country , a hostile anti-catholic feeling , they would have done any thing in their power to have drawn forth a declaration of such sentiment : not having made the attempt proves their conviction that any such would have been vain ; that is , it proves that they are well assured , that the Protestant feeling is now friendly , not hostile , to the Catholic cause . Gentlemen seem sorely vexed and displeased , that the member for Derry should have expressed pleasure and satisfaction , when presenting this Petition ; that he should have exulted in the existence of such a document , and have ventured to congratulate his country , that at length every class and sect appeared disposed to make common cause for Irish interest-that all internal feuds were about to cease—that the internal fume of 'divide et im 'pera ' could no longer be played with success , where for centuries a machiave 490 lean short-sighted wicked policy had '' spread desolation and wretchedness . I am compelled to admit that my right hon . friend has indeed rejoiced , nay , even exulted at this happy revolution of sentiment in the Irish Protestant mind—of that crime he has been guilty , and in that of '' fence I wish to be included as having fully participated ; but I positively deny-that he has said one word in condemnation of any part of Ireland , much less any thing calculated to influence one district against the other . True he has stated , that even in the north , in parts of which at one period , a disposition unfriendly to the Catholics , had with great industry been excited , and kept alive ; that even there , no such feeling at present manifested itself : but he has said nothing reflecting upon the north , nothing disrespectful of the Protestants , nothing to irritate , but much to appease and to harmonize in the warm expression of his heartfelt joy at the part the Protestants had taken at such a crisis ; and surely every honest man must be de-lighted at the intelligence—every true Irishman disposed to exult at the bright prospect which this happy revolution of sentiment opens to his country , while every real friend to the peace , power and stability of the empire must anticipate the happiest results from such a union . They who seem disposed , at any risk , to keep alive amongst their countrymen a difference of opinion on any subject , they prove their conduct was questionable at such a moment . It had been argued as if a defiance to collect counter Petitions had been thrown out , but
