most valuable markets which our country ever possessed , would encourage the shipments and importation of grain and flour , now so indispensably necessary to the supply of these islands , would again afford employment to the laborious part of the community , and would , as the petitioners are fully convinced , be found a speedy and substantial remedy for a great part of our present evils , and a security against those much greater calamines which appear to be rapidly approaching , and which the petitioners can not contemplate without sentiments too alarming to be expressed ; and praying , that the House will take this subject into their immediate consideration , and will afford the petitioners such relief as the House may in its wisdom think fit . '' said , that he felt it incumbent upon him to give the most positive contradiction to one paragraph in the Petition which referred immediately to himself , and which was founded on the grossest misrepresentation . It referred to a meeting between him and a committee of gentlemen from Birmingham , at which his right hon . friend ( the Chancellor of the Exchequer ) was present , and the member for the county of Warwick . Instead of using any language which could lead 1063 the gentlemen to think that ministers were insensible to the distresses represented to them , he appealed to all who had been present if the whole of the conversation lid not show that government gave full credit to the statement made ; and he ( Mr. Rose ) expressly allowed , that the iron manufactories of Birmingham were peculiarly injured by the existing obstruction of trade with the United States ; and deeply lamented that nothing could be done for their relief .

He did not understand that the fact was denied that the right hon . gentleman had said that the two countries were in the situation of two men whose heads were in a bucket of water , and the struggle was , which of the two could remain longer in that situation without suffocation . This kind of metaphorical language might sufficiently express the nature of the mercantile contest produced by the Orders in Council , but it was rather unfortunate when addressed to those whose heads were under water , and suffering all the pains of strangulation . .â€”I assert again that I have no recollection of having used such an expression , and I am certain that it was not addressed to any of the gentlemen who waited upon me . I do not undertake to deny it positively ; it might have been said by me . All I can undertake to state positively is , that no such phrase was used by me to the deputation generally ; but whether I said it to any individual I will not pretend to determine . I deny too that if I used it , it proceeded from any want 1064 of feeling on my part for the distresses complained of . said , that a few days afterwards he met some of the gentlemen of the deputation , who
