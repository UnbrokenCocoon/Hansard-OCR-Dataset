, triumphant warfare—prospering commerce , and successful negociation at home , universal satisfaction , tranquillity , confidence , and concord . A New Era , it seems , has opened upon us ; —but what , my lords , let me ask , are those peculiar circumstances from which this high sounding designation has derived 524 its distinguished character ? What is there , in the whole range of foreign or domestic policy , which does not continue to occupy its own former position ? with the exception only of the public conduct , —perhaps the present feelings and opinions ; —I will never permit myself to believe , the principles of the illustrious personage himself . For what act of mercy to a suffering people has introduced , and graced the inauguration , if I may term it so , of this new order of things ? What grievance of the state not unredressed ? What pledge of a long public life not unredeemed ? —Confidence unbounded to those very ministers who , but last year , would not confide to that illustrious person , the unshackled discharge of those royal duties , of which , from the high privilege of his exalted birth , he was the natural and only representative.—The just claims of our Catholic fellow subjects , the conciliation of Ireland , and every former impression on these most interesting and important subjects , complimented away , as a premium and a boon , for the continuance of such an administration as was never permitted at any former time of equal exigency and alarm , to insult the feelings , and betray the dearest interests of a devoted people . Such are the true characteristics of this inauspicious crisis—these the distinguishing features of the new era , unequalled for the easy abandonment of all preconceived opinions and former pledges , by any other , either of ancient or of modern times ; the most prominent and striking circumstances of which , it has been my necessary , though painful duty , thus to expose to your lordships ' view , and which have excited the deepest and most universal spirit of regret , astonishment and indignation . The ministers have drawn as it were a magic circle round the throne , into which none are permitted to enter , on whom the confidence of the illustrious person has been accustomed to repose . Within its range the artificers of mischief have not ceased to work , with too successful industry . What phantoms have they not conjured up to warp the judgment , to excite the feelings , and appal the firmness of the royal mind ? But , though the evil genius should assume a mitred , nay , more than noble form , the sainted aspect which political bigotry delights to wear , or the lineaments of that softer sex , which first beguiled man to his destruction—though , to 525 the allurements of Calypso 's court , were joined the magic , and the charms of that matured enchantress , should the spirit of darkness take the human shape , and issuing forth from the inmost recesses of the gaming house or brothel , presume to place itself near the royal ear ; —what , though the potent spell should not have worked in vain , and that the boasted recantation of all incumbering prepossessions and inconvenient prejudices , had already marked the triumph of its course—though from the royal side they should have torn the chosen friend of his youth , and faithful counsellor of his maturer years , the boast of his own gallant profession , the pride , the hope , the refuge of my distracted country , and a high and conspicuous ornament of yours—though they should have banished from the royal councils talents , integrity , honour and high-minded-ness like his , and should have selected for the illustrious person , an associate and an adviser from Change Alley and from the Stews—though they should have thus filled up , to its full measure , the disgusting catalogue of their enormities , we must still cling to the
