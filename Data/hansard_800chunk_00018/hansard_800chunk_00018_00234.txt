'' presented a Petition from several merchants , manufacturers , and other 426 inhabitants of the town of Birmingham , setting forth , `` That the Petitioners most humbly represent to the House , that the industry and ingenuity of British manufacturers , aided by the spirit of our invaluable constitution , have produced those great mechanical improvements , and called forth that division of labour , which have given to the merchants of this country a pre-eminence in foreign markets , and have greatly contributed to support that naval superiority which has hitherto constituted the strength and security of the nation ; and that not only the revenue , but the very existence of society in its present state in this country , depends upon the prosperity of its manufactures and commerce ; and that they view with the deepest regret the present ruinous situation of the manufactures and commerce of the United Kingdom , and are decidedly of opinion that the Orders in Council , by closing their commercial intercourse with the United States of America , are a principal cause of the
