do not in my own mind anticipate the possibility , ( though I do not by any means at present conceive the probability , ) that circumstances may never be so materially altered as to induce me to review the question in a different light . But I do not myself anticipate that the circumstances will be such as to induce me to view it in a different aspect from what I do at present ; however , I am desirous ( if any new circumstance should arise , tending to alter such a conclusion ) , that the opinion which I am now expressing , will be considered as not involving the opinion of any other individual with whom I am connected in political life ; but that I am only expressing the opinion of myself ; and that upon the question now , at the moment we are discussing it ; at the same time , stating that it is the unanimous opinion of all those with whom I am connected , that the present is not the moment in which any further concessions ought to be made to the Roman Catholics . I beg leave to state this , in some measure in consequence of what we have heard stated in the course of this night , of pledges that have been broken , —of faith that has been violated , —and of hopes that have been excited only to be mocked with disappointment : —because this is the course said to have been taken on this question . Sir , I really felt considerable doubt whether I ought not at the time we heard insinuations of that description thrown out , to have put it to the sense of the House , whether they were allusions and expressions , which could with any degree of propriety be admitted into the debate . This was the course I should have adopted , had I not doubted again , whether I could conclude with certainty , that those insinuations or observations were meant to be connected with any conduct of mine ; or whether they were not united with the speakers themselves . I can not conceive indeed , that because of the conduct pursued by the Irish parliament in 1789 , during the agitation or '' the Regency question , or of the manner in which that conduct was received , any thing like a pledge on the part of any individual in this House , as to the concession of the Catholic Claims , was given or implied , or that the conduct of any individual in this House , either at that time or since that time , can be considered as a pledge . If it was so thought to be intended , I can not conceive any thing more un- 957 founded , in fact , as far as it goes , or more unconstitutional than the opinion that must be involved in that statement . With regard to the idea that any tiling being done , or that could be done by the parliament of Ireland in 1789 , could impose any obligation on any body on their behalf—that is an idea founded upon a gross miscalculation , and utterly inconsistent with that fact : for in 1789 , whatever could be done by the Irish parliament , could not be said to be done by or for the Roman Catholics of Ireland.—For in 1789 , there was no Catholic parliamentary interest , or influence in the Irish parliament : because in the year 1792 , the Petition of the Roman Catholics was rejected by the Commons of Ireland , there being not more than twenty-five members who voted for it . so that in point of fact , nothing could be more inconsistent , supposing at that time and between that and the present , any persons surrounding the illustrious personage to be called to the throne had collected the opinions of that illustrious personage , as to the justice or expediency of granting those Claims , is it to be inferred from hence , that be had involved himself in
