these praiseworthy principles , had always endeavoured to alleviate the distresses of the working men , by expending their capitals in giving them employment , in hopes that the American markets would soon be opened , and the monopoly of the East India Company done away ; so that new sources might be opened to the encouragement of British industry and adventure ; but he was afraid it could not be done much longer ; and it seemed necessary the House should give attention to the subject . The Petition was then read , setting forth , `` That the Petitioners beg leave to represent to the House the distressed situation of the numerous manufacturers of that populous town and neighbourhood ; and that in consequence of the great depression in trade , the labouring mechanics have not sufficient employment to enable them to maintain their families and to preserve them from want ; and the petitioners look up to the House as the representatives and protectors of this great commercial empire , and indulge a confident hope , that the House will adopt such measures as may be best calculated to remedy the distresses and difficulties under which they are at present labouring ; and the petitioners are of opinion , that it is expedient to discontinue the commercial monopoly of the East India Company at the expiration of their present Charter ; and it appears to them to be both unreasonable and 422 unjust , that British subjects should be denied the privilege of trading to India whilst it is allowed to neutral nations ; and praying the House to adopt the necessary measures for the abolition of the commercial monopoly of the East India Company , or at least such part thereof as to their wisdom may seem expedient .

It was his intention not only to submit that business to the consideration of the House , but to carry it through during the present session , unless difficulties should arise of which he had at present no conception . presented a Petition from the master wardens searchers assistants and commonalty of the company of cutlers , within Hallamshire , in the county of York , setting forth , `` That the Petitioners are of opinion that a free trade to every part of his Majesty 's dominions is the natural right of all his subjects ; and that such trade ought to be liable to no restrictions which do not more evidently promote the advantage of the commonwealth , whence , in their very principle , restrictions are only temporary , and ought to be removed as soon as the 423 balance of public interest between a free trade and a monopoly is restored in favour of the former : and that , on the 1st of March , 1814 , the entire right of commerce in the seas and to
