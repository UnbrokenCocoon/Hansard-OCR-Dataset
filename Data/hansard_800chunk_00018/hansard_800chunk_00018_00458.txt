delineation of the manners of Ireland and the policy of England at that day ; and in these are clearly to be traced the true causes of the subsequent rebellion in 1641 , and of many other events in Irish history—the transactions which it records , must be read in order to be conceived . But , whether the fury of the priests against the Lord President , or that of the Lord President against the priests was greatest , is left to the reader to determine . Religion was the point in issue , the work of confiscation had scarcely commenced . This Work has lately been re-published in Dublin . 913 seminaries and colleges to which Ireland has since been indebted for the education of her Roman Cathholic clergy . The genuine spirit of the parent college of Douay , was long the distinguishing characteristic of these seminaries , not merely the enthusiasm of Jesuits for the propagation of their faith , but a bitter recollection of the causes which had driven their founders from their native land , a peculiar , traditional and mortal hostility to the tyrannical and heretical establishment of the Church of England . But even their peculiar hatred to England , fell short of their still more peculiar devotion to the Pope , their great patron and protector ; their attachment to whom was left unchecked by any of those safeguards and precautions which the Roman Catholic powers have found necessary to multiply in the seminaries for the education of their own clergy ; a jealousy which they all have felt , and to the nature of which I shall presently have occasion more particularly to refer , and which has long since reduced the reality of the Pope 's practical authority within very narrow limits ; a jealousy which has perhaps the most distinguished the slates in which at first sight we should the least expect to find it , I mean the states the nearest to the seal of Papal power ; so that , even before the Italian conquests of Buonaparté , if called on to say in what part of Europe the Pope had the least of political authority , we might have answered , amongst his Italian neighbours , while , if called on to point out the spot in which he had the most , we must reply in Ireland , the extreme western limb of his spiritual empire . It was to these seminaries , founded thus equally in hatred of England and devotion to Rome , that Ireland was till lately indebted for the education of her priests . It was in their bosoms they were to learn to become the faithful subjects of the king of England , to imbibe hereditary respect for the British constitution , and hereditary charity for a British Protestant ; and after having been thus indebted to the bounty of foreigners and enemies for this salutary education , after having passed in a foreign land the season of life peculiarly formed for the reception of impressions , full of foreign ideas , prejudices , and attachments , and after having had their eyes accustomed to all the pride , and pomp , and glorious circumstance with which their religion is performed on the continent , they were to set out on what they 914 emphatically termed their Irish Mission , that is , to see their religion in its native land , not merely shorn of its honours , but , I will say , in times past the peculiar object of `` the oppressor 's wrong and proud man 's contumely , '' and ( if they could escape transportation for the crime of landing ) to teach their flocks , groaning under penal laws , the virtue of resignation . Sir ; if that was indeed the lesson which they did teach , they must previously have subdued in their own breasts every passion , interest , prejudice , and feeling of human nature ; —if that was indeed the lesson which they taught , be theirs the merit of it—for Philip and the parliaments of Ireland
