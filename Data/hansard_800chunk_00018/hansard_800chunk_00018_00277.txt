gracious and immediate interposition of the common father of all his people . For in what other character could the sovereign power exhibit itself , with such appropriate grace and dignity ? And so deeply is that feeling impressed upon my mind , that I should accept , with some mixture , almost of regret , as the mere triumph of the political struggle of contending parties , the important object for which I am now contending for my Catholic countrymen ; if the unhappy circumstances of the present moment , did not lead me now nearly to despair of its accomplishment at any time , as the measure of unenforced liberality . But , why was not this question already put at rest , and the good work of conciliating Ireland at least begun , by the gracious reccommendation from the throne , of the Catholic Claims , as an early act of the Regent 's unlimited government ? For the last twelve years , the accomplishment of that healing measure had been rendered , perhaps , impossible , by those conscientious scruples , which were known to have existed in the mind of a certain illustrious individual ; though the moment , at which the existence of such an obstacle was announced to the public for the first time , was assuredly not the most appropriate and satisfactory ; under all the circumstances of the case . It was not , till after the ministers in both countries , and amongst the rest a noble viscount , who sits in the other House , had given to the Catholics the strongest grounds of being assured , at least of the early and favourable consideration of their claims , in the imperial legislature , and that they had accomplished the measure of union by such effectual aid , that they discovered , or at least communicated to those whose services they no longer needed , that they could not perform their part of this so strongly implied contract . It is , however , matter of public notoriety , that such an obstruction has now entirely ceased to exist . To whatever I or any other person may conceive to be the actual opinions of the Prince Regent , at the present moment , on this or on any other public question , I know it would not be parliamentary for me to allude in this place , But , if I may be permitted to argue , from what the opinions of the same illustrious person were known to have been , as prince 514 of Wales , and before he had assumed the exercise of the executive functionsâ€” called the noble lord to order . He thought it highly disorderly to allude to the opinions of any person exercising the royal functions of the realm , or to conjecture what they were ; as it was quite unparliamentary , to attempt to influence the deliberations of that House , by stating the opinions of the Prince Regent . If the noble lord 's patience in hearing me had not been overcome , by his excessive zeal to preserve order , he might have learned , by this time , that I had no intention of saying what he has supposed me to have said . Had the noble lord heard me out , he would have found , that I was speaking merely to a point of history , to what history records , to have been , at a certain period , the political sentiments of the then Prince of Wales ; to that , as such , I contend I have a right to speak ; and I must beg leave of the noble lord to add , that such unseasonable interruptions are not the best means to preserve order , and that all similar attempts to obstruct my humble efforts in this good cause , shall prove as impotent as the present . My Catholic countrymen have not placed their interests in such hands , as will permit them to be thwarted and put down , by interruptions so unseasonable , improper , and
