. One hon . gentleman has referred much to history , from which in my opinion , he would have done more wisely to have abstained , because that reciprocation of injuries which for centuries formed almost the only connection between England and Ireland was an invidious topic , more calculated to irritate than to allay animosity , —nor would I my-self have touched on it , only with a view to rebut the false inferences which have been drawn from a partial view of the subject . In our Union with Scotland we treated with her as an equal ; finding the people in possession of an established form of worship and attached to it , we enquired not into its truth or its conformity to our own ; but , satisfied that it was the religion of the majority , we solemnly confirmed it in possession . Ireland on the other hand , after long and bitter contentions , we had by force subdued ; and her treatment was that of a conquered province . The vast majority of her population we found Catholics ; and contrary to all right and justice—contrary to all sound policy , since England had become Protestant , we not only subverted the establishment of the Irish majority , but erected our own on its ruins , using it and its revenues , not for the only legitimate purpose of any establishment , the promotion of morality and virtue , the instruction of the people , and the support of religious worship , according to that form which best satisfies the majority , on which ground alone a whole nation can justly be called on to contribute ; but compelling all to pay for the convenience of a few , applying the contributions to the maintenance of an hierarchy repugnant to the feelings of the country , and whose chief use is , that of a political engine to uphold and strengthen the civil power of the conquerors . Is this the way to appease discontents—to eradicate old prejudices—to reconcile differences—to extirpate foreign attachments ? The Church of England worship indeed has now been so long established there , and is so interwoven with the rights of property and the 951 frame of the government , that its subversion , in favour of any other , can not now for a moment be contemplated : but surely the liberal , the just , the obvious policy would be to attach the Catholic clergy , and through them their people , to the Protestant government , by taking them openly and directly under its protection , and applying part of the Church revenues to their decent and comfortable maintenance . Thus would the laity feel that a portion at least of those revenues was equitably directed , and the clergy having at home a natural object of their respect and affection , would speedily lose those regards towards any foreign head which could reasonably excite apprehension or Jealousy in their civil superiors . On these principles we acted in Canada , not then surmising that even Frenchmen might not be indulged in a partial establishment of their religion , without endangering their allegiance ; but conceiving on the other hand , that to free them from all irksome and unnecessary restraints was the best mode to secure it ; and when have we heard of any disturbances occasioned by the Pope in Canada ? Why then should we not extend measures equally kind and paternal to Ireland , or why fear that there only , generosity and justice would fail to produce their uniform effects on the human heart ? There are many other points on which I could with pleasure have enlarged , but the subject has been so amply and ably discussed on the present as well as on former occasions , by the highest talents in this assembly , that I will occupy no more of your lime , but conclude by expressing my firm conviction , that the question is now no longer , whether the thing should be done , but when ? Whether you should immediately secure the
