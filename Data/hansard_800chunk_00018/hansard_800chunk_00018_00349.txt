of Scotland , where it must tend to do away the Test Acts , established by the laws of that country , and settled by compact at the Union ; and however easy it may seem to the noble lord to dispense with the laws of England and Ireland , upon this subject , I believe he will not find it so easy to deal with the test of the law of Scotland . I can not consent to the measure of going into a committee , for the purpose of doing away laws which we deem necessary for the safety of the Established Church , until it can be clearly shewn to me , that there is a necessity for going into a question which is directly to affect that security , and to excite disquiet amongst all classes of his Majesty 's Protestant subjects in both kingdoms . But , I say , ray lords , if you should be of opinion , that it is right to give up what the Catholics claim ; and that such a surrender is indispensible , as it is alleged , to procure their tranquillity and your safety , you should give it at once , without the delay of a committee , and bring in a Bill for the purpose . My lords , agreeing as I do with the noble lord in respect of the principles which preceded the Revolution in this country , he will allow me to say , that the result of that event was not only to provide for the security of our civil , but our religious liberty ! and that king William was called to the throne of these realms to protect our Protestant religion , as well as our civil liberty . Have noble lords read the Bill of Rights ? I have read it over and over again ; and I say , it not only complains of the civil tyranny to which it alludes , and against the recurrence of which it expressly purposes to protect us for ever ; but it also complains of the religious tyranny , with which that civil tyranny was so intimately connected . Upon what ground , then , was it that this Bill of Rights was founded , unless upon the establishment of a government purely Protestant in Church and State ? My lords , have I forgotten all that I have been reading upon this subject ; or have I misunderstood the doctrines expressly laid down by the great authorities , who lived nearest the Revolution , and who were leading actors in all the great transactions which took place at that period ? Look at the language of Somers and Hardwicke on that subject ; for , if I err , I have been misled by the writings of those great characters ; and , my lords , to the doctrines 691 and opinions laid down by those men , as to the principles on which your constitution was founded ; notwithstanding all that your lordships have heard upon this and former occasions , in direct deviation from those principles , you ought to cling to them with the most scrupulous caution , as principles upon which depend , and to which we must look for the security of our property , and our protection from the recurrences of all tyranny , civil or religious . My lord Hardwicke has said , that Protestantism was the very key-stone of your constitution ; and you are now called upon to wrest that key-stone from this memorable fabric ; and expose it to the dangers of falling to ruin . My lords , I have been told , that it is less dangerous now to yield to the claims of the Roman Catholics in Ireland , than it would have been , while there was an independent parliament in that part of the empire , however perilous the measure might have been then , it was not so after the Union ; because , when the Catholics came to vote in an English parliament , there would be no danger from their numbers
