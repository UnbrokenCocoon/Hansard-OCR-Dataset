it be for me , from their recent debates and publications to produce such testimonies as might lead a thinking man to form more than a doubt upon the subject : easy indeed would it be for me to cite arguments upon arguments , openly relied on by their warmest advocates , to prove that all will be incomplete without that very Repeal of the Union , which I have alluded to : a consequence of the concession which I have observed to startle some gentlemen whom I address . Nay , Sir , I could cite their authorities , not few in number , declaring , under various modifications of expression , that connection with this country has been the bane of Ireland ; and in which a termination of that cause of evil is not obscurely recommended . But I have trespassed too long already on your patience , to render such details admissible : I am also aware of the injustice of attributing to a party , the imprudeuces of a few . Justice , on the other hand , compels me to observe , that it does not appear from any reports of the proceedings which I allude to , that such expressions were received with any disapprobation by the audiences to which they were addressed . But I would ask the right hon . gentleman who has proposed this question , whether , in the very circumstance of their retractation of the once proffered Veto , we are not justified in apprehending that a distinctness of political feeling is at the bottom ? The objections to the concesssion must be either religious or political ; they can not be religious , for their bishops , during nine years together , had under their hands consented to agree to it ; and that can not have become religiously wrong 930 now , which was religiously right , when they so consented ; and if it is political , what , I would ask , is that political cause of it , that is not in itself a distinctness of object on their part ? The right honourable gentleman who introduced this question , says , indeed , that all who take my view of this question , are bound to vote for the enquiry . I must beg his pardon : an honourable gentleman who spoke for the first time in this debate , has refused to go into the committee , because he does not know the terms on which the Catholics are prepared to treat ; Sir , I refuse it for a reason the opposite to his ; —I refuse it because I do know their terms ; they are not unavowed , and they are these—that they will have all from us , and that we shall have nought from them . This is the short and the simple basis of the proposed negociation . And am I , who have ventured to condemn the proceedings of the Irish parliament , on the express grounds that having much to require as well as much to concede , they gave up most of what they had and obtained nothing in return , —am I to be told , that I am bound , on the same terms , to add all the remainder to all that they have thrown away ? Sir , for the reasons which I have offered , —reasons political and not religious , reasons defensive and not intolerant , —I vote against going into any enquiry at present on the subject : —and here I might sit down , thanking the House for their extreme indulgence ; but , as the opposers of the Catholic claims are now divided into those who oppose concession without terms , and concession in toto , beg leave to add a word upon that point , with the same freedom that I have spoken upon others.—The Veto I consider as an idle bauble , not worth acceptance on the one side , or refusal on the other : but if the day should ever come , when their clergy , instead of trusting
