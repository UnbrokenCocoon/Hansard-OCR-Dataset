heretics , that it is no article of their faith ; and they renounce , reject , and abjure the opinion , that princes , excommunicated by the Pope and council , or by any authority whatsoever , may be deposed or murdered by their subjects or by any person whatsoever ; that they do not believe that the Pope of Rome , or any other foreign prince , prelate , state , or potentate , hath , or ought to have , any temporal or civil jurisdiction , power , superiority , or pre-eminence , within this realm ; that they firmly believe , that no act , in itself unjust , immoral , or wicked , can ever be justified or excused by or under pretence or colour that it was done for the good of the Church , or in obedience to any ecclesiastical power whatsoever ; and that it is not an Article of the Catholic Faith , neither are they thereby required to believe or profess , that the Pope is infallible , or that they are bound to any order , in its own nature immoral , though the Pope or any ecclesiastical power should issue or direct such order , but that , on the contrary , they hold that it would be sinful in them to pay any respect or obedience thereto ; and that they do not believe that any sin whatsoever , committed by them , can be forgiven at the mere will of any Pope , or of any Priest , or of any person or persons whatsoever , but that any person who receives absolution , without a sincere sorrow for such sin , and a firm and sincere resolution to avoid future guilt , and to atone to God , so far from obtaining thereby any remission of his sin , incurs the additional guilt of violating a sacrament ; and , by the same solemn obligations , they are bound and firmly pledged to defend , to the utmost of their power , the settlement and arrangement of property in Ireland , as established by the laws now in being ; that they have declared , disavowed , and solemnly abjured , any intention to 404 subvert the present Church establishment , for the purpose of substituting a Catholic establishment in its stead ; and that they have solemnly sworn , that they will not exercise any privilege , to which they are or may become entitled , to disturb and weaken the Protestant religion or Protestant government in Ireland ; and that they can , with perfect truth , assure the House , that the political and moral principles asserted by these solemn and special tests are not merely in unison with their fixed principles , but expressly inculcated by the religion which they profess ; and they do most humbly trust , that , as professors of doctrines which permit such tests to be taken , they shall appear to the House to be entitled to the full enjoyment of religious freedom , under the happy constitution of these realms ; and that frequently has the legislature of Ireland borne testimony to the uniform peaceable demeanour of the Irish Roman Catholics , to their acknowledged merits as good and loyal subjects , to the wisdom and sound policy of admitting them to all the blessings of a free constitution , and of thus binding together all classes of people by mutual interest and mutual affection ; and that yet may they humbly represent to the House , and they do so at this perilous crisis , with sincere regret and deep solicitude , that the Roman Catholics of Ireland still remain subject to severe and humiliating laws , rigidly enforced , universally felt , and inflicting upon them divers injurious and vexatious disabilities incapacities privations and penalties , by reason of their conscientious adherence to the religious doctrines of their forefathers ; and that , for nearly the entire period of the last twenty years , the progress of religious freedom has been obstructed , and , whilst other Christian nations have hastened to
