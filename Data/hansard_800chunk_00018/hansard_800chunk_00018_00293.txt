that can revive the memory of former conflicts ; but I believe it has been , unfortunately , too much the policy of those who have governed Ireland , to keep up distinctions in the country , and divide one party against the other . To eradicate the old and long cherished distinctions between Irishman and Englishman , must be a work of time and conciliation . Had those distinctions 606 been done away with at the time of the Revolution , we should not at this day have to regret the misfortunes which have since occurred in that country , and the disaffections in the minds of the lower Irish towards this , which are still un '' abated ; and though I am convinced , my lords , that the concessions proposed will form one great step towards a consequence so desirable , and though I am equally persuaded that time and measures of lenity and conciliation will ultimately crown the work , yet I am not sanguine enough to expect such immediate and effectual advantages from this measure as the noble earl so confidently predicts . —My lords ; before I proceed to address your lordships on the general principles of the great question before us , I can not refrain from expressing my astonishment at some part of the speech of the noble and learned lord who spoke last but one ; and particularly at that part in which he has alluded to a test which , he says , has been imposed in an Irish county , I think Galway , in which the Catholic electors have entered into Resolutions never to vote for any parliamentary candidate who should not pledge himself not only to support Catholic Emancipation , but also not to accept or solicit for himself or any other person , any office , power , or emolument , under the present , administration , or any other , until that question be conceded . It seems , indeed , rather ludicrous , that in the noble lord 's zeal to prevent the consideration of this question , he should have put a topic of this sort as it were in the very front of his argument ; just as if the county of Galway possessed a political influence so formidable over the rest of Ireland , that it was necessary to relieve his Majesty 's ministers from its pressure , by putting an end at once to this great topic . As I entertain no such apprehensions , as those of the noble and learned lord , from the circumstance he has stated , I can not agree with him , in the necessity of dismissing the great question of this night . My lords ; the question before your lordships at this moment is , whether , under all the circumstances of the times , and of the country , and with all ' the Petitions that now load your table , all the representations and solicitations which have been made to you year after year , all the agitations which this subject has created , and still continues to create in Ireland , 607 and all the intreaties of the great majority of the wealth and population in that country , Catholic and Protestant , now pressing on you in favour of this measure ; —with opinions , I believe , in most parts of this country , favourable to the question ; at least with no manifest resistance or objection to it ; whether , I say , with all these considerations before you , your lordships have made up your minds to negative the proposition this night submitted to you by the noble lord who opened this debate . I wish , my lords , to put the question briefly , and I ask you this , `` Whether there is any of you who think that this concession ought not to be made , or that without it , the Protestant establishment would not be endangered ; and whether the measure of itself , would not be a formidable bulwark to the Protestant establishment ? I ask
