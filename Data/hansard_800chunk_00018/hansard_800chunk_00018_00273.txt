high office I have the honour of filling in the University , from which I have but a few hours since received this Petition , ( an office I feel the greatest pride in possessing ) yet I do not mean to pledge myself to any opinion either for or against the important question , upon which your lordships are this night going to deliberate . Nothing would have induced me to come down on the present occasion , but for the very high respect I entertain for that Very learned body whose Petition I hold in my hand ; and I propose leaving the House as soon as I have heard it read . said ; My lords , from the relation I have the honour to bear to the University of Cambridge , it is impossible that I should not feel some anxiety to trouble your lordships with a few words in consequence of the Petition which has been just read . None can be more ready than I am to admit the weight that is due to every thing that proceeds from that learned body ; at the same time , my lords , with all the respect that I bear to the University collectively , and with all the respect and regard that I feel for many of the individuals , who probably are parties to this Petition , I trust I may be permitted to remark , that the weight which is given to any act , from whatever quarter it proceeds , must necessarily bear some proportion to the degree of deliberation and discussion which it has undergone . Now , my lords , I am sorry to be under the necessity of observing that this Petition , though relating to a question of great importance to the state , is not the result of that consideration to which the subject is certainly intitled . On the contrary , it is a fact which can not be denied , that the intention of proposing any Petition at all , was not known in the University on the evening before the day ( viz . yesterday ) on which it was proposed in the senate ; and if a right reverend prelate were now in his place , he would confirm what I now state to your lordships , that though presiding over the largest college in the University , he was not apprised till the evening of the day before yesterday , that any such measure was in contemplation . And , yet , my lords , with all this secrecy , the majority in favour of the Petition was very , inconsiderable . In the Black-hood House , which consists of masters of arts , above five years standing , the members were , for the Petition 24 , against it 19 ; and in the White-hood House , for a Petition 34 , against it 20 . It must here be observed , that the circumstances of the doctors having the privilege of voting in the White-hood House , if they think proper to do so , accounts for the majority being greater than in the Black-hood House . Under these circumstances , my lords , I certainly can not consider this Petition as conveying the sense of the University at large ; but at all events , it will receive its due weight from your lord-ships ; and I am bound to say , that many of the individuals from whom it proceeds , 508 are of the most respectable description for their abilities and learning , and would not have brought before your lordships any Petition that was not expressive of their genuine and sincere opinions upon this or any other subject . I am , there fore , sincerely concerned to find myself obliged to differ from them so entirely upon this occasion ; but I can not , in deference to any individuals , or any body , however respectable , abandon opinions ' which are the result of much consideration and long experience ; opinions so far as relates to the penal laws , entertained from a
