The noble lord , in what had dropped from him on the subject , had by no means explained what he had asserted as to foreign troops . He did not conceive himself bound to adduce any instance of foreign officers commanding British troops ; but this he would say , that if a single foreigner had been placed in such a situation , those who appointed him had acted illegally . presented a Petition from the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood of Bolton-in-the-Moors , assembled pursuant to public advertisement , setting forth , `` That many of the Petitioners are , in consequence of the depressed state of trade , in a situation of extreme distress , 30 and that the distress approaches so nearly to actual starvation , that they think it would be highly imprudent any longer to delay communicating their situation to the House : and that immense numbers of the industrious manufacturers in their neighbourhood , are reduced to the necessity of working for less than one fourth of what they would previous to the commencement of the war with France , whilst the necessaries of life are , since that period , nearly doubled in price ; and that they are convinced , by sad and dear-bought experience , that the expensive war in which this country has been so long engaged , is the immediate cause of the distresses they now labour under ; and that the continuance of this war , and most of its concomitant evils , are attributable to the imperfect representation of the people in the House ; and it is the humble opinion of the Petitioners , that if the House consisted of representatives of the people only , it would not , for any doubtful prospect of benefit to our allies , consent to expose the people of this country to the certain misery , ruin and starvation , which the continuance of the war must bring upon them ; and that , though the Petitioners have , on many occasions , been proud to express their loyalty and patriotism , and their willingness to sacrifice their lives , if necessary , in defence of their invaluable constitution ; yet they can not help shrinking from the horrible form in which death now seems to await them and their helpless families , unalleviated by any circumstances of glory or of advantage to their beloved country ; and praying , that the House will take into its serious consideration the privations and sufferings of his Majesty 's loyal subjects in their populous district , and will devise some speedy means of relieving them ; and further , that the House will , by all the means in its power , endeavour to bring about the so much wished for Reform in the Representation of the people : and will also recommend to his royal highness the Prince Regent , that no means be left untried which are likely to restore to his Majesty 's loyal and long-suffering people the blessings of peace .
