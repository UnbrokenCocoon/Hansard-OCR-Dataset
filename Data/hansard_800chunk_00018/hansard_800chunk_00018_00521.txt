that he had himself received letters corroborating the facts formerly brought before the House . The Petition was then brought up and read ; setting forth , `` That the petitioners are compelled , by the most urgent necessity , to lay their distresses and their grievances before the House ; and that the general depression of the commerce and manufactures of the country has been particularly felt by the town and port of Liverpool ; that the trade has rapidly declined ; and that the more laborious part of the inhabitants , consisting of shipwrights , ropemakers , sail-makers , carpenters , porters , carters , and labourers , with their numerous families , are reduced to a state of unexampled suffering and distress ; and that the petitioners have heard , with surprize and indignation , that statements have been made tending to keep the House , and the country at large , in ignorance of the real state of that populous town , and denying facts which are but too grievously notorious to every inhabitant of the place ; and that it is not true , as the petitioners understand it has been publicly represented , that there were not more than from 3,000 to 4,000 persons whose necessities entitled them to support and assistance from a public subscription of the inhabitants , entered into for that purpose ; and that it is not true that not a single shipwright is out of employ in Liverpool , who is willing to work ; and that the fact is , that the distresses of the labouring part of the community and their families having rendered relief indis- 1060 pensably necessary , a public subscription was entered into for that object in the month of December last , by which nearly 16,000 persons were in one week relieved and that the petitioners compute the number of persons so receiving relief to have been at least one-sixth part of the present population of the town ; and that the falshood of the assertion , that there is no want of employ for those who are willing to work , is apparent through the whole town of Liverpool , amidst all its docks , on all its quays , and in every street , where numbers of industrious mechanics , many of whom are free burgesses of the town , are seen without employment , whilst others are compelled by their necessities to solicit in the vicinity of the town for charitable aid ; and that , in addition to the want of employ , the distressed situation of the town is aggravated by the present high and rapidly increasing price of all the necessaries of life , from which evils , if some relief can not be obtained , by the speedy interference of the House , the petitioners can not but apprehend the most alarming and fatal consequences ; and that it appears to the petitioners to be as impious as it is unjust , to attribute the distresses which affect the country principally to the dispensations of Providence , as to the productions of the soil , or to any other cause which the interference of the House , in conjunction with the other branches of the legislature , may not in a great degree remove ; and that the petitioners have heard , with real alarm , that a high and confidential servant of the crow did , in the presence of his Majesty 's Chancellor of the Exchequer , and of a respectable deputation from the inhabitants of a large manufacturing town , lately make use of language which appears to the petitioners , from the time and occasion on which it was introduced , to develope the views and intentions of ministers more decisively than thousands of state papers and public documents ; and shews that they are prepared to risk the very existence of the country on the further prosecution of measures which have already reduced it to its present unexampled state of suffering ; and that the petitioners can not but avow to the House , their most solemn conviction that the distresses
