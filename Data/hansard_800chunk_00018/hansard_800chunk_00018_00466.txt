upon this subject , think that this parliament was not much to blame for re-possessing themselves , however roughly , of the estates of their ancestors.—But , waving all argument on that point , I will only observe , that the next act of this parliament was one which can not plead even that justification ; for this act of repeal operated as the seizure only of two-thirds of Ireland , but in the remaining third the Protestants 925 possessed a great quantity of real property , acquired long prior to that period—acquired not by forfeiture , but by purchase and intermarriage ; and this became the object of a second Act , to which I shall beg now to advert . This second Act , Sir , enumerates a long list of names of Protestant nobility and gentry , declaring that every one of them are `` thereby declared and adjudged traitors , convicted and attainted of high-treason , and shall suffer such pains of death , and penalties of forfeiture , as in cases of high treason are accustomed . '' To enable the House to judge of the general nature of this list , it may be sufficient to observe , that it contained the names of sixty-two lay and nine spiritual peers , above thirty baronets , above eighty clergymen , very nearly two thousand two hundred esquire , And many others—in all , nearly two thousand five hundred persons . In other acts of attainder which have been levelled against individuals of convicted guilt , and on mature examination of proofs , the rights of remainder-men and reversioners have naturally been attended to ; but this Act of Attainder was distinguished by confiscating the fee and inheritance , where an estate for life was all the property which the persons condemned had in the lands . And the evidence of the guilt was not unworthy of the rest of the proceeding . The Catholic Speaker , in presenting the Act for the royal assent , informed king James , in the presence of such members of the House of Peers as had escaped becoming the objects of its enactments , that these persons had been found guilty ( I use the words of Mr. Speaker , ) `` some upon evidence which had satisfied the House of Commons , the rest on common fame . '' A shew of mercy was indeed reserved . These persons are attainted only on condition that they do not come in by the November then following , and take their trials by such juries as were in readiness to receive them : but even this shew of mercy afforded only a new occasion of injustice , for it is a certain fact that lord Gosworth , the Catholic chancellor of the day , kept this Act in his own possession unprinted and unpublished until four months after that November had elapsed ; and during that whole period all that was known was , that there were about 2,500 persons attainted , but who they were , no interest could discover . Nor let it be imagined that in the violent 926 character of James , we may discover the cause and the apology for these severities . It was not more the true interest than the real wish of James to have avoided coming to such extremities with the Irish Protestants , which he well knew must destroy every hope that remained for him in England ; he had even desired his judges to assure the people from the bench , that he would preserve inviolate this very Act of Settlement shortly previous to his being obliged to give his royal assent for its repeal : but in truth that unhappy prince was as little responsible for the deeds of that parliament , as their noble leader is for any proceedings of the present Catholic committee . Such , Sir , are two out of many of the acts of this parliament ; and to what they might afterwards have proceeded it is not easy to imagine , had not their career been interrupted by the battle of the
