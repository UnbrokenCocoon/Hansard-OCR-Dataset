down , I feel myself called upon , if on no other account but that of the very numerous and respectable body , with whom I am most intimately connected , ( university of Oxford ) not to suffer this question to pass with my silent vote . I feel that I should not do my duty by them , if I did not rise , and , on their parts , disclaim that conclusion which has been formed of the motives which induced them to present that Petition to your lordships on this occasion , which now lies on your table ; and which I do say , is the result of fair and full deliberation ; and not actuated by any motives of illiberality , of bigotry , or intolerance , towards his Majesty 's Roman Catholic subjects ; but founded on that well-grounded and loyal attachment , ever evinced by that learned body towards the constitution of this country ; with a just reference to the principles upon which that constitution was settled at the time of the Revolution . My lords , I disclaim , on my own part too , that I have ever voted on this subject upon any principle of intolerance . I never did , nor ever will give any vote 689 against the extending the religious , or civil liberties , of any class of his Majesty 's subjects , when I think I can give that vote for such extension consistently with the security of our own establishments ; but I shall always be guided in my decisions on such subjects , by what I conceive necessary to maintain the constitution , as by law established ; for the happiness and security of the great whole . This , my lords , was the principle which has uniformly governed my conduct , and which shall do so on this subject .

Will your lordships give me leave to call your attention to what the motion is now before you ? It is , that you will go into a committee to enquire what are the laws which now operate to prevent the Roman Catholics of Ireland from being admitted into all the advantage 's of place and power in the state , equally with the members of the Protestant Church , in order to devise the means of abrogating those laws ; and , my lords , through the whole tenor of this debate it has been warmly asserted , that the Protestants , as well as Catholics of Ireland , are equally desirous of this change . But , my lords , if you have any regard to the Protestant Church of Ireland , which docs not now exist as a separate establishment ; but is united for ever by the Union with the Protestant Church of England , I would ask , how you can go into such a question , and with such views , without affecting the Protestant establishment in both countries ; And I will be glad also to know how you can exclude from such a consideration his Majesty 's Roman Catholic subjects in Scotland ? Their number , it is true , may be fewer than those in Ireland ; but the principle of justice is the same ; and the question , therefore , must be one , which not only affects the Established Church of England and Ireland , 690 but also that
