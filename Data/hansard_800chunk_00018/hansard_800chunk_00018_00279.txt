in that very discussion , into which we complain that we have not been permitted to enter ? But the noble lord must have been perfectly aware , that it was impossible to give to any measure a due parliamentary consideration , excepting in a committee only . For what arguments can it require , to convince any reasoning mind that no great measure can be discussed with a view to any practicable result , except in a committee . And above all others , the case of his Majesty 's Catholic subjects ; split , as it is , into so many subdivisions , by the various heads of proscription , to which they are still exposed ; and branching out , as it does , into so many complicated relations , of individual interests and public security . To refuse to a subject , so extensively complicated in its several relations , so deeply interesting to the public weal in its important results , a grave discussion in a Committee of the whole House , is to say , in effect , that you will not discuss the subject at all for any practical result ; it is to shut your ears against the Catholic grievances altogether and for ever ; it is to turn from the bar of this House unheard , four-fifths of the population of the sister country , who claim at your lordships ' hands the restitution of their own constitutional rights ; and the other Protestant million of the constituency of the same state , who demand a free and complete admission , for their Catholic fellow subjects , into the constitution of their country . Having at all times , whenever it has fallen to my lot to address your lordships upon this subject , put the question on the strong ground of constitutional right , I will hot now degrade its magnitude and importance , by condescending to enter into a detailed consideration of the particular impolicy and mischief of each existing disability ; nor now be driven to argue every separate head of exclusion as a distinct grievance in itself , on its own peculiar constitutional demerits . It is the principle of exclusion against which I raise my voice—that principle which would draw a line of perpetual demarcation between the citizens of the same common-wealth , the subjects of the same King—which would brand upon the foreheads of our Catholic countrymen 517 the foul imputation of unassured fidelity to the parent state—would claim for the Protestant part of the community the British constitution as their exclusive inheritance—and cut up by the roots every prospect of uniting those conflicting interests , by that complete and useful adjustment , which can be expected to stand on no foundation less assured than this ; the enjoyment of the same constitutional privileges ; the acknowledgment of the same constitutional rights . Placing my argument on such high ground , I will not fritter its consequence away by endeavouring to shew , by a regular train of proofs , why the same man , to whom , as colonel , the command of a regiment is now confided , may not be safely trusted , as a general officer , with the command of a brigade ; why those , who are already spread over the face of the whole country , as justices of the peace , and who , at the quarter sessions , in every one of the thirty-two counties , administer the functions of civil and criminal jurisdiction , so extensively , may not preside in the superior courts , as judges of the land ; and why those who are already admitted into the elective franchise , should not themselves be eligible to the trust of representing others ? On the act of 1793 I take my stand , containing , as it does , a long catalogue of grievous disabilities : I produce it to your lordships as sufficient evidence , to prove the case of my Catholic countrymen , in the existence of those exclusions from constitutional privileges ; the removal of which is the ground of
