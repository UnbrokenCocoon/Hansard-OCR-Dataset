the territories between the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of Magellan , granted to the East India Company , will expire , when the free trade in those seas and to those territories will of course revert to all his Majesty 's subjects , to whom it belongs , and from whom it ought not to be withheld , unless the paramount interest of the state itself requires a continuance of the afore-mentioned monopoly ; and that , since the incorporation of the East India Company , the British dominions in that quarter of the globe have been so greatly enlarged , that it is impossible for the Company , in its present circumstances , to carry on a traffic throughout the East , commensurate to the extent of territory under the government or the controul of his Majesty , whence their monopoly is not even beneficial to themselves in proportion as it is detrimental to the general interests of British commerce ; and that it is well known that the prosperity of the East India Company has not increased with the glorious progress of his Majesty 's arms , which have left the enemies of Britain without a colony ; and that the annual exports of our home manufactures to all the regions of the East , scarcely amount to one fifth of the ordinary exports to the United States of America , though the former countries exceed the latter sevenfold in extent , and fifty-fold in population ; hence the Petitioners presume that , after the expiration of their charter , the Company still remaining a corporation , may fully , if not more profitably , employ their funds in the trade as heretofore , while the mother country will be benefited beyond what it has been or can be under the monopoly , to the extent of the additional commerce opened by the industry spirit and capital of enterprizing individuals ; and that the intercourse with the East Indies , prohibited to the subjects of these realms , having been conceded to foreign powers in amity with his Majesty , the merchants of the United States of America have been enriching themselves commercially and politically , exalting their own nation , and supplying many parts of the world with East India produce , to the loss of this country : and that the Petitioners will not dwell here on the difficulties under which , as merchants and manufacturers , the numerous inhabitants 424 of their district labour in the present circumstances of the country , but they look , with confidence , to their representatives in parliament for relief , under temporary calamities , by an unreserved grant of every facility to commerce which the interest of the whole state demands , and which the most liberal policy will justify ; and they do most earnestly and respectfully intreat the House , not to deprive the whole body of British merchants of any part of their rightful inheritance , a free trade to every part of his Majesty 's dominions , by renewing the charter of the East India Company ; and they rely on the wisdom and virtue of parliament thus to turn to the utmost advantage the immense possessions of our sovereign in the East , to counterbalance , in some measure , the iniquitous and tyrannical prohibitions of our enemy on the continent of Europe , to compensate for the interruption of friendly intercourse , whether temporary or permanent , with the united States of America , and , above all , to render this country so far independent of commerce with rival nations , that , whether at war or at peace , we may have strength and resources within ourselves to conduct the former with glory and success , and to enjoy the latter with honour and security .
