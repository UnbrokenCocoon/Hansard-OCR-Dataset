even that would be inefficient , without other auxiliary restrictions . And lastly , the House was addressed by many honourable members , who not feeling assured that any of the plans proposed would answer the purpose , and having none to propose themselves , still voted for the committee , under confident hopes that some new lights would be struck out in the committee , though the committee , now proposed , and for which they stated their intention to vote , did not afford any reasonable expectation of realizing those hopes . Now , I am certain the House will go along with me in considering these securities , restrictions , and safeguards , as substantial ingredients in the measure proposed . It would be a monstrous deception to consider them as mere matter of detail in the framing and embodying the measure ; they form a main part of its essence , and therefore to say , that the House , being only called upon to recognize the principle , it is not necessary to explain in detail the securities , is , in my judgment , a perfect fallacy . The principal point of restriction , alluded to in the debate , has been with reference to foreign influence , and the discussion , on that single point , affords sufficient grounds to call for a resistance to the motion . It has been asserted , that the Veto is not worth contending for ; that Domestic Nomination will do as well . I admit the Veto is not worth contending for : but at the same time , think it important to remark , that the Veto has been rejected , not because it was obnoxious to the feelings of the Roman Catholics , but because they considered that it was inconsistent with the tenets of their religion , in the light in which they viewed the proposition at the time it was made , to admit of such a restriction on the spiritual supremacy of their church ; and how , therefore , can any hope or expectation be entertained that Domestic Nomination , which involves the same question , of the spiritual supremacy , the only other avowed expedient , can possibly be acquiesced in : and here is the im- 1031 portance of the present tone and temper of the Roman Catholics , and also of the present captivity of the Pope ; because it is most essential , in order to ascertain what restriction on this foreign influence can be chalked out , both efficient for the security of the Protestant establishments , and admissible by the Roman Catholics , that a communication should be had with the head of their church , with that authority , which would now be acknowledged as full , free , and undoubted , and which would , at all times hereafter , be considered as indisputable and unimpeachable : and I will ask , can such a communication be now considered as practicable ? Nobody has ventured to affirm it , and few , I am persuaded , will think that , without such a communication , these claims can be conceded . Having thus stated myself dissatisfied with the heads of the plans that have been suggested ; having it admitted to me , by a great majority of the House , that safeguards are necessary ; having none to propose myself , I can not agree with those members , who , being much in the same state of darkness with myself , both as to the propriety of what has been proposed , and the practicability of putting it into execution , are nevertheless inclined , at once , to vole for this committee , and trust to future discussions for the essential details of this measure . No man , in my opinion , is justified in taking this step , without an entire conviction that the measure can now be perfected ; hopes and expectations that it may be matured are not sufficient , for I am certain that , if the House adopt the present motion , and
