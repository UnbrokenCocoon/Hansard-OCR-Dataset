: he accepted the kingly power , mutilated as it was , rather than permit the constitution to be further mutilated . I have said , that I could urge reasons that peculiarly call upon the House to adopt a measure like that which I shall have the honour of suggesting ; but I am unwilling now to enter into any arising from peculiarities of situation . I shall leave the minds of gentlemen to suggest those inducements , only entreating them to recollect , that the greatest evil , the most dreadful calamity that the history of this country presents , arose out of a dispute regarding the succession of the crown , and that by not decidedly maintaining the constitution as it has been happily established in this respect , consequences equally fatal , calamities equally horrible may again be endured . My object is to guard against such dreadful results , and the House is called upon by a proper sense of its duty to guard the people of these realms against circumstances that may enable the minister of the day , on a pretended plea of necessity , to subvert the constitution , and usurp the government of the country . Such , Sir , is the object of the motion with which I shall conclude , but at the same time I have taken care , by the general terms I have employed , not to tie down the House to any distinct proposition , that may to me appear necessary , and which I shall feel it my duty to suggest . My motion will simply be for leave to bring in a Bill `` to provide against any interruption in the exercise of the royal authority , in the event of the death of his royal highness the Prince Regent , during the continuance of his Majesty 's malady ; '' but I have no hesitation in stating , that in my view , it will be right to give to the Regent powers as uncontrouled as those that belong to the King himself : the principles upon which I conceive this step should be taken is , that the incapacity proceeding from insanity is like every other species of incapacity , even that of personal disease , an utter vacating of the government . I have always , Sir , understood that the 711 office of king is not according to the constitution vested for the benefit of the individual filling the throne , but that it is a trust exercised for the advantage of the people , and in this view it is of great consequence that it should never cease : it is a principle which none of the gentlemen of the long robe ( of whom we have many in this House ) will dispute , that the crown , according to the common law , knows neither infancy nor insanity , or any other cause that can incapacitate the person holding it to discharge his important duties , and if such cause do exist , it must be viewed in the same light , and treated in the same way , as the natural death of the monarch . If insanity should unhappily visit the sovereign , the authority , I submit , by the law of the land , immediately devolves upon the successor , without the interference , much less without the election of any set of persons that may be anxious to usurp powers that to them do not belong . Such is the plain , obvious , simple , and legal mode of proceeding , which will meet all possible circumstances , and preserve the various branches of the constitution independent of each other . It would be idle in me to occupy the attention of the House , by noticing the many vague reports that have been circulated , with regard to my intentions and object in bringing forward the present motion . Some persons have regarded it as if I were actuated by a spirit of hostility towards his royal highness the Prince Regent . I can safely say , that I
