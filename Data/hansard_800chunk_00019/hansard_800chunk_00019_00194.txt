to the House of Lords appointing a committee or delegation of its members , such a measure would also be repugnant , to the constitution ; and he apprehended that a further sitting of the whole House was not to be expected from its diligence . Indeed they had no right to expect from the House of Lords , that they would depart from their usual habits of sitting ; and the evil would not be remedied by it even were their lordships to consent , instead of five months to sit for twice that term , unless gentlemen were prepared to encounter the other evil , namely , that the Lord Chancellor should not be the presiding officer in the House of Peers . Without this , the remedy thus projected would be only to exchange one evil for another , and transfer the arrears from the House of Lords to the Court of Chancery , by occupying the time of the Lord Chancellor in the former , which , during the recess , he now devoted to the latter.—With respect to the project for withdrawing the Lord Chancellor from presiding in the appellant jurisdiction , it was not necessary to go into detail . As far as he had watched the discussions upon this subject , no question had been made as to the separation of the office of Speaker from that of Chancellor , which had been formerly so long litigated and favourably considered by some high authorities , in the noble lord 's opinion erroneously , as tending to cast a shade upon the dignity of the presidency of the House of Peers . The first statesmen who had turned their attention to this point , had unanimously agreed in opinion , that such an alteration would derogate from the dignity of the House . It was also evident that no other individual 462 could be found to discharge this laborious duty . No doubt there were several eminent peers capable of performing this , but it was too much to think of building a permanent measure upon the existence or conveniency of peers , not of necessity bound so to devote themselves to the public service . It had been objected to the present measure , that it would tend to alter the habits of the Chancellor , and by confining him to his appellant jurisdiction , deprive him of his Chancery knowledge ; but it might be answered , that the confinement of the officer to the jurisdiction in the House of Peers , would equally deprive him of such a knowledge of the equity and practice of Chancery as would enable him to come to competent decisions upon those cases which came before that House as a court of appeal : so that the evil complained of could not be cured without a violation of the principles of the constitution , or the creation of a correspondent evil . If this were true ( and the noble lord knew of no flaw in its reasoning , ) the question was from what quarter could aid be drawn ; and , in his opinion , it was only from that now proposed that aid could be drawn safely and with advantage . The question then was , ( there being a necessity to provide some aid in the Court of Chancery ) whether it could be drawn from the other courts of law , or whether they must erect a new officer ? In the Court of Chancery itself there was a great if not a growing arrear—a great calamity for which there appeared to be no remedy , unless by creating a correspondent evil elsewhere , for if the Lord Chancellor had not called in aid the assistance of the Master of the Rolls , it was only because that could not be done without creating a corresponding evil in the Rolls Court . None of the other courts were in a situation to afford help , but were all so pressed with business that the judges , with all the diligence they used , could not cope with the excess , and
