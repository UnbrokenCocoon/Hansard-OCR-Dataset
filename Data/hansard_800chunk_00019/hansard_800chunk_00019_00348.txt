, neither am I hereby required to believe or profess , that the Pope is infallible , or that I am bound to obey any order , in its own nature 758 immoral , though the Pope , or any ecclesiastical power , should issue or direct such order , but , on the contrary , I hold , that it would be sinful in me to pay any respect or obedience thereto : I further declare , that I do not believe , that any sin whatever committed by me can be forgiven , at the mere will of any Pope , or any person or persons whatsoever ; but that sincere sorrow for past sins , a firm and sincere resolution to avoid future guilt , and to atone to God , are previous and indispensable requisites to establish a well-founded expectation of forgiveness ; and that any person who receives absolution , without those previous requisites , so far from obtaining thereby any remission of his sins , incurs the additional guilt of violating a sacrament ; and I do swear , that I will defend , to the utmost of my power , the settlement and arrangement of property in this country , as established by the laws now in being ; I do hereby disclaim , disavow , and solemnly abjure , any intention to subvert the present Church establishment , for the purpose of substituting a Catholic establishment in its stead ; and I do hereby solemnly swear , that I will not exercise any privilege to which I am or may become entitled , to disturb and weaken the Protestant religion and Protestant government in this kingdom.—So help me God . '' But the oath of the 33d of the King , which is particular to Ireland , I beg the House to pay every attention to : — `` I , A .
