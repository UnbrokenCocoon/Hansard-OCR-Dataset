to prevent a declaration of hostilities on the part of the United States of America , and that no course has been subsequently found practicable for averting the heavy calamity of war with that power , consistently with the honour and dignity of his Majesty 's crown and the welfare of the state . `` To pray his Royal Highness will be graciously pleased to cause all the correspondence which has passed between the ministers of the crown , and the persons authorized , on the part of the American government , to be laid before this House , in order that we may be enabled to form a just and well-grounded opinion on the conduct of his Majesty 's ministers , in the progress and termination of a negociation , which has ended in a manner so deeply to be deplored . `` To assure his Royal Highness that we shall apply ourselves with anxious attention to the important interests of Ireland ; and that we will redeem the pledge given by the last House of Commons , at the conclusion of its last session , and will , early in the present session , take into our serious 102 consideration the state of the laws affecting the Roman Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland ; with a view to such final and conciliatory adjustment as may be conducive to the peace and strength of the United Kingdom , to the stability of the Protestant establishment , and to the general satisfaction and concord of all classes of his Majesty 's subjects . `` To assure his Royal Highness that we will resume the consideration of the causes of the increasing depreciation of the paper currency of the kingdom , and the state of the law respecting the metallic currency , which instead of answering its intended purpose , appears to have created a still greater scarcity of the precious metals , and recommend such measures as shall appear to us the best adapted to retrieve the credit of the country , and to remedy the numerous evils to our national prosperity with which the extension of this system is fraught . `` That we will apply ourselves with all diligence and sincerity , to the great work of retrenchment and reform , so loudly demanded by a suffering people , and so essentially necessary to our preservation as a great and independent power . `` To assure his Royal Highness that we are determined to support the honour of his Majesty 's crown against all aggressions , and by every needful sacrifice ; but that when we are called upon to impose fresh burthens upon the people of these kingdoms sinking under an accumulation of taxes , and oppressed by circumstances of unusual privation and distress , we do implore his Royal Highness , at the conclusion of the nineteenth year of this most extensive war , which has for so long a time , almost uninterruptedly , desolated every part of Europe , to take such measures as to his Royal Highness 's wisdom shall appear best , to ascertain whether it be not possible to procure the restoration of the blessings of peace .
