society order , they dignify with the name of the British constitution ; and the proposal to consider the best and most conciliatory mode of correcting it , they cry down as a dangerous and presumptuous innovation . Sir , the Catholics propose no innovation . They ask for an equal share , as fellow subjects , in the constitution , as they 800 find it ; in that constitution , in whose original stamina they had an undisputed right , before there was a Reformation and before there was a Revolution , and before the existence of the abuses , which induced the necessity of either . They desire to bear its burthens , to share its dangers , to participate its glory , and to abide its fate ; they bring , as an offering , their hearts and hands , their lives and fortunes , but they desire also the privilege of bringing with them their consciences , their religion , and their honour , without which they would be worthless and dangerous associates . The position , therefore , to be maintained , by those who say that the first principles of the constitution are in opposition to the claim , is rather a critical one . They must shew why it is that a Roman Catholic may vote for a member to sit in parliament , and yet may not himself be a member of it ; why he may be the most powerful and wealthy subject in the realm , and the greatest landed proprietor , and yet may not fill the lowest office , in the meanest town upon his estates ; why he may be the first advocate at the bar , and be incapable of acting as one of the counsel of his sovereign ; why he may be elector , military officer , grand juror , corporator , magistrate , in Ireland , where the danger , if any , is immense , and why none of them in England , where the causes of apprehension are comparatively trifling and insignificant . Besides all this , arguing , as they do , that their religion necessarily includes hostility to the state , on the very points which , by the oaths which they have taken , are solemnly disavowed , they must shew the safety of harbouring , in the bosom of the state , and admitting to its essential and substantial benefits , a body of men whose only title to admission has been perjury ; that is , a body of men , who , in addition to religious opinions inconsistent with our particular constitution , have violated the solemn-obligations , which bind man to man , and therefore are unworthy of being admitted into any society , in which the sacred principles of society intercourse are respected . Sir , if these things are so , the petitions of the public should be , not to be protected against the dangers which are to come , but to be rescued from those , which have already been incurred ! nay , more , if oaths are not regarded , we should not rely on the vain securities , which our ancestors have resorted to , and which consist of oaths , and only of oaths ; but we 801 should devise some new means of proving their religion , by the testimony of others , and chaining them down to it , without the possibility of disowning or escaping from it . But let us examine , somewhat more accurately , these supposed principles of public policy , which oppose an insuperable bar to the admission of the Roman Catholic . They join issue on this point : so far as concession is inconsistent with the true principles of the constitution , the safety of the established church , and of the Protestant throne , they admit that they are entitled to nothing ; so far as it is not inconsistent , they claim to be entitled to every thing . Let it be shewn that these great foundations of our liberties and of our civil and
