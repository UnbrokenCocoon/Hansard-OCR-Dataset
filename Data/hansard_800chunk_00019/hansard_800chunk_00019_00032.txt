his gracious intention of laying a copy of this Treaty before us as soon as the ratifications shall have been exchanged ; and that we trust the object will be attained which his Royal Highness has had in view , of providing for the more extensive application of the military force of the Sicilian government to offensive operations against the common enemy : `` That whilst we learn from his Royal Highness , that the declaration of war by the government of the United States of America was made under circumstances which might have afforded a reasonable expectation that the amicable relations between the two nations would not long be interrupted , we participate in the regret expressed by his Royal Highness , that the conduct and pretensions of that government have hitherto prevented the conclusion of any pacific arrangement : `` That we rejoice to learn , that notwithstanding the measures of hostility which have been principally directed against the adjoining British provinces , and the efforts which have been made to seduce the inhabitants of them from their allegiance to his Majesty , his Royal Highness has received such satisfactory proofs of loyalty and attachment from his Majesty 's subjects in North America , and that 58 the attempts of the enemy to invade Upper Canada have not only proved abortive , but that by the judicious arrangements of the governor general , and by the skill and decision with which the military operations have been conducted , the forces of the enemy assembled for that purpose in one quarter have been compelled to capitulate , and in another have been defeated with considerable loss : `` To assure his Royal Highness , that we fully rely on the exertion of his best efforts for the restoration of the relations of peace and amity between the two countries , but that until this object can be attained , without sacrificing the maritime rights of Great Britain , his Royal Highness may rely upon our cordial support in the vigorous prosecution of the war : `` To return our humble thanks to his Royal Highness , for having directed the estimates for the services of the ensuing year to be laid before us ; and to assure his Royal Highness , that we will readily furnish such supplies as may be necessary to enable him to provide for the great interests committed to his charge , and to afford the best prospect of bringing the contest in which his Majesty is engaged to a successful termination : `` That we will not fail to take into our early consideration the propriety of providing effectually for the future government of the provinces of India , and that in considering the variety of interests which are connected with this important subject , our best efforts will be employed in making such an arrangement , as may best promote the prosperity of the British possessions in that quarter , and at the same time secure the greatest advantages to the commerce and revenue of his Majesty 's dominions : `` That we sincerely participate in the satisfaction expressed by his Royal Highness at the success of the measures adopted for suppressing the spirit of outrage and insubordination which had appeared in some parts of the country , and at the disposition which has been manifested to take advantage of the indemnity held out to the deluded by the wisdom and benevolence of parliament : we trust that his Royal Highness will never have occasion to lament the recurrence of atrocities so repugnant to the British character ; and that all his Majesty 's subjects will be impressed with the conviction that the happiness of individuals , and the welfare of the state , equally depend upon a strict 59 obedience to the laws , and an attachment to our excellent constitution : `` That his Royal Highness may be assured , that the same firmness and perseverance which have been manifested on so many and such trying occasions , will not be wanting at a time when the eyes of all Europe and the world are fixed upon us ; and that
