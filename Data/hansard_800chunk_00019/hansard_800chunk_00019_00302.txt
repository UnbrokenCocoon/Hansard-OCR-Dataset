one of the Resolutions of the Catholic meeting at Kilkenny , in order to prove the determination they had expressed , not to consent to any arrangement for securities to the Protestant establishment . deprecated the idea of treating with the Catholics as with an independent power . It was for the legislature to consider their claims , and make such enactments as to its wisdom should seem meet , and it was for the Catholics as subjects to obey . He could not , therefore , see any reason why the noble earl should have altered his opinion on the policy of the measure , merely because certain resolutions had been passed by some Catholics in some part of a county in Ireland . also presented a Petition to the same effect from the Protestants of the county of Tipperary , which was read . did not mean to object to its lying on the table ; but he thought these Petitions making allegations against the Catholics were scarcely regular , when 658 no Petition from any part of that body had yet been presented for the purpose of urging any claims . observed , that the proceedings of the Catholics for the purpose of urging their claims were notorious ; that they had been published in all the newspapers of Ireland ; and productions , avowedly by their authority , had been published , in which their claims had been set forth . lamented the tone of these Petitions , which he thought would only lead to corresponding acrimony on the part of the Catholics . presented a Petition from the gentlemen , clergy , & c. of the county and town of Carlow .
