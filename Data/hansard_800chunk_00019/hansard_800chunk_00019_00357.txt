lowest orders of the Roman Catholics but ill brook a Protestant government , is but too true ; that they have been so familiarised with discontent as to be ever ready to manifest its spirit , as opportunity should offer , we have had too many melancholy examples ; —but it is not for what is commonly called Catholic emancipation alone that they have renounced their allegiance ; it is not for Catholic emancipation alone that they have invited a foreign enemy to their shores ; it is not for Catholic emancipation that so many endeavours have been been made to assert the independence of Ireland , and create a total separation from this country . Catholic emancipation is a term to which , if they attach any meaning at all , they attach a very different meaning from its general acceptation in this country : but it is a powerful engine , in the hands of a crafty priesthood , and the more dangerous , from being ambiguous and undefined in its precise signification—a stalking horse to mislead the ignorant , to deceive the moderate , and blind the well disposed ; but whose concealed poison is well understood by the turbulent and disaffected : and , if attained , it will be the ground for insisting upon farther encroachments , a step towards the ultimate fulfilment of their wishes . 772 The events of the last forty years most abundantly prove that , if concessions would gratify their wishes , if lenity would insure their gratitude , or kindness conciliate their affections , there would now have been a noble and generous ardour amongst them to prove that their hearts were as closely united , as their interests are inseparably interwoven with this country : but every indulgence has been the parent of fresh demands , and success has only encouraged their ambition ; not content with the repeal of all the penal laws , not satisfied with the enjoyment of greater privileges than any Catholic state ever allowed , either individually or collectively , to persons of a different persuasion , they boldly arraign the justice of the state , for insisting upon the continuance of any civil distinctions , though so wide a difference must exist in all spiritual matters . They disdain the language of petition and assume the tone of demand ; they enjoy , as a right , the privileges which have been conceded , and scorn all idea of obligation . They no longer ask , as an indulgence , but claim as their undoubted right , a right inherent in them as British subjects , the unqualified repeal of all disabling statutes , the unqualified abolition of all religious tests ! But , while the faith which a man may profess , shall be considered as having any influence upon his general conduct , while soundness in religious principles shall be allowed to be the best security for moral integrity , and the most powerful incentive to an active and conscientious discharge of every society and political duty , so long may we hope that some religious test will be required from those who are placed in the most important public situations , and are entrusted with the protection and support of our invaluable constitution ! Let me not be misunderstood , in any thing which I have said , as involving , in indiscriminate censure , the whole mast of the Roman Catholics ; far be it from me to draw no distinction between passive instruments and active leaders—far be it from me to include , in the same sentence , the deluded victims of ignorance with the daring abettors of wickedness . It is not the people of Ireland whom I would reproach , chained as they are by implicit obedience to their spiritual guides ; it is not the people of Ireland whom I would fear , were they not subservient to the same controlling influence . Those only would I reproach who have not ignorance to 773 plead in their excuse , but who pervert the advantages of education , and abuse the talents of nature ;
