immediate concession , was the result of some very exaggerated statement of a favourable inclination towards their claim existing in the mind of that person whose favour would contribute the most powerfully to give it effect . But when we recollect how widely that misrepresentation was diffused—so widely that , I believe , there was hardly an individual in this House , that did not more or less be deceived by it , we shall not be surprized if the Catholics , who were the most interested in the event , and who could not be expected nicely and suspiciously to weigh the testimony in favour of that which they must have been so anxious to believe , —lent too ready an ear to these flattering accounts , and if their exasperation at finding them to be false was proportioned to the satisfaction with which they had received them as true : and if in the first moments of their disappointment they should have broken out into some expressions of resentment , the worst consequence of which will be that of giving to their adversaries an opportunity , too favourable to be missed , of misrepresenting their whole conduct and dispositions to the English public . Sir , many other topics naturally present themselves to one 's mind , but I will now conclude , asking pardon for having already trespassed so long upon your time . But I confess I was anxious even at the hazard of wearying the House to explain the view I take of this question , and the more so because I have hitherto contented myself with a silent but sincere vote , although during ten years that I have sat in parliament it has been frequently and eagerly discussed , and although there is no cause in which I am more strongly engaged both by the feelings of my heart and the conviction of my understanding . And , Sir , if this House , concurring in the motion of my right hon . friend , shall this 940 night resolve to do that which is alike required by the justice of the case and by the situation of the country , I shall rejoice , I do not mean to have contributed to that event for I am well aware that I can contribute to it no otherwise than by my vote , but to have borne testimony in favour of a great measure of religious liberty and political wisdom . If on the other hand their decision should be unfavourable , and it should become , as I am persuaded it will become , the source of great and irreparable evils , it will be to me some consolation , suffering under those evils in common with their authors , thus publicly and solemnly to have absolved myself from all participation in their origin . said , he feared he could hardly think himself authorised in trespassing on the indulgence of the House , more particularly as he was fully aware of the anxiety and importance with which every one must look forward to the decision of this question ; but , as a native of Ireland , and feeling himself most deeply concerned in what related so essentially to the peace and happiness of his countrymen , he hoped he should not be deemed presumptuous in stating very briefly his sentiments . From every view he had been enabled to take of the subject , and from any experience which a residence in his native country might have afforded him , he was most decidedly of opinion that there was no one question so much calculated to strengthen the resources of Great Britain and to raise Ireland to that rank in the scale of the empire to which her natural advantages entitled her . It could not be for our interest that , when every energy should be exerted in resistance to the attacks of a common enemy , the right arm of the empire should be paralyzed by the incapacities under which the majority of the population of Ireland suffered .
