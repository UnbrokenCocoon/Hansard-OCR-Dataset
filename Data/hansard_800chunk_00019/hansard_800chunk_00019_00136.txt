of the House to the infraction of the law of the land , which was committed by the introduction of foreign officers into native regiments ; it will be also recollected , that the consequence of the motion I then made was the production of returns which , though regular in their form , were imperfect in their essence : as they included only the foreign officers on home service , and did not embrace those employed abroad ; the reason assigned for the imperfection being , that it was found impossible to ascertain , within the time specified , the number of officers of the description in question who were engaged in the latter service . In consequence of this defect , one of my objects to night is , to obtain the information I then sought to a greater extent than I could then obtain it , to ascertain the total number of foreign officers who have been introduced into our native corps , and also to ascertain the number of such officers employed upon the staff ; for the House will bear in mind , that it has been provided by an express statute , that even the officers of the 60th regiment , who are chiefly foreigners , shall not be capable of holding staff employments . The circumstance , Sir , upon which I grounded my notice of motion was , an Order which issued from the Horse-Guards in August last , and which I deem it necessary to read to the House , as it appeared in the Gazette on the 18th of that month . It is as follows : — '' War-Office , August 18 , 1812.—MEMORANDUM .

The law limits the duration of the services of the German Legion to the period of the war and twelve months after , but it would seem to be the intent of this Order in defiance of the statute to render the existence of that corps permanent . It is possible , Sir , that the Order in question may receive a different interpretation from that which I give it , from the noble lord opposite ; and , therefore , in order that I may not occupy the attention of the House needlessly , before I proceed further , I shall beg leave to ask the noble lord whether I have correctly understood the drift of the Order , for without some explanation on that head , I might found argument on what would possibly turn out to be a complete misconception . begged the noble lord would repeat his construction of the words of the Order . proceeded . I am sorry I have not been fortunate enough to make myself understood to the noble lord ; but to be as plain as I can , my object is to know , whether the Order be intended to give to the foreign officers foisted into our service ( I do not use the expression in an invidious sense ) all the advantages enjoyed by British officers ?
