course of the present year : `` That we have observed , with the utmost satisfaction , the valour and intrepidity displayed by his Majesty 's forces , and those of his allies in the peninsula , on so many occasions during this campaign , and the consummate skill and judgment with which the operations have been conducted by general the marquis of Wellington , 56 and which have led to consequences of the utmost importance to the common cause : `` To congratulate his Royal Highness on the glorious and ever-memorable victory obtained by that illustrious officer at Salamanca , by which great achievement , and by the other operations which have transferred the war into the interior of Spain , he has compelled the enemy to raise the siege of Cadiz , and the southern provinces of that kingdom have been delivered from the power and arms of France ; that while we regret that the efforts of the enemy , combined with a view to one great operation , have rendered it necessary to withdraw from the siege of Burgos , and to evacuate Madrid , for the purpose of concentrating the main body of the allied forces , it is satisfactory to reflect that these efforts of the enemy have nevertheless been attended with important sacrifices on their part , which we trust will materially contribute to extend the resources and facilitate the exertions of the Spanish nation : `` To assure his Royal Highness , that we are determined to continue to afford every aid in support of a contest which has first given to the continent of Europe the example of persevering and successful resistance to the power of France , and on which not only the independence of the nations of the peninsula , but the best interests of his Majesty 's dominions essentially depend . `` To return his Royal Highness our humble thanks , for having been graciously pleased to direct copies of the Treaties between his Majesty and the courts of Saint Petersburgh and Stockholm , to be laid before us , and to assure his Royal Highness that we participate in the pleasure expressed by his Royal Highness at the restoration of the relations of peace and friendship with those courts : `` That we have observed , with sentiments of the highest admiration , the resistance which has been opposed by the emperor of Russia to so large a proportion of the military power of France , assisted by its allies and by the tributary states dependent upon it , in a contest for his own sovereign rights , and for the independence of his dominions : by his imperial majesty 's magnanimity and perseverance , by the zeal and disinterestedness of all ranks of his subjects , and by the gallantry , firmness , and intrepidity of his forces , the presumptuous expectations of the enemy have been signally disappointed : the enthusiasm 57 of the Russian nation has increased with the difficulties of the contest , and with the dangers with which they were surrounded : they have submitted to sacrifices of which there are few examples in the history of the world , and we indulge the confident hope that the determined perseverance of his imperial majesty will be crowned with ultimate success , and that this contest , in its result , will have the effect of establishing , upon a foundation never to be shaken , the security and independence of the Russian empire : `` That we learn with peculiar satisfaction the proof of confidence which his Royal Highness has received from his imperial majesty , in the measure which he has adopted of sending his fleets to the ports of this country , as well as the determination expressed by his Royal Highness to afford his imperial majesty the most cordial support in the great contest in which he is engaged : `` That we rejoice to find that his Royal Highness has concluded a Treaty with his Sicilian majesty supplementary to the treaties of 1808 and 1809 , and to return our humble thanks to his Royal Highness , for
