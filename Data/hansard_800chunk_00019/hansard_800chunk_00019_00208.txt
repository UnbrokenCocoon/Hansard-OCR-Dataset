was true that out of the whole number of Appeals , the enormous proportion of 4 5ths were from Scotland . From the first report it appeared that out of 253 Appeals , 200 were from that country . The Bill , in his opinion , was prematurely brought forward . Two acts had been passed which must contribute to lessen the number of Appeals from the Court of Session of Scotland . The operation of these acts could not be yet sufficiently known , and it was on this account that he considered the Bill premature . It was not known , nor could it be yet known , whether the evil proposed to be removed was temporary or permanent . He could not look upon the Bill as tending to less than a dissolution of the first judicial officer of the country . With respect to the Appeals in the Lords , 19 out of 20 were merely vexatious , and many of the Scotch Appeals were merely on account of delay . The attendance of a sufficient number of lords could , in his opinion , be secured by a compulsory order of their own . It was said that the increase of business in the Court of Chancery and the House of Lords , arose from the increase of wealth . For his part , he thought it depended more on the unsettled state of the law , and on the distresses of the nation . He conjured the House not to loosen the only tie which bound the Chancellor to the people . The number of motions did not , in his mind , furnish any reason for the delay in passing from one to another . It was well known that any sudden check to wealth , particularly to commercial wealth , occasioned an increase of litigation . It was asserted , that no mischief could arise from thus withdrawing a part of his duties from the Chancellor . It would at least lessen his intercourse with the public ; and that daily and hourly intercourse was , in his opinion , one of the most effectual means for preserving him in the discharge of those duties . thought there was no measure more likely to produce the desired effect than that now before the House . It was said truly from the opposite side , that the number of Appeals 483 amounted nearly to a denial of justice . The hon . gentleman who spoke last , thought that a permanent remedy was not necessary , because there was a probability that the Scotch Appeals would be considerably lessened ; but he did not consider the great number that was already depending from that country , and that those from Ireland were to be added , which amounted at present to 52 . He saw no likelihood that Appeals would decrease , because litigation always augmented with the augmentation of property . It was said , that this Bill would alter the character of the Chancellor ; and that he would become , in consequence of it , nothing more than a state officer . But the House should not forget the weight of legal duties that would still remain upon himâ€”that he would sit for the discharge of business three days in every week during the session of parliament , and every day when parliament was not sitting . With respect to the separation of the business of bankrupts from the Lord Chancellor , it was liable to most grave and insurmountable objections . If his bankruptcy jurisdiction were to be withdrawn , no greater innovation could be introduced ; bankruptcy proceeded from the great seal , and to change it would be to introduce a change in the original jurisdiction . Another reason against such an innovation was , that in cases of bankruptcy there ought to be no appeal , from the necessity there existed of distributing as speedily as possible the property of the bankrupt . They could not , therefore , entrust this most important function to an inferior officer , or place the decision of so great
