the pay attendant upon which situation was not less than 8,000l . a year , when asked to accept that pay , he answered , that whatever services were in his power , he would be always willing to perform for Portugal ; but as he received the pay of his own sovereign , he would not accept of it from another . The pay had been suffered to accumulate in the expectation that his feelings might at some time be prevailed upon to accept it . He was apprised that the money was to be delivered to him , but with a generosity never before excelled , with the noble self-denial of a soldier , he begged it should be disposed of for the Portuguese army.—Reverting to the system of the French army , the noble lord observed , that not only were the successful officers of that army rewarded with such honours as could be bestowed on them , but with possessions ( which it was a disgrace to accept ) granted out of the countries which they had devastated , in pursuance of that unjustifiable principle on which modern France had uniformly acted , of making the territory of one sovereign afford the means of desolating the dominions of another—Happily a different system pre- 205 vailed , and he trusted would ever prevail in this country . The troops of Great . Britain went forth to fight for the interests and tranquillity of other nations as well as of their own ; and their officers , although they might accept the honours conferred on them by the legitimate sovereigns of the countries in whose cause they were contending , were not disposed to avail themselves of any pecuniary advantage , unless it flowed from the country to which they belonged.—He now came to consider what , under all the circumstances of the case , it appeared to him to be becoming in parliament to grant in the present instance . If he had to consider lord Wellington 's services in a similar point of view to that which called forth the munificence of parliament on a former occasion—if he had to consider them under circumstances similar to those under which lord Nelson 's services had been considered—if such a calamity had occurred as the death of the noble marquis ( and no greater calamity could befall the country than the loss of such a treasure ) ; 'if the noble marquis were by such a melancholy occurrence put out of the reach of the further favour of the crown and the further notice of parliament , he should then , in submitting a proposition to the Committee on behalf of the noble marquis 's family , be influenced by a very different feeling ; but , considering that lord Wellington was comparatively young in the service , considering that he was placed in a great crisis , which had , indeed , principally arisen out of the noble lord 's own exertions in the peninsula ; considering that he might yet render important advantages to his country and to the world , he was not willing , however high his merit , that the honours of the crown and the bounty of parliament should be at once exhausted upon him . Under these circumstances he was anxious to submit to the Committee such a proposition as should at once mark their sense of his great and glorious services , and their recollection that he might , and in all probability would , experience the further favour of the sovereign and the further bounty of parliament . An additional motive to a concurrence in the vote which he should have the honour to propose , and which he was sure that the Committee would seize with avidity , was , that by a happy coincidence of circumstances , the manor of Wellington , from which the noble lord derived his title , had passed from its former owner 206 into the possession of an individual who would be too happy , if parliament agreed to the proposed vote , to surrender it in order that it might be
