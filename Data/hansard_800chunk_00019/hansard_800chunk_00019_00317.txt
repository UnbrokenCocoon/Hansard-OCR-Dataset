, then , to me , that violent encroachments have been made upon the true principles and frame of the constitution of this country , by those measures that have been adopted in consequence of the unfortunate affliction under which his Majesty is suffering . The first encroachment occurred in the year 1788 , the whole of which proceedings always appeared to me an unwarrantable departure from the principles of the constitution , and though I should be unwilling to introduce any personal animadversions , though I do not wish to attribute blame to any individual , yet I can not avoid in general terms asserting that those proceedings seemed to me to originate in the violence of faction , and to have been supported and adopted with no other view than to keep power in the hands of the party then in office , without any regard to the interests of the state , or respect to the legal government of the country . At that period the constitutional and safe though not the successful doctrine , was maintained on the one side , that upon failure of the capacity of the person filling the throne , the exercise of the functions of royalty immediately devolved upon the heir apparent . On the other hand this simple and obvious position was denied , and it was insisted that the heir apparent to the , crown had no more right to the government of the nation than any other subject in the King 's dominions . In the strict legal acceptation of the word 'right , ' there certainly was no right , because there was no law , and where there is no law there can be no right ; but upon parity of reasoning ; upon every principle of propriety and expediency , there could be no doubt of the line of conduct that ought to be pursued : nothing could be more obvious than to follow that example , to which the faction seemed blind , that had been set at the glorious Revolution in 1688 . If the proceedings of parliament had been governed by that wholesome precedent , ministers would not have been allowed for five months to take into their own hands the government of the country , instead of an odious oligarchy for that period being usurped by the executive , there would have been no suspension of the powers of the crown , no departure from the leading principles of the constitution . The steps , however , taken in 1788 were justified on 708 the plea of necessity . I have been always taught to believe that the exercise of the functions of the crown formed an essential part of the constitution ; I have been always taught to believe that there are two grand leading principles that govern , in my opinion , the whole of this question : First , that the powers and prerogatives annexed by the common law to the crown , and which I conceive to be unquestionable , descend by hereditary succession , and not by election : Second , that its powers are never suspended ; the functions of royalty never cease , for if they were for any period terminated it would be a destruction of one part of the three essential branches of the constitution , and a total dissolution of the legal government . At the period to which I have referred , it appears to me that these two great leading principles were unnecessarily and unwarrantably departed from . The great danger resulting from once admitting the plea of necessity is obvious , from subsequent experience , for in the year 1810 this mischievous precedent was followed , when I had the honour , though unsuccessfully , of resisting it throughout , and of supporting the principles for which I now contend . In 1810 the violent usurpation was renewed , and that which ought to have been considered as a beacon to warn ministers from a dangerous coast was mistaken for a sure light to guide them in safety to harbour . Unfortunately , from the evidence of the
