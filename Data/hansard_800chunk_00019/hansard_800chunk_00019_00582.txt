evidence of sir John Douglas , and of Charlotte , his wife , if again called for , would still retain all its legal character and weight , while it might happen , that the evidence on the other side might , from death or other causes , be found deficient ; and that there can be no doubt that if it should hereafter be made to appear that the facts sworn to by lady Douglas are true , and if the identity of the male child so born should be proved , he would be the legal heir to the throne , notwithstanding any assertions , or any proofs , relating to the alleged illicit intercourse of her royal highness the Princess of Wales . `` That therefore the honour of her royal highness the Princess of Wales , the sacred right of the Princess Charlotte of Wales , the safety of the throne , and the tranquillity of the country , do all unite , in most imperious call on this House , to institute now , while the witnesses on both sides are still living , and while all the charges are capable of being clearly established , or clearly disproved , an ample and impartial investigation of all the allegations , facts , and circumstances appertaining to this most important subject of inquiry . `` Resolved , II .
