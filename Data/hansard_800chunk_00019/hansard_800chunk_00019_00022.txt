the resources for such extended operation could be found.—As to the Sicilian expedition , he had to state that it was prepared to sail early in March , and conducted throughout in concert with lord Wellington , who communicated regularly with the commander of that force . The appearance of this expedition off Catalonia , 42 was , he was assured , of great utility , as it prevented Suchet from sending reinforcements to Joseph Buonaparté , who in consequence evacuated Madrid , and the arrival of this expedition at Valencia , instead of being a mistake , as asserted , was the result of plan and orders . That the late campaign had eminently succeeded , he was also prepared to prove . For what way the plan of the campaign—why , the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz—the expulsion of the French from the south of Spain , and the raising of the siege of Cadiz , and all these objects had been attained ; and would not that man have been deemed very sanguine , who at the outset would have predicted the attainment of such important objects , particularly the liberation of the Spanish government , by the raising of the siege of Cadiz ? In stating that the objects of the campaign had been accomplished he would not deny , that many of the hopes excited by the victory of Salamanca , had been disappointed . But that disappointment was not attributable to any want of energy on the part of his Majesty 's government ; nor was the conduct or scarcity of artillery at Burgos , so much dwelt upon by the noble marquis , any imputation upon government : for the fact was , there were three battering trains on the continent ; and , besides these , one was sent last March to Lisbon , to be kept afloat , subject to the order of lord Wellington . According to the opinion , however , of the noble lord himself , Burgos must have been taken , if at all , without delay , and before any artillery could be brought to him . But the failure of our gallant commander 's calculation , and the consequent re-capture of Madrid , was owing to the refusal of Ballasteros to obey his commands ; which refusal facilitated the movements of the French force , and disconcerted lord Wellington 's plan of operations.—Upon the subject of Sweden he could not , from considerations of state delicacy , say much in reply to the noble marquis , but thus much he could state , that the most perfect confidence prevailed between the governments of Russia , Sweden , and this country , and that nothing dissatisfactory had taken place in the transaction alluded to by the noble marquis . As to the story about the transports , he could only assure the House that be never heard of such a matter before this evening , and the affair was altogether new to him.—Adverting to America , he begged 43 the noble marquis , before he again affirmed the insignificance of a repeal of the Orders in Council , in the estimation of the American government , to recollect the dispatches of the government , and his own dispatches when in office also , which he seemed to forget , and which clearly demonstrated that these very Orders in Council were the great stumbling block in the way of an amicable arrangement tween the countries . He begged of him to recollect that not only the act of the government but also the acts of congress expressly declared the repeal of the retaliatory measure , the Non-importation act , depended upon the rescinding of these Orders . As soon as that very measure should be adopted , which the noble marquis now insists the Americans regarded as insignificant , the American government proclaimed that their counter policy should cease to be enforced . When , however , the noble marquis asserted that we were unprepared for the American war , he would ask him to point out where and how we were unprepared ? Were we
