. It has already been the source of infinite jealousy and discord , to say nothing of greater misfortunes , and it is too much to promise oneself that under any arrangement that can be adopted , it will not interfere with the general harmony and prosperity of the kingdom . If three or four millions of Roman Catholics , or of any other dissenters ( supposing them to agree in one kind of dissent ) were distributed indifferently over both countries , it is probable that the feelings which as a sect they must entertain , would from time to time occasion some disagreement between them and the orthodox majority , but confined as they are to one island , which in point of population they may fairly call their own , having the `` litoralitoribus contraria '' uniting the national to the sectarian feeling , it is impossible not to anticipate dissentions which nothing but prudence in the government and forbearance in the leaders on both sides can prevent from producing the most serious consequences . Both in a religious and in a political point of view it would be fortunate for the whole empire , if both countries professed the reformed faith ; and in a purely political point of view , it would perhaps even be fortunate if they were both Catholic , but as we can not hope for the one and as we can not so much as wish for the other , what we have to consider is how we can best accommodate our laws to the actual and probable state of things , and how in a situation of some difficulty we can extricate ourselves with the smallest possible quantity of danger and inconvenience . The two objects then which in any arrangement that may be proposed to us we ought to keep in view , are , the pros- 925 perity of the state , and the security of the established religion . I say the two objects ; though I am by no means ignorant that the question may be argued upon higher grounds . Neither arguments nor authorities are wanting in support of a bolder doctrine ; namely , that no apprehensions we may entertain as to the security of what we believe to be the true faith , can justify us in imposing disadvantages of any kind upon persons of another religion . But this is not the point of view in which I shall discuss the subject ; because , be this principle true or be it false , I am sure it would neither be a prudent nor a successful way of pleading the Catholic cause ; to ask those who , belonging to the established church , of course believe it to be the depositary and the source of doctrines true and salutary to mankind , to legislate upon a matter of this sort with a view to temporals only . In order to satisfy them , and they have a right to be satisfied , it ought to be shewn ; not only that emancipation will promote the civil happiness of the country , but that it will not sap the foundation of that which they consider as far more valuable than any accession of prosperity . And therefore , Sir , if having succeeded in establishing one of these points ; if having proved ever so clearly that by abolishing the restrictive code we should become more wealthy , and more powerful , we failed in proving the other , and were forced to admit that strength and riches must be purchased at the price of endangering the Protestant religion , I for one should at once admit that we had failed in a most important part of our case , and were by no means in a situation in which we could reasonably call for the support of a Protestant parliament . But , Sir , I flatter myself that we are not placed in this painful and embarrassing dilemma , but that the measures which are necessary to the completion of our political prosperity will leave our religious establishments in a
