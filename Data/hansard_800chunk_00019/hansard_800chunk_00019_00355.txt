laws , enacted for the preservation of the national religion , can be oppressive , no conditions , annexed to the profession of a different religion , can be unjust , either in a moral or in a political point of view , provided they neither affect the freedom of the subject , nor diminish the security of his property ; provided they exclude him from none of the comforts of society life , and impose no restraint upon the liberty of conscience . It has been frequently said , and can not be too often repeated , that all offices are created , not for the benefit of individuals , but for the advantage of the public : and if the majority of those whose happiness is the object to be promoted , and whose sentiments and principles are to direct all the civil and political regulations , shall determine that , for certain situations artificially created , certain qualifications shall be necessary , those who shall be disqualified can have no reasonable cause to complain of hardship , nor of any real grievance : they may indeed , with justice , look for protection , but they ought not to expect confidence , being deficient in the very foundation of confidenceâ€”attachment to those provisions which would be entrusted to their care . If , then , the Roman Catholics can not claim these concessions as a right , is it expedient , as an abstract question of policy , that they should be conceded ? Here a field of discussion opens to our view , as 769 boundless in its extent , as it is important in its nature ; a labyrinth , through which we may travel in safety , if we will hearken to experience as our guide , but in whose intricate mazes we may continue for ever to wander , if we suffer ourselves to be beguiled by speculations , however plausible , or theories , however ingenious . I would not have trespassed , even for a moment , upon the time and patience of the House , by detailing those facts which so loudly and so unequivocally proclaim the spirit inculcated by the Roman Catholic religion , had it not been for the forcible and eloquent panegyric I have this evening heard , and heard with astonishment , pronounced upon that religion ; I am far from wishing to sound an alarm unnecessarily , but I can not , when I hear the voice of history speak one uniform , consistent language , be deaf to her warnings ; I can not misunderstand her admonitions . I entreat those who , advocate the cause of the Roman Catholics , to compare the persecuting spirit of their religion , with the benignant spirit of ours ; their principles favourable to despotism , with ours encouraging liberty ; their arrogant infallibility with our acknowledgment of the erroneousness of human judgment ; their inquisition with our trial by jury ; their rod of iron with our sceptre of olive ; and then say whether , upon the terms they propose , union can long exist , or harmony can long prevail . Recourse can no more be had to the excuse which was urged a few years since , that any change has taken place in the nature of their principles ; for , independently of the absurdity of supposing that infallible doctrines are liable to alteration , we have now the most positive and distinct assurances of their own writers , that their principles are unchanged and unchangeable , and therefore applicable at all times , and to all circumstances . I have said , if the proposals of the Roman Catholics are granted , harmony and concord can not long prevail ; but will they obtain even a temporary existence ? Will the . Roman Catholic gain in content , what we lose in security ? Will even a momentary cordial conciliation be effected ? A conciliation not confined to the narrow circle of those who will be immediately benefited , but which shall be generally and universally diffused through the people ?
