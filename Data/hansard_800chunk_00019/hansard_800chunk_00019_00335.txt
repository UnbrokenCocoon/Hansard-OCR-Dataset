as loyal , obedient , and peaceable subjects , to the state , they , in common with all their fellow citizens , may be put in possession of complete religious freedom , and allowed to worship their Maker , and maintain their Christian profession according to their own views , and their incumbent duty , without being subjected , under the sanction of law , to any penalties or disabilities , in consequence of their dissent from the Established Church ; and that the petitioners , confiding in the wisdom and justice of the House , pray that their cause may be taken into consideration , and the relief granted to them for which they supplicate . '' also presented a Petition from the there undersigned Protestant Dissenters , of the three denominations residing in and near the cities of London and Westminster : setting forth , 736 `` That the petitioners esteem the capacity for religious worship as the highest distinction of their nature , and regard the practice of it as a sacred duty enjoined by Divine authority , but . which can be acceptable in the individual only when performed with sincerity , and agreeably to the dictates of conscience ; that they are hereby inevitably led to deprecate the interference of the civil magistrate in religious concerns , and to consider the unfettered exorcise of private judgment in all matters thereto belonging as a right invaluable and unalienable , and which can not be innocently surrendered to the pretensions of any human authority ; and that , under these impressions , the petitioners are sincerely grateful for the important and progressive improvement of their condition in these points during the course of the present reign , and especially for the large concessions so graciously made in the last parliament ; but there are some laws yet remaining upon our statute book , which they can not but contemplate as inconsistent with the free exercise of religious worship , and which , if ever they deserved to be considered as proper guards against the dangers of any former periods , may now , even on their own principle , be safely abrogated , when those dangers have so long ceased to exist ; and that the petitioners therefore can not but indulge the hope , that the same wise and liberal spirit , the prevalence of which has already effected so much in their favour , will break every remaining bond , and abolish every shackle on the entire freedom of religious profession , and that they , in common with all their fellow subjects of every persuasion , may , while they conduct themselves as peaceable and obedient subjects , be permitted to reap the legitimate fruits of upright and loyal conduct in the allowance to maintain their Christian profession according to their own views of faith and duty , without being made liable to any legal pains , penalties , or disabilities , in consequence of their dissent from the Established Church . '' would not have made any observation on the present occasion , had not the hon . gentleman stated , that the unanimous opinion of the Dissenting Ministers was in favour of presenting this Petition . During the last session of parliament , 737 a proposition was made for presenting a petition , word for word with that which the hon . gentleman had now brought up . In favour of the proposition there were 31 ministers , against it 25 , and 12 were neuter ; so that , in fact , a majority of the body did not coincide in its propriety . It was not , however , deemed expedient for those who were opposed to the Petition , and who were a minority , to take any steps on the occasion . said , that of the private transactions of the body , he did not profess to know much ; but he would again aver , that the Petition was brought to him yesterday , by a deputation from the body of whom he spoke ; that the meeting was called with all due , sufficient
