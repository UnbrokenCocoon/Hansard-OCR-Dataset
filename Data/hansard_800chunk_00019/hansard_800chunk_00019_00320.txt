am influenced by no such feeling , and that , in all I have ever said or done in public , I have been actuated by a sentiment of respect for his Royal Highness , a respect proceeding from my confidence in those public principles to which he had preferred his attachment ; and my conviction that his Royal Highness was as ill-treated as any subject in the King 's dominions . I thought I saw in him a wish to unite more closely the common interests of the throne and the people , a desire of building the honour of the former on its only permanent and solid basis , the affections of his subjects . I looked upon him as the friend and advocate of those principles which his family was called into this country to maintain ; I indulged the hope that he would prove the restorer of the nation to that safety and prosperity which it formerly enjoyed , that its liberties would have been cherished by his fostering protection , 712 that his reign would have been blessed by those who happened to live under it , and regarded by posterity with gratitude and veneration . These , Sir , are the only feelings I ever indulged , and these are the only feelings I now entertain ; and for the motion I now offer , I have the authority of his Royal Highness himself , and I have nothing to do , but to read a passage from that excellent and eloquent letter written by him , in 1788 , to bring forward an advocate in this cause infinitely more able to do it justice than myself . In that production the Prince of Wales puts the argument in so strong , so clear , and so admirable a manner , that I can not forbear stating a part of it to the House . He says , `` the Prince holds it as an undoubted and fundamental principle of the constitution , that the powers and prerogatives of the crown are vested in trust and for the benefit of the people , and they are secured only as being necessary to preserve that poise and balance of the constitution , upon which experience has shewn , depend the true security and liberty of the subject . '' His Royal Highness then goes on to state the mischiefs that must inevitably result from mutilating the prerogatives of the crown , and exciting suspicion in the mind of the monarch ; he also makes various other complaints , and he declares that nothing but the anxious desire he feels to put an end to the anarchy then prevailing , could induce him to overcome his objections , and to try that experiment which he deprecates , `` with how little power the executive government of the country may be carried on . '' Unfortunately , since the date of this letter , another experiment has been tried in his person , under circumstances most disrespectful to his Royal Highness , and more injurious to the public : to prevent , therefore , the recurrence of such events ; to provide against contingencies ; to preserve that `` poise and balance of the constitution upon which experience has shewn depends the true security and liberty of the subject , '' and to defeat the usurpations of the legislature , in opposition to a particular statute , by which the penalties of a pr√¶munire are incurred by those who attempt to pass any measure without the consent of the King , is my design . I wish to interpose such a Bill that parliament shall never pass any measure , and on its own authority order the chancellor to affix what I must term the counterfeit great seal to it , 713 for the purpose of giving it an authority and sanctity which does not and never can belong to it . It would have been , I think , much more becoming to have supported the enactment on the authority of the legislature , without resorting to trick and chicanery for its maintenance . Various ,
