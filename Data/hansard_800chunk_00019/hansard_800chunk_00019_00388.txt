actions for the last century , and do not judge them by a few intemperate expressions or absurd publications , —these are not the views of statesmen , —you are considering the policy of centuries , and the fate of a people , and will you condescend to argue , on such a subject , the merits of a pamphlet , or to scan the indiscretions of an angry speaker at a public meeting ? Of this I am sure that , if the violence , with which the demand has been urged , by some of its advocates , is to create a prejudice against it , I the virulence , with which it has been rejected , by some of its opponents , ought to be allowed to have some operation in its favour ; perhaps under these opposite impulses of passion , a chance may be afforded of reason having fair play ; and a hearing may be procured for the merits of the case . This too should not be lost sight of , that the Catholics are seeking their rights ; that they are opposed by an adverse government , many of whom declare that no concession , on their part , could be effectual , but that their doom is interminable exclusion . May I ask , whether it is fair to require , or reasonable to expect , that the Catholics should , under such circumstances , exercise a fastidious delicacy , in the selection of their friends ; and say to those , who profess themselves their advocates , `` We refuse your aid , your language is not sufficiently measured ; you urge our demands in too warm and too unqualified a tone , and we prefer the chances , which may arise , from throwing ourselves on the mercy of our enemies ? '' Sir , I will not affect to disguise the fact , 818 that there are persons in Ireland , who look to revolution and separation . I certainly do not mean to say , nor do I believe , that those , whose warmth of expression has been so much , and so justly complained of , are , in the most remote degree , liable to the suspicion of being joined with such a party . The Separatists are , in my judgment , neither numerous , nor , in them-selves , formidable ; and , of this I am sure , that they tremble at the prospect of the adjustment of the Catholic claims , as a measure deadly to their views . Is it a wise policy , is it a course which any government can justify to the country , to recruit for these public enemies , by endeavouring to embody the legitimate claims of the Catholics with their wild and pernicious projects ? Is it not madness to oppose the same blind and indiscriminate resistance to the honest objects of the great untainted landed and commercial interests of the Catholic people , and to affect to confound them , in a common cause , with those miserable enemies of public freedom and safety ? Sir , if I am asked what course , in my opinion , should be pursued , in this momentous business , I can not answer without doubt and distrust in my own judgment , where I may differ from many whose opinion I highly respect ; but it is fair to say that the opinion , which I have always entertained , and always expressed , publicly and privately , on this subject , is , that this measure can not be finally and satisfactorily adjusted , unless some arrangement shall be made , with respect to the Roman Catholic clergy , and some security afforded to the state , against foreign interference . On the best consideration I have been able to give the subject , and on the fullest communication I have been enabled to obtain on it , I am satisfied that such security may be afforded , without interfering , in any degree , with the essentials of their religion ; and
