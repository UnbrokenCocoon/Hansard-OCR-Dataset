England , Ireland , and Scotland , as established by law . Some of the petitioners against the Catholics , desire the separation to be eternal ; I would secure the church and the state by identification ; they would do it by patronage—I by union . I would effect every object by bringing in a Bill , which should contain such provisions as would guard the rights of the church , and the colleges , and the corporations ; and I would leave other provisions , to be filled up by others in the committee , provided they were not filled up in such a manner as to qualify , or rather to neutralize , the liberty you were conceding , or to displace the gift you were bestowing . Such a measure I think practicable , and I know it to be desirable . This preamble I would make a covenant of concord , in which I would urge the necessity of putting an end to all animosities , national and religious . The two islands have been , for two centuries , in a state of political contest—I would put an end to it—I would have the liberty of the press unrestrained in every thing but one—the people should not abuse one another out of their allegiance . They have the French and the Dutch to quarrel with abroad , and they may quarrel with ministers at home , or if they do not like that , they may attack the opposition : But they should never wage war against each other . It is a system which you can not put an end to too soon—you are one people—you have but one interest—the outcry , which is raised among you , is neither the voice of religion , nor the voice of nature , and it can not be appeased too soon . I would therefore propose as a first step , that the House should go into a committee on the Catholic claims , agreeably 763 to the Resolution of the last parliament , and I would now read the resolution which I should bring forward in the committee as the foundation of a bill.—The right hon . gentleman then read the Resolution to the following effect , — '' That with a view to such an adjustment as may be conclusive for the peace , strength and security of the English constitution and the ultimate concord of the British empire , it is highly advisable to provide for the removal of the civil and military disqualifications , under which his Majesty 's Roman Catholic subjects at present labour , making full provision , at the same time , for the maintenance and security of the Protestant succession to the crown , according to the Act of Limitations , and for preserving inviolable the Protestant episcopal church of Great Britain and Ireland , and the church of Scotland , their doctrines , discipline , and government as by law established . '' I now move , `` That this House will resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House , to take into its most serious consideration the State of the Laws affecting his Majesty 's Roman Catholic subjects in Great Britain and Ireland , with a view to such a final and conciliatory adjustment as may be conducive to the peace and strength of the United Kingdom , to the stability of the Protestant establishment , and to the general satisfaction and concord of all classes of his Majesty 's subjects . '' addressed the House , in a maiden speech , as follows : Sir ; I rise , with great diffidence , on the present occasion , conscious of my inability to offer any thing , which may have the commendation of novelty , upon a subject so repeatedly discussed by persons the most distinguished for talents , for knowledge and for political experience : —but , forcibly impressed with the variety of considerations it involves , and the importance of the interests it affects , being no less than the rights and privileges we enjoy as Protestants , I can
