or unjust ; and that they continue to be no less indispensably requisite than heretofore , for the maintenance and security of the Church establishment , against those whose principles , when carried into effect , have ever been found incompatible with true Christian toleration , and subversive of civil and religious liberty ; and that , in stating this their humble opinion , the petitioners can not but recollect , that the safeguards of which they deprecate the removal have been proved by long experience to be necessary , that they were established by our ancestors at a period when our laws and liberties were fixed-on a solid basis , and the crown of these dominions was limited , by the Act of Settlement , to the Protestant succession ; and praying , that the House will , in its wisdom , continue to preserve those safeguards which , under Divine Providence , have been the firm support of our national constitution in Church and State , and of the title of our revered monarch , and his august family , to the throne of this United Kingdom . '' moved , That the Standing Order of this House , of the 18th day of June 1811 , `` That all Petitions for Private Bills be presented within fourteen days after the first Friday in the next and every future session of parliament , '' might be read ; and the same being read ; Resolvedâ€”1 .

He , for one , would always claim that undoubted right , and always exercise it according to his discretion . also protested against it as contrary to the usage of parliament , and as tending to cramp the proceedings of the House . rose and observed , that more time ought to be allowed for the consideration of the many important topics touched on in the Prince Regent 's Speech , and especially the three wars in which we were engaged , the policy of which he was not yet prepared to approve .
