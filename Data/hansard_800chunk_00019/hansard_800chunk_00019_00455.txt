it which you will ) is composed of materials which render it impossible that it should 920 last long , or again break out into dangerous activity , and that the opposition and discontent excited by the repeal of these odious absurd laws , will be feeble and transient , whilst the blessings it will diffuse over the whole empire will be great , general , and eternal . This dread of Catholic emancipation , which , I am ready to admit , is too prevalent , is an effect arising from causes that are becoming daily less operative , or that have already in a great measure ceased to exist . It arises , in the first place , from ignorance as to the real state of the Catholics , and the real nature of their claims , an ignorance which has already in a great measure given way to discussion , and which , it can not be doubted , a few more years will entirely dispel . In the next place , from that to which , I presume , it is no longer irregular to allude , the known opinion of the sovereign . Unfortunately there no longer exists any claim upon his subjects to spare his feelings or to comply with his wishes ; but an impulse once given with such force from the highest power in the state , continues to act long after the hand that gave it is withdrawn , and it can not be doubted that the prejudice existing against the Catholics upon other grounds , is even yet strengthened and confirmed by the authority of a sovereign , who was so long revered as the wise and faithful guardian of the religion and liberty of his people . And then , Sir , come all those ancient , traditional hereditary feelings , the offspring off times and circumstances so far different from our own , when , —as under queen Mary , whom , from the language of some persons , one would suppose to have been his Majesty 's immediate predecessor upon the throne , the Roman Catholic religion , was the religion of persecution and blood ; or when , as at a later period , though subdued at home , it was powerful and hostile abroad , the religion under whose banners were marshalled all the enemies to the English name , the engine by which France sought to impose the yoke of a despotic and stipendiary prince upon the neck of a free and rival people . These , Sir , I verily believe , far more than any sound deliberate view of the case , are the causes of public opinion so far as it is unfavourable to the Catholic Claims . But in all this I see nothing stable , nothing permanent , nothing that time , aye , nothing that a very short time , is not certain to remove ; nothing that ought to alarm the friends to the measure with the prospect of a long and dangerous resistance . 921 The very different footing upon which the question is now admitted to stand from that upon which it formerly stood , the altered tone of the enemies to emancipation afford no slight or doubtful indication of what we may expect , —some of the arguments on which they were accustomed most to rely , some of their favourite and most effectual weapons , are now laid aside , and deemed useless , even by those that once wielded them with the greatest vigour and success . What , for instance , is become of that famous argument—or , as , if it had not been deemed a famous argument I should rather call it , that miserable mischievous sophism , about the coronation oath , by which they so long perplexed the consciences of the good people of England , and by which it is said that , unfortunately for himself , and unfortunately for the country , they were enabled to secure to themselves the assistance of the illustrious person to whom that oath was administered ? Why , except
