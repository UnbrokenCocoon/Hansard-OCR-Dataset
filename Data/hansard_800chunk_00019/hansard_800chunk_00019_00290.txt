. But the noble lord has very properly said , that the 634 main question , indeed the only question for deliberation and decision to night , is whether we will uphold by our votes the justice of the cause of our country , laying aside all dispute upon the less important point of the practical management of the war . And agreeing with the noble lord in this view of our present , and most pressing duty ; agreeing that our first object must be to inform our new enemy that we , the parliament of the British empire , think our country in the right , and that we are determined to stand by the executive government in maintaining that right against any power that may venture to dispute it , and thinking at the same time that any very anxious or angry discussion as to the vigour and effect with which the cause of the country has hitherto been maintained by the executive government might , if it impaired the unanimity of this vote , detract from its weight and consideration with the government and people of the United States of America , I confess that I am glad to postpone all such details , however important they may be in other views of the subject , or however fit for separate discussion hereafter ; and I shall be much less solicitous to examine this night the conduct of administration since the war has began , than to vindicate the principles on which this and preceding administrations hare acted in the transactions from which `` he war has sprung , and to establish those upon which it must be maintained , and upon which alone it can be concluded with safety and with honour . The hon . gentleman who spoke last , observed at the outset of his speech , with regret , mingled with some consolation , that the differences with the United States were now reduced to a single point , and he recommended that the negociations should be revived with a view to an amicable conclusion on that point . I agree with the hon . gentleman that the grounds of dispute are ostensibly so much narrowed that if a negociation could be set on foot , which should have regard merely to the true interests of the republic of the United States , and should not be disturbed and diverted from its course by the influence of those passions by which its government has been agitated , then , indeed , we might hope for conciliation and tranquillity ; but I can not concur with him , either that the point in dispute is of such easy settlement ; complicated as it has been in the course of the negociations with national feelings and animosities . 635 Still less do I think that so prompt a solution of the difficulty , as he seems to reckon upon , is afforded by his construction of the English Act of Parliament to which he has referred . If indeed the true meaning and intent of the statute of Anne were to give to foreign sailors , entering and serving on board the British navy , not only all those privileges here , but all that protection against their natural sovereigns and native governments , which the United States both claim the right of conferring , and in practice attempt to confer upon British sailors seduced , or deserting , into their service , then I admit that this country would have to make to America an equal concession for an equal infringement of national rights ; and that as there would have been a parity in the infringement , there could be no difficulty in a parity of concession . Neither government could in that case have had any thing to reproach to the other : and instead of a question of violation of the law of nations on the one side , and of forcible and summary self-redress on the other , the whole matter would be one of mutual acknowledgment , as to the past , and of conventional arrangement for the
