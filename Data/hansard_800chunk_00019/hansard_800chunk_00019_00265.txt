with the United States , having justice on the side of Great Britain ? And the proposition which he meant to ground on their decision in the affirmative was , that an Address should be presented to his royal highness the Prince Regent , calling on him to direct a vigorous prosecution of the war with the United States ; and praying him to repose the fullest confidence in the support of his parliament and people . Of the negociations now before the House , he had to observe that many points had on former occasions occupied much of their attention , and given rise to discussions of no inconsiderable length . The points , therefore , to which he would more particularly draw their attention in the present instance were those which were to be found of any importance in the latter stages of the correspondence . 596 They would , he was satisfied , easily collect from them the necessity of the stand which the government was now disposed to make , and would consequently acquiesce cheerfully in the proposition with which he should conclude to call on the crown to engage with spirit in the contest , confident of finding in the people a determined resolution to repel the attacks which had been so wantonly made on them , and which they could not have prevented but by a sacrifice of rights acknowledged and maintained by every nation whose intercourse with her neighbours is regulated by any reference to a code of international law . They would ascertain that every possible attempt on our parts had been made to bring the American government to reason , and that every such attempt had failed , merely because there was to be found in that government , supported by a part of the population entrusted to their rule , an inordinate and insolent spirit of encroachment which would have made protracted forbearance appear like imbecility , and would have committed the honour of the country , the government of which could seem insensible to insult so frequently repeated . This was a spirit which had seemed to gain strength from every fresh concession , and had at length risen to a height which imperiously called for resistance from this country , if the preservation of her rights and her honour were dear to her children . We had gone perhaps as great lengths as ever nation had gone , to evince our anxiety to be on a friendly footing with a people , with whom no doubt we had the strongest incentives to remain on such terms , it was now high time to substitute the spear for the olive branch , and show the perverse enemy we had to cope with , that in our humility no principle of fear had mingled , and that we could be as terrible in the conflict they had provoked , as we had been mild in the negociation by which we had sought to avoid it . The Address which he should this night propose to the House , he trusted , would lay the foundation of such a peace as it would alone be desirable to obtain.â€”The noble lord then proceeded to take a view of the documents which had been published by the American government , contending , that an adequate notion could be collected from them of the unreasonable spirit of hostility by which that government was actuated against this country . He referred in particular to the exposition 597 of the President of the motives which had induced the declaration of war , and to the paper which had been published by the Secretary of Foreign Legations after the commencement of it . He asserted that these papers would be found to contain a full and complete disavowal of all the points on which it had been supposed in this country that concessions had been made , and amity thereby assured ; those very points were what the American government had chosen to press as affording just grounds for hostility , arguing on them in precisely the opposite direction to what any reasonable man would have supposed
