looked to principally as a naval one by the other nations of Europe . But still he contended , it would be to let down and to undervalue the victory of Salamanca , if it were to be brought before the House unconnected with other considerations , and not as it stood , connected on the grand scale of the military operations of which it formed so pre-eminent a part . This was not a victory which had been thrown in the way of lord Wellington , which he had been able to accomplish , and gloriously accomplish , on the instant ; but it was a transaction which wound up a military object , the result of long preparation and of foresight , in which the application of just principles was so interwoven with various circumstances , that he should fail in his duty to the army , and to the marquis of Wellington , if he were not shortly and generally to describe the causes which had led to the Victory of Salamanca , and its consequent advantages . The House would recollect , that at the close of the former , and at the commencement of the present campaign , lord Wellington , after dispossessing Massena of Portugal , had made himself master of Almeida , but Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz were still in the hands of the enemy . Both armies had retired into winter quarters , and remained for some time in inactivity on account of the season ; but such vigorous preparations for renewing hostilities were made by the marquis of Wellington so early as January , ( a period at which , even in that clime , armies have seldom been occupied in preparing to take the field ) that in that month he was enabled to lay siege to Ciudad Rodrigo . Nothing higher to the praise of the marquis of Wellington could be said , than that he had completed his preparations for this operation with such activity and secrecy , 152 that he was enabled to reduce this fortress ( which was one of a most respectable decription ) before marshal Marmont was able to call his troops from their winter cantonments , and advance further than Salamanca . Lord Wellington having got possession of Ciudad Rodrigo , meditated an advance on Badajoz , and his arrangements consequent on this design were made with so much expedition and secrecy , that marshal Marmont believed the English army to be still at Ciudad Rodrigo , when seven of eight divisions had arrived at Badajoz . He attacked this fortress , which was stronger and of more importance than that of Ciudad Rodrigo , early in the month of March , and carried on the works with such vigour and alacrity , that the French armies of the north and of Portugal , under Soult and Marmont , were unable to relieve it , and it was even confessed by Soult , an officer of great ability , in explaining to the war minister of France the causes of the loss of Badajozâ€”it was admitted in his dispatches to Berthier , which were intercepted , that lord Wellington had taken Badajoz in the face of two armies , each of which in strength was equal to his own . It was stated by Soult that the army under lord Wellington was not superior to that under his command , nor to that commanded by Marmont ; but he stated the difficulty of assembling troops to be so great , and the rapidity of lord Wellington 's movements to be so extraordinary ( an admission most honourable to the gallant marquis , more particularly as it came from an enemy ) , his operations carried on with such celerity , the siege pressed with such vigour , and the assault made with such gallantry , as to exceed all his calculations : so that he had only reached Albuera with his army , on his way to relieve the fortress , when he received intelligence that it had fallen . These services then , it would be seen , lord Wellington had accomplished
