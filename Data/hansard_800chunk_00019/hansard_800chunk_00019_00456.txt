in a few obscure pamphlets , and low inflammatory hand-bills , we have for a long time past heard nothing of its existence ; from the debates of this House , and from the writings and discourse of all reasonable men , it has utterly disappeared . A sense of shame too appears to have deterred men from any longer asserting , that the Roman Catholic religion , the religion of some of the wisest and most pious persons that ever adorned the human race , the religion of allies , whom we trust , and of forefathers whom we revere ; the religion of some of the greatest and most respected communities , the religion which by its extent and its duration must characterize Christianity to the rest of the world , the religion of those between whom and every privilege they most eagerly and every object they most ardently desire , we have never sought to interpose any obstacle but their own inviolable regard to honour and to duty , that this religion renders its followers incapable of observing that common faith which binds us together in society . A sense of shame , I say , has deterred men from doctrines like these , and they are content to rely upon arguments , which , though when examined they may be found equally inconclusive , are at least not quite so repugnant to good feeling , to reason , and to experience . In the mean time toleration advances , with sure and rapid steps ; every discussion adds new , or confirms the old arguments in its favour , and every day adds converts to a cause which never loses a proselyte it has once gained . 922 With all these symptoms of a declining cause I would ask gentlemen , whom I must presume to be actuated not by a blind bigoted hostility to a sect or a measure , but by deliberate assignable motives of religion and state policy , why persevere ? I can very well understand how in their view of the case it would be desirable to retain the restrictive code , but how to retain it ? Not as a thing to be fought for from day to day under a certainty of its final destruction , but as that which I presume , no man now so much as flatters himself that it can ever become a permanent and enduring system of legislation . Or do they think they shall render good service to the state , and advance the interests of the Protestant faith , if at the price of continuing the agitation of the public mind here , and of exasperating the Catholics of Irelandâ€”that is to say Ireland itself , they contrive to purchase a short respite from an inevitable sentence ? Do they flatter themselves that they shall promote the happiness of the empire and the cause of true religion , if by again urging all those topics that are most calculated to excite jealousy and irritation , if by exaggerating any errors of which the Catholics may have been guilty in the conduct of a cause so delicate and so trying to their feelings , they are enabled to re-animate the expiring prejudices of the country , and to delay the measure till it shall have lost every thing that it yet retains of grace , favour and conciliation , perhaps to some period of public difficulty and danger , when it would no longer be , as it would even now , a just subject of exultation and joy , but of terror as to its cause ; and of doubt as to its result ? Or are the blessings that have already arisen from excluding the Catholics from that career of honour and emolument which is open to their fellow subjects , so great and palpable ; is the restrictive code so good a thing in itself ; does it so recruit our armies , does it so augment our revenues , does it so recommend us to our Roman Catholic allies ; does it so secure us against all chance of
