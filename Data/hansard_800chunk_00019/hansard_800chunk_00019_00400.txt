in church or state ; since the laws which first excluded , and now exclude , them from office and parliament , viz . the 25th and 30th Car . 2 , were enacted nearly a century and a half after the Reformation , from which our ecclesiastical onstitution takes its date ; and some years before the Revolution , when our civil constitution was perfected ; and since the partial repeal of many of these laws , in the acts of 18th and 31st of the King , shews that the legislature has never seen any thing so sacred and fundamental in their character , as to prevent their removal , when the necessity , which originally directed their enactment , appeared no longer to require their continuance . As the 'res dura et regni novitas , ' which was the justification of our ancestors , does not apply to the present times , so neither are the principles , on which these laws are now defended , the same as those on which they were grounded . The principle of toleration , much to the credit of the present times , is now almost universally admitted , in its application to the Catholics ; who were however excluded from its benefits by some of the wisest and most liberal of our ancestors in former times ; in proof of which Mr. Locke 's sentiments and those of bishop Burnet , where he assigns his reasons for voting for the 11th and 12th of Will . 3 , are remarkable . The question which has arisen in the debate of this night , whether Roman Catholics could claim the removal of their political disabilities as a right , is a petitio principii on both sides , since it depends on the main question , whether the safety of the state requires their continuance . The admission of a small number of Roman Catholics into the Houses of Parliament , does not appear more likely to be prejudicial to our establishments , than the admission of a small number of Presbyterians at present . The doctrine , that a sovereign can not be faithfully or effectually served , except by persons professing the same religion with himself , is contradicted by history , ( in proof of which it might be sufficient to produce the example of Sully the Protestant minister of Henry 4 , and of count Witgenstein , the triumphant Catholic general of an heretic master against his Catholic enemies ; ) and has no foundation in our constitution ; because the reasons , for 836 which our constitution declares the crown to be essentially Protestant , do not apply to the ministers of the crown ; since the king is the head of the established church , and must therefore profess the established religion ; or else this absurdity would follow , that the head might have one faith and the members another ; and , because in point of expediency , there is no comparison between the two cases , since the laws provide an easy remedy against the malpractices of a responsible minister , but none against those of an irresponsible sovereign . The apprehension of danger , from the recognition of the Pope 's spiritual supremacy by Roman Catholics , does not seem to consist solely in their denial of the King 's , which is common to them with the Presbyterians , nor solely in their acknowledgment of a foreign jurisdiction , which is the case also of the Moravians , but arises out of that sort of prejudice , which may be entertained by men of the most upright intentions and the greatest learning , who are more intimately conversant with the controversies and history of remote ages , than with the state of Europe at present , and the events of the last century , during which there is perhaps no instance to be found of this authority of the Pope having seduced a single Catholic from his loyalty and allegiance to his temporal prince ; the gratuitous assumption of inadmissible demands , to be made hereafter , by the Catholics
