the division of labour made the labourer more inexpert . But would not the advisers of the crown advise the appointment of the fittest person for the office ? It had been said , that the separation of the bankruptcy causes would not afford a sufficient relief to the Lord Chancellor . Did not the bankruptcy causes constitute one-fourth of the Chancery business ? The Chancellor who should be left with three-fourths of the present business , and should be unable to execute it , was very unfit to hold that situation . An hon . and learned gentleman ( Mr. Stephen ) , had been at once the accuser and exculpator of the Master of the Rolls . He knew not why that hon . and learned gentleman had thought fit to become the accuser of that exalted character , or whether it was by his permission that he had become his defender . Did the hon . and learned gentleman think that it was a fortunate defence for the Master of the Rolls , that he had withdrawn himself from the decision of causes at the Cockpit , because an opponent of his , at a county election , had received some support from ministers ? He thought the hon . and learned gentleman ought to consider some time before he appeared again in the character of a defender . He could see no objection to the separation of bankruptcy causes from the great seal . The taking away part of the Chancellor 's emoluments was no objection , for the Chancellor ought to be liberally paid , and consequently compensated for 690 any loss .

These Petitions were read , and ordered to lie on the table . presented a Petition from the inhabitants of the ward of Billingsgate , against the Roman Catholic Claims . moved that the 691 whole of this Petition be read.â€”The Petition was accordingly read by the clerk . asked if the noble duke intended any objection to the Petition . answered , that it was not with any intent to object to this Petition being received , but amongst the number of Petitions which had come before them on this subject , there was great difference in the language of the petitioners , and he must confess the name of the place from whence this came had caught his ear , and it made him desirous of hearing the whole of it .
