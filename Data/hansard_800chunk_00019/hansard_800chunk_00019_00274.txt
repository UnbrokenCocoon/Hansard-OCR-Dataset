negociation , his Majesty 's government gave the necessary orders to the various officers , and took measures to reinforce the army and navy in America , as far as was consistent with other services . If some might think , that subsequently a due degree of active hostility had not been exhibited , he should be ready , in all humility , to give his reasons for thinking the imputation unfounded , and for preferring the employment of our forces on certain , rather than on contingent objects . Persevering in the principle of conciliating rather than in irritating 610 the Americans , government adopted a defensive rather than an offensive warfare towards them . Without withdrawing any of our force from the peninsula , we had been able successfully to defend Canada , and to prevent any one of our valuable fleets from falling a victim to the sudden eruption of a war , the moment of the declaration of which was chosen by the enemy . If it were contended that the blockade of the American ports was not sufficiently early , he would reply , that it was not deemed an advisable policy to institute that blockade immediately after the declaration of war ; first , because that would have been to punish our allies , who were obtaining their requisite supplies by those outlets ; secondly , because there were many American merchants who had purchased goods in this country on the faith of their being allowed to import them into the United States . In contemplating the whole course of conduct adopted by government in this affair , he trusted he should not be accused of arrogance for declaring that he saw nothing of which he repented , or which he wished retracted . While they had manifested an anxious desire on all occasions to modify their measures in such a way as should be least offensive to neutral powers , he defied any one to lay his finger on any part of their conduct , by which they had sacrificed the rights and interests of the country . If they had been unable to avoid war , they had at least given the country a good cause of war , and had sacredly guarded all her privileges . For America , he confessed that he deeply lamented the injury which her character had sustained by the conduct of her government ; it was conduct unworthy of any state calling itself civilized and free . The hostility of America towards the powers of Europe who were struggling to repress the ambition of France , had precipitated her from the eminence on which she had heretofore stood ; and if any thing could lower her still more in the cool judgment of every reflecting mind , it was the moment which she had selected to throw her weight into the scale of French influenceâ€”it was on the eve of receiving , through the communication of the British government , that most offensive paper of the duke of Bassano 's , which menaced every country that would not acquiesce in the designs of France . As far as Great Britain was concerned , it seemed as if America was impatient to get into 611 the war ; otherwise , after waiting so long , she would assuredly have waited the result of the deliberations of that House , certainly sanctioned by a great portion of the community , on the expediency of persevering in the Orders in Council . It was no answer to say that it was in vain to wait for sentiments which had already been often and distinctly expressed ; for although the British government might have still maintained the right in which the Orders in Council were founded , the question of commercial expediency might induce a different practice , reserving the right . The American government therefore had no reason to suppose that the agitation of the subject would not end in the revocation of the Orders ; but if there was nothing else to be considered , let the House consider the situation of the rest of Europe at the
