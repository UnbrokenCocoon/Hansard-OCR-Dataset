naval officer at the Cape of Good Hope , so far as they respect the carrying on of the Slave Trade in that settlement , or in any of the neighbouring islands. '' —Ordered . said , that in calling the attention of the House to the Message which his Royal Highness had been graciously pleased to lay before them , he might , he believed , feel and express a confidence that , at least upon the principle of the Message , there could exist but little , if any variety of opinion . There was , he was convinced , no person who then heard him , that could feel any unwillingness to repay the services of so gallant and so distinguished an officer as the marquis of Wellington , with every title of honour that the crown could confer , and every pecuniary reward the country could afford to bestow . Whatever difficulty there might exist in the calculation of what was due to his services , and what was due to the nation ; whatever might be the limits they would feel it necessary to impose upon the principle of the Message , and the generosity that dictated it , upon the claims of 202 the gallant general , upon his signal services , upon his high merits and great achievements , there could exist no difference of opinion . The House should recollect , that the honours which had been hitherto conferred on lord Wellington by his sovereign , were not sought for by him ; that such honours were not conferred merely for the gratification of the individual , to be worn by him as memorials of his military greatness , and testimonies of his sovereign 's regard , they were conferred as an example to others—that they might feel those motives to noble exertion , to gallant service , and military fame , which could not fail to hold out a generous excitement to every person that had the happiness to live under our free and happy constitution . Honours of such a nature should be always conferred less with a view to the individual than to their general effects ; but the House must also feel , that in conferring such honours , there was at least an implied engagement that they should be neither burthensome nor painful to the person who received them , but conferred in such a way as to make them worthy both of the crown and of the people . The honours with which the marquis of Wellington had been graced , were not merely bestowed by the crown , but were called for by the voice of the nation . And he might say with truth , that the sanction and approbation of that House had followed so closely upon the gift of the sovereign , that the honours of the brave general were not less under the sanction of parliament than of the crown . By such conduct they had , at least , marked the extent of his claims . Lord Wellington , though yet a young man , though much he hoped of his valuable life would be yet spent in the service of his country ; however , young as he was , he had received more testimonies of his sovereign 's favour than any subject who lived before his time , not excepting even the great duke of Marlborough . It was the singular fortune of that distinguished officer , that in addition to the rewards and honours bestowed by his sovereign , he had received upon six different occasions what was not less flattering or less honourable , the thanks of that House : —on lord Wellington , who was younger in years but not in experience , the thanks of that House had been conferred not less than eight times , six of which had been for his services on the peninsula , where he was opposed , not as he had been before to an Indian enemy , but to armies long accus- 203 tomed to victory , to armies commanded by men of the first military talents
