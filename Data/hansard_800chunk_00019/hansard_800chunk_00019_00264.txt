be the result of the most patient and cautious deliberation , he would cheerfully supply , by unreserved answers to any interrogatories that might be put to him , such information as might tend to elucidate the documents on the table , and render the result of inquiry as full and mature , as it would be beneficial to the community . The chief point to which the attention of the House would be directed was , whether it had been in the power of ministers , by any exertion , to have prevented the much-to-be-deprecated war in which we were now engaged ; and here he hoped to have credit from the House , when he said , that no one more sincerely lamented the necessity of that war than he did . War , in its most favourable aspect calamitous to a country , was , in this instance , rendered by peculiar circumstances doubly calamitous . Most sincerely grieved was he that he could but too well make out for the satisfaction of the House the necessity there was for extending that evil ; for exchanging , in our relations with the United States , that peaceful intercourse , which was so beneficial to both nations , for all the ills which a state of hostility involves ; and he trusted , that in the sentiment by which he was actuated , his colleagues , the parliament , and the nation at large , most cordially participated . That justice was obviously on our side , was , indeed , a mighty consolation , but certainly not all-efficient to subdue the sense of the calamity in which the severe pressure of necessity had involved us . But was a feeling of this nature to lay us at the feet of an enemy who had met every act of conciliation on our part with augmented hostility ? He trusted that we would be found actuated by a far different spirit , and that , after having deplored the infatuation in the government and population of the United States which had forcibly drawn us into the contest , we should turn our attention to every means by which unjust aggression could be most effectually repelled . In the course of 595 what he should have to submit to the House , and from the documents before them , it would appear very plainly that ministers had not wantonly plunged the country into a war which there were so many motives if possible to avoid ; and in having at length recourse to it that they were compelled to the step after they had by repeated attempts to promote a pacific temper in the enemy , endeavoured to avert the evil . They felt confident that they had carried into it with them the feelings of the country with so full a tide , that it would be prosecuted with a vigour and firmness of spirit such as would be most likely to promote the only legitimate end and object of all warâ€”a secure and honourable peace . Nor , indeed , was it to be despaired that a wise and firm line of policy on our part , together with a candid and temperate discussion of the differences which had arisen between the two nations , might have a more extended effect than that of confirming our own people in a resolution to maintain their rights unimpaired . It was difficult to suppose the people of America so deaf to the voice of reason as to be utterly unconscious that in the intercourse which had taken place between the governments of the two countries their 's had not been the party which had held justice cheapest , and sought the most eagerly for war ; and if their eyes were once opened to this fact , it would not be an unreasonable expectation if we looked to their calling on their rulers to desist from hostilities , in which they were likely to reap neither honour nor profit . The question now before the House was simply this , whether the country was or was not engaged in war
