it was not so , it was not such an appeal , it was an inflamed statement of all the topics of grievance that could be raked together with a view of effecting the object of her Royal Highness 's advisers . There were no additional restrictions imposed at this period that could have warranted this letter . The Princess Charlotte was still as before permitted to see her mother once a week , when she was in town ; but when she was removed to Windsor , it was found inconvenient , and injurious to her education , that a journey to London should occupy three days out of every six ; it was therefore determined , that her Royal Highness , during the period of her residence at Windsor , should visit London and her royal mother but once a fortnight ; but it never , that the noble lord had heard , was intended to continue this restriction beyond the residence at Windsor , and when the Princess Charlotte should have returned to town , all would have gone on as before . Was this , he would ask , a restriction of such injury and oppression as to call for this accusatory letter ? This was the whale of what had been magnified into a great infliction of punishment and inference 1150 of guilt , and he was sure the House would see it as he did , to be a matter in no ways sufficient to justify the Letter of her Royal Highness . In respect to the conduct of the Prince , he did all that lay in his power to secure sound advice . He called in all the heads of the law , and the church , to advise merely to one point , what restraints should be placed on the intercourse between the Princess and her daughter . There never was a stronger imputation cast on any one than was cast on the Prince by the legal advisers of the letter of the Princessâ€”it was an appeal to the country against their prince , and an appeal to the child against her parent . But of all the paragraphs of `` he Letter , that which related to the canting paragraph about the confirmation , was the most reprehensible ; for if her Royal Highness had ever spoken to the bishop of Salisbury , the tutor of the Princess , on the subject , with a wish on her part to have the ceremony performed , he could have told her that it was his Majesty 's express wish it should not take place till the Princess had attained her I8th year . The country , he was sure , would feel that the Prince had discharged his duty ; and that his consultation with the council on the education of his child was a proof of his love of his people , and that he had shewn an anxious desire to exercise the prerogative of educating his daughter , with a just sense of its great importance . It was not by any means just to infer that any criminality was imputed to the Princess , for the separation alone was sufficient to justify the restraints , and they ought to be considered merely as matter of regulation arising out of the unfortunate circumstance of the separation . He would maintain that the hon . member had not laid any parliamentary grounds for his Amendment , not having shewn what course of proceedings he would adopt , if the Report was laid on the table , and therefore he should oppose his motion . being alluded to personally , felt himself called on to make a few observations : he did not know whether he was called on to defend himself against a charge for having been an adviser of the Princess , or for having given his advice , or for not being any longer her adviser . As to the first point , he had to say , that he was commanded , in 1806 , to attend her Royal Highness at Blackheath , to assist in defending
