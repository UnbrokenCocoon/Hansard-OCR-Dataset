ever it is wielded as an engine of political power , or made subservient to political purposes . This religion , differing from all others which ever this earth knew , from its dawn affected political power ; and as it grew in strength , divided the allegiance of the subjects of all states , between their legitimate sovereign and the head of the Romish church . It gained great temporal possessions , and at last assumed a title to the whole earth . Kings received their kingdoms from the Pope , and did homage for their lands ; even the British hon couched beneath the holy pastor 's crook , and , humbled and tamed by the spell of his influence , received from the Pontiff 's hands the crown of England and the chains of Rome—chains which the Reformation burst in England , but which the unfortunate people of Ireland suffered with impatience to a later day . The Reformation in England had alarmed the see of Rome ; and to defeat , as far as possible , 865 that great effort of the English nation , Ireland was ever since made the theatre for Popish influence to gall and distress the heretical and apostate power of Great Britain . This , and the circumstance of conquest , which I have already mentioned , I take to be the real causes for the feelings of the Roman Catholics of Ireland continuing , to this day , more jealous and more difficult to be altered in that country , than in any other country on earth . I have thus , Sir , endeavoured to draw your attention to the state of things as they really are , that the dangers on both sides may be fairly estimated . I do not say they may not be remedied—God forbid I should have so gloomy a view of the subject . But I see and feel more difficulty than many honourable members seem to suspect , and most of all I feel , at this moment , the unbending disposition of the Catholic body ; so far from yielding in any particulars , that they actually retract former concessions , and now refuse to admit what , to my knowledge , they were willing , three years ago , to accept With gratitude , and did , therefore , actually publish their thanks to some Protestant bodies who took into consideration the Veto , and were , willing to take it as the security they looked for , against foreign influence . I do not , however , despair , nor do I wish to direct on that body at large the violence , intemperance , and hostile menaces of those who somehow have assumed the conduct of their cause , and in parliamentary parade and state have assumed the political government of the Catholics of Ireland . I therefore am ready to go directly into the consideration of any defined proposal for their relief ; and this mode I would prefer to a committee of the whole House , as proposed by the highly respectable character who introduced the question—a character whom every Irishman regards , and every Englishman must admire—whose zeal and unwearied industry , in the service of his native country , we must all acknowledge with gratitude , But when even he , after twelve years attention to this subject , has been unable to produce any specific plan , any tangible proposition , I feel that our researches will be vain in a committee into which we enter without a direct object , and it will turn out , like the proceedings of the debating societies , I have before alluded to—all declamation en grievances either real or imaginary , in- 866 flaming passions and baffling reasons ; raising difficulties and not applying remedies . I therefore , on the whole , prefer the mode pointed out by my learned friend , to introduce a Bill at once stating the points in which it might be prudent to yield , and staling the securities which they offer for the preservation of our ancient and glorious
