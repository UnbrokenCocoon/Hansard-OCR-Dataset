deputy , and for providing other means for recompensing the faithful discharge of high or effective civil offices , and for other economical purposes . '' disclaimed any intention of opposing the motion of his hon . friend , or of entering into the discussion of its merits on the present occasion . But , 508 in a future stage of the proceeding he should state fully the grounds upon which he felt it his duty to oppose his right hon . friend 's proposition in the last parliament , and upon which he still felt himself bound to maintain the same opinion . He could not , however , let this opportunity pass by without stating his conviction , that the principle of reform pursued by his hon . friend on this subject was perfectly novel , and by no means in accordance with the principles acted upon in the regulation of public offices in former instances , cither by Mr. Burke or by his late right hon . friend , Mr. Pitt . This he should be prepared to show at the proper time . But there was one remarkable feature belonging to this measure , which he never could overlook , and which indeed must impress the mind of any man by whom it was fully considered , namely , that his hon . friend was not able to shew that his proposition would , in a pecuniary view , be productive of any saving to the public , while in a constitutional view it directly tended to trench upon the royal prerogative , and involved a very exceptionable innovation upon old established practice . , in proposing the committal of the Local Tokens Bill , observed , that the period to which he proposed to extend the power for allowing the circulation of Local Tokens , he was induced , upon farther consideration , to abandon . That period was the 1st of October , but he now meant to fix upon the 5th of July , because parliament might in that case make farther arrangements , should an adequate supply of Bank Tokens happen not to be forthcoming , which appeared by no means probable . Indeed , he had every reason to expect that the Local Tokens might , without any public inconvenience , be wholly dispensed with , at even an earlier period than the 5th of July ; such was the improved prospect of the currency . As to the animadversions upon his right hon . friend the Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer , in consequence of his allusion to the probable necessity of a different measure upon the subject for Ireland , he thought it necessary to say a few words . It was but candour in his right hon . friend to express the inclination of his mind , in order that , if the measure he at the time of the expression contemplated , should really become necessary , no member 509 might be taken by surprise . For himself , he hoped and trusted that necessity would not call for any difference between the two countries , however differently circumstanced upon this subject . At all events , nothing practicable should be left undone to avoid such a necessity . Indeed , as far as he had the power of influencing the circulating medium , he had always been most studious to provide for the accommodation of Ireland , and he should ever continue to be so . In pursuance of this solicitude , which he felt in common with his colleagues , it was intended to send a large proportion of bullion to Ireland , sufficient , he hoped , for its wants ; yet , if the supply should prove inadequate , his right hon . friend reserved the right of providing for the evil . observed , that ministers seemed to think it necessary to hold an undefined proposition over Ireland , while there could be no doubt of its wants as to circulating medium , and while no assurance was given that a sufficient quantity of bullion would be provided by government for the
