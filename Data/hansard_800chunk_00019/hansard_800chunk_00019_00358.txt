who , too well aware of their unbounded authority over the feelings of the people , employ it for the worst of purposes ; who exasperate enmities , when they might heal dissentions ; who encourage disaffection , when they might enforce obedience ; and who studiously kindle into a flame every latent spark of discontent , which they might extinguish , and lull the minds of the people into tranquil submission . Even if there were no dangers to be apprehended from these concessions , still I should feel it my duty to oppose this measure , because I think that the state , which has established a national religion , is imperatively called upon to encourage that religion ; because I think that the legislature ought not to preserve a neutrality between a religion , which it supports , and a religion which it only tolerates ; because . I think it ought not to manifest an indifference and deal out its favours indiscriminately to those whose principles it approves , and these whose principles it condemns ; but that it is bound , in gratitude and duty , to repose a superior confidence and evince a decided preference towards those whose steady attachment preserves its stability and insures its permanence . Much has been said about the power and numbers of the Roman Catholics , as inducements to comply with their pretensions ; into this part of the subject I will not enter at all . I will not examine whether their numbers have not been exaggerated and their power magnified ; I will only ask whether those , who are averse to the measure , are not decidedly more numerous ? I will only ask , whether they are not infinitely more powerful ? The Protestants of the empire are not indifferent to this great question , but they look with confidence to the decision of this House , appointed as we are by them , the legal guardians of their constitutional rights : they look with confidence to the solemn pledge afforded by the coronation oath , altered and remodelled as it was at the time of the Revolution , for the express purpose of checking the encroachments and curbing the power of Popery : grateful and contented with the blessings they enjoy , they dread such innovation in the constitution ; a constitution , the glory of this country , the envy of the world ; a constitution , which has enabled us successfully to resist external violence and domestic treason . 774 That this constitution has been preserved under the present existing religious tests , can not be denied ; and , let it be ever remembered , that it has not only been preserved , but preserved under trials the most likely to shake and overthrow any established form of government . While , in the last twenty years , almost every constitution in Europe has been convulsed and overthrown , the constitution of England , under a Protestant government , has remained unshaken and unimpaired . The glory of England , entrusted to Protestant commanders ; the power of England , under Protestant ministers , have attained that proud pre-eminence , which is , at once , our happiness and our boast . If then we are enabled , under existing laws , thus to employ our resources and to call forth our energies , let us pause before we confide those resources and those energies to persons , in whom our ancestors , the founders of this constitution , had found , from experience , they could not safely be vested . Let us pause before we consent to place power in the hands of those who have an interest rather in betraying , than in faithfully watching over their sacred trust . But , Sir , though I think that the securities for the preservation of our constitution , provided by statesmen whose principles and whose wisdom are the theme of universal applause and unqualified praise , securities sanctioned and endeared to us by a long and happy experience , are entitled to our highest respect , and our
