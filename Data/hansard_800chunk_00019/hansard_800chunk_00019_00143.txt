was sure , on the contrary , that the whole country , as well as himself , had understood it as giving to the Germans in our service permanent rank in the British 260 army . People were apt to be swayed by the obvious meaning of terms , and were not certainly bound to know that in the phraseology of the War-office , 'permanent ' meant 'temporary . ' This it appeared was the real meaning . He should however like to know if the noble lord , in consequence of his eminent services , had been promised a permanent possession of his office , how he would feel when , at the conclusion of a peace , or perhaps twelve months afterwards , he should be told that permanent meant only temporary , and be accordingly desired to resign his situation.—The very natural misconception arising out of the wording of the Order , led the nation at large to believe , that German officers were to have permanent rank with British officers in the British army . But as he now understood , from the noble Secretary at War , that those officers were only to rise gradually in their corps , according to their seniority , all he could say was , that if this was intended as a recompence for the services of the German Legion , and if they had received it as such , they were certainly the most disinterested soldiers in the world , and the cheapest to be rewarded . At the same time , he thought that the word permanent was not the most accurate expression which could be used in this country in speaking of military concerns ; it could not strictly apply to any of our military establishments , and he thanked God that the British army itself was not permanent , but would be disbanded , in fact , unless kept together from year to year by the renewal of the Mutiny Bill.—When he first heard of permanent rank being granted to the German officers , he thought that there had been something peculiar in the constitution of the German Legion , which made that order peremptory on government , and he had heard with equal surprise and satisfaction , by the noble lord 's explanation , that there was no intention of giving those foreign officers command in our army longer than the period under which they had been engaged by the sanction of parliament ; if so , there was nothing in the Order hostile to the constitution , and he saw no objection to the measure . As to the censure passed generally by the noble lord on those who entertained sentiments adverse to the Germans in our service , he begged leave not to be included in that number.—He felt the value of their services as much as any man ; he felt that generals , officers , and 261 men , had fully done their duty ; and he was above entertaining vulgar prejudices against foreigners , especially when fighting in the same cause.—Still it was natural in a free country to look with jealousy to foreign troops . As the case stood , and considering the state of Europe , he saw no danger in the power vested in the crown to employ foreign troops ; but if , as every one had supposed , the words of the Order implied the meaning they seemed to convey , if the crown had over-stepped the bounds set to its power , in that respect he thought that no measure could be more deserving of parliamentary censure . As it had been explained by the noble lord , it was a most harmless , unintelligible measure ; but if it was acceptable to the German Legion , it was , he would repeat , a cheap way of rewarding their services . in consequence of the philippic which the noble Secretary at War had uttered against those who favoured the motion , thought it necessary to guard himself against the imputation of cherishing any undue prejudices against the German Legion , or of being
