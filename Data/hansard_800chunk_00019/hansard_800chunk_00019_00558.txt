a considerable length of discussion ; but whatever 1079 differences of opinion may hereafter arise upon the important subject to which I wish to direct its attention , I flatter myself that the course of proceeding which it is my intention to suggest , will meet with general concurrence . It is not my intention this evening to call for the decision of the Committee upon any question which I may propose , but having explained my general view of the subject as clearly as may be able , to recommend that the further discussion should be adjourned to a future day , when the House may come to a decision with further information and more mature judgment . On another point I equally anticipate the general approbation of the Committee , namely , in bringing under consideration the intended measures of Finance , before any of the pecuniary arrangements of the year are concluded , in order that all parties who may enter into any agreements with the government may form their bargains with a full knowledge of all the circumstances of the case , and that the scrupulous good faith and plain dealing in Pecuniary transactions which has been so long the honour of this country may be strictly observed . Towards the close of the last session of parliament , a discussion took place upon the national finances , in which it appeared to be the general sentiment that some new measures were necessary , and in which I took the liberty to suggest several for the consideration of those gentlemen who were present . They were principally designed to support public credit , and relieve that depression which then appeared to weigh down our financial exertions ; but since that time a great change has taken place . Six months have elapsed , the most eventful and extraordinary which the history of Europe has , perhaps , ever recorded ; and which have placed our public credit and our national security on a basis of solidity which it might then have been deemed presumptuous to have contemplated . At that time , the issue of the important contest which was opening in the north of Europe was , to say the least , hazardous and doubtful . A general impression , indeed , rather prevailed , that either by arms or negociation , France would prevail against Russia , and would achieve what still was wanting for the subjugation of the continent of Europe . It is impossible to contemplate the events which followed without a mixture of admiration and horror ; of admiration for the 1080 heroic virtues which have been displayed , and of horror for the extent of human misery which has been endured ; in which I can by no means forget the miserable , though merited , and necessary destruction of so many myriads of the invading army . But from this struggle between insatiable , unprincipled , and remorseless ambition on the one side , and hardy , stubborn , though untutored , patriotism on the other , which has spread devastation over the extensive regions of the north , have followed consequences the most important , and hopes the most satisfactory to the cause of suffering humanity . It may be recollected that at the time to which I am alluding , though our discussion in a great degree turned upon the means of supporting Public Credit , and I pointed out some of those measures which , in case of extreme emergency , might be resorted to , and in which I expressed my confidence that the spirit and firmness of the nation would , in such a case , readily acquiesce ; yet I stated my opinion , that there existed no immediate necessity for their adoption , and undoubtedly the necessity of resorting to measures of great severity is much lessened by the events which have since occurred . The measures which I then particularly pointed out , as likely to be proposed in the present session , were the adoption of some more efficacious plan for the Redemption of the Land Tax , and the
