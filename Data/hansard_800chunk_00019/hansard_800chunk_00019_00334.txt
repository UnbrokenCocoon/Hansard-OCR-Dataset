, he must say , that those persons connected with the government , who wished well to their cause , were almost compelled to 734 speak unfavourably of that which they were desirous of supporting , when they heard such language as was made use of by some of the advocates of the Catholic claims . Had the right hon . baronet been present on a former day , he would have heard his hon . friend ( Mr. Peel ) manfully and candidly disclaim , on the part of the Irish government , any knowledge of the publication which had been so often referred to ; he would have heard him say , that a printer was prosecuted , not for publishing the two first parts of The Statement , but because he had promulgated that which accused the lord lieutenant of Ireland of the foul crime of murder . The publication itself appeared to him to be so clumsy a production , that it could impose upon no person ; even as an ironical attempt , it was ridiculous . He was convinced that those who were accused of being privy to it , were innocent of any such knowledge ; and he declared , that he would not belong to a government that could be guilty of such a practice . repeated the observations he had made on a former evening , as to the correctness of the statements contained in the two first parts of The Statement . He believed the secretary for Ireland was ignorant of the publication of the Third Part ; but when it appeared in a paper , under the protection of the Irish government , he did not think it could have passed unnoticed by them . defended the Irish government from any knowledge of the publication .
