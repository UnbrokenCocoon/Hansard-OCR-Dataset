assent , namely , to the affording every possible support to the executive government in the great contest in which we are engaged . It goes no farther than to rejoice at the fortunate , and to lament the unfortunate , occurrences of the last six months ; to promise every aid that may be necessary to improve the former , to repair the latter , and to bring the whole to a happy issue . In these pledges , Sir , I trust that every man who hears me , and I am confident that an incalculable majority of the country at large are prepared , without hesitation , to concur . But , if the Address proposed by the noble lord , however unexceptionable in its general tenour , had been allowed to pass without comment or observation , it might possibly be inferred that every man who had concurred in it was bound to approve the details of every measure referred to in it , and that all enquiry was precluded by this unanimous and approving vote , on points which might hereafter appear to require further illustration . It is merely to guard myself against such a sweeping conclusion , that I presume , Sir , at the present moment , to detain you and the House for a short time , while I explain my sentiments on several of the topics comprehended in the noble lord 's Address . Sir , the general view of our situation naturally divides itself into domestic and foreign ; and the foreign portion of that view into the contemplation of three distinct wars , in which we are principals or accessaries.—The first is the war in the north of Europe , which we are cheering with our encouragement , animating with our applause , and following in its progress from day to day with our fondest hope '' and most lively anxieties ; but with respect to which our situation is that of deeply interested spectators rather than of active partisans . The second is the war 63 in the peninsula , carried on principally from our own resources , aided however in some degree by those of the allies whose cause is immediately concerned ; and upon the measure of whose co-operation , therefore , our success must in the same degree depend . The third is the war with the United States of America , in which we are engaged alone , and in the conduct of which , therefore , our government is exclusively responsible . With respect , Sir , to the war in the north of Europe , it was well said by the noble lord who moved the Address , that it is the child of that great effort in the peninsula , which has enabled Europe to reflect on its condition , and has roused it to a struggle for emancipation . There can be but one feeling—that of unbounded admiration—at the great efforts which Russia has made ; Noble indeed has been the struggle , and glorious beyond anticipation the results in that quarter ; —there—even there , where the tyrant of the world doubtlessly anticipated an easy victory , and concluded , from former experience , that one decisive battle would be the precursor of an abject peace—there , where thinking that he knew his man , and that he should have only one man to cope with , and to cajole , he found what he had forgotten to take into his estimate , a nation ; —where imagining that , having issued a bulletin and taken a fort , his work was done , he unexpectedly found a countless population thronging to the standard of their sovereign , prepared for exertions and for sacrifices such as the world has seldom , if ever , witnessed before ; and opposing not merely with the arms of a disciplined soldiery , not merely with the physical mass of impenetrable multitudes , but with famine and with fire , with the voluntary destruction of their own resources , and with the conflagration of their own homes , the progress of his
