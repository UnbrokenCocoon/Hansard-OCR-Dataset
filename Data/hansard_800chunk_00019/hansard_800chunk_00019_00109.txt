been recently published in the daily prints some circumstances of a nature calculated to excite the attention and anxiety of all those who felt an interest in the complete accomplishment of that most important object , the Abolition of the Slave Trade , and that it was highly advisable that the most satisfactory information relative to these circumstances should be laid before parliament , moved `` That an humble Address be presented to his royal highness the Prince Regent , that he will be graciously pleased to give directions that there be laid before this House , copies of all communications from the governor of the Cape of Good Hope , and from the governor of the islands of Bourbon and Mauritius , received since the capture of those settlements respectively , so far as they relate to the carrying on of the Slave Trade in those settlements , or in any of the neighbouring islands . '' said , he did not rise to oppose the motion , but he could not refrain from saying that if an excuse were wanting for that sort of evasion of the Abolition Bill , of which the honourable member complained , it was to be found in that system of recruiting in Africa which had been lately established under the authority of government for the purpose of filling up the ranks of the Black regiments in the West Indies ; a system which , while it had the effect of reviving , nay and of perpetuating all the evils of a trade which had been characterised as inhuman and unjust , had , at the same time , the effect of inducing in the eyes of Europe , a doubt of the sincerity and good faith of our intentions on the great question of the abolition of that trade , and at a time , too , when as his Majesty 's ministers had before informed the House , they were using their utmost endeavours to effect a general 199 co-operation in the total abandonment of the trade , upon which that amelioration in the state of Africa which we contemplate must mainly depend .

He wished also to make another inquiry connected with this interesting subject . We had a chain of forts in Africa , which , during the existence of the Slave Trade , were used as depots for slaves . He was positively informed , that during last summer , the governors of some of these forts actually supplied no less than 47 Portuguese vessels with slaves .
