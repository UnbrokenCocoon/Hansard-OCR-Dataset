of talents , than for the honourable and manly candour , by which it was still further dignified and adorned , that , if there was no danger in relaxing the present restraints , I should likewise agree that they ought immediately to be relaxed ; for I am very ready to admit , that eligibility to public offices and seats in the legislature , ( call it a right , or a pretension , or what you please ) ought not to be abridged without necessity ; and when I say necessity , I mean a grave necessity , arising from apprehensions of danger , not chimerical and visionary apprehensions , but such as may affect men of firm and constant minds , of danger to some interests of the state , which are deservedly held dear and important . And when I describe the interests of the church of England and Ireland to be of that species and magnitude , I presume , I express , with very few exceptions , the universal sense and feeling of this House . But , Sir , I can not agree to this position of fact , that there is no rational apprehension of any danger , direct or indirect , to the established church , from any relaxation of these restraints . I do not mean to say , that the admission of Catholics to some of the offices , from which 1007 they are at present excluded by law , does not furnish a reasonable ground of apprehension ; in my humble opinion , our present exclusive enumeration of offices is too large ; and that some of those offices into which at present they are told they must not intrude , are offices to which their ambition might safely enough be allowed to aspire . But then I say , first , that , if any man has such offices in his view , with an intention of offering fair relief , so far as such offices are concerned , he ought to bring them forward , not as an appointment of a committee for general undefined grievances , but in particular bills in which they shall be submitted to fair and distinct and specific consideration ; and I say further , that no admission can , with any degree of safety to the interests I have described , be given to offices , which are either judicial , with a jurisdiction extending to ecclesiastical questions , or to such as convey , to the person who holds them , a great portion of political power . For these are the two principles , within the range of which , I conceive the danger , and the necessity of providing against it , to be bounded . The office of the common law for instance , is one from which a Catholic ought to be excluded . And , why ? Because a person , in that situation , has to decide most important questions , intimately connected with the safety of the Protestant establishment , of religious questions , of rights of advowsons , presentations , tythes , offerings , modusses , church rates and a thousand others ; and I would ask that hon . gentleman , whether , if he had a son or a brother in the church , he would , with his experience of mankind , think that his son or brother would confidently trust a Catholic judge , sitting to decide many of such questions , between the Protestant clergyman and the Catholic parishioners ; and whether there would not be that distrust , and suspicion of an improper bias , which might disturb the fair course of justice , even if that suspicion and distrust were not itself an evil , which is the duty of prudent institutions entirely to remove , by removing their natural causes . So with respect to the office of privy counsellor , who has to advise the sovereign in matters of religion , which are then matters of state , in some degree , though , in a still higher degree , matters of
