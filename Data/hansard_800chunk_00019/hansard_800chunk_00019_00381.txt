at law , clerks in chancery , attorneys , practitioners of law and physics , but that they might freely use the same ! Why , Sir , do I mention these historical facts ? Not for the purpose of raking up the embers of ancient animosities , but for the purpose of shewing that , in restoring the privileges of the Catholics , we are performing an act of justice , and vindicating the Revolution from the stain of this act of perfidy ; —men who have forgotten every circumstance of that great event , which connects it with the cause of civil and religious freedom , affect to call this breach of faith and honour , one of the sacred principles of our constitution . It is a miserable perversion of understanding , which can forget every thing sacred and animating , in that glorious struggle , which can fling away , as dross , the precious attestation , which it bears to the just rights of the people , which would bury in eternal oblivion , the awful lesson which it has taught to their rulers , but consecrates and embalms this single act of injustice , which disgraces it . Sir , I am satisfied that the illustrious persons , who perfected the Revolution , were not aware of the injustice done to Ireland ; in the crowded events of that day , the stipulations might not have been fully known , and there have been , at all times , a set of slaves ready in this country , to defame and to defraud their native land , to traffic on the calamities of their countrymen . I will go further and suppose that the severe necessity of the times may have made it impossible to avoid an act of injustice , —but I will not therefore confound the deviation with the rule ; I can not trample on the principle and worship the exception.—It might as well be said that , to restore the Danish fleet would be a violation of the laws of nature and of nations , because a deplorable necessity had compelled us to violate these laws by seizing it . I have , perhaps , dwelt too long on this part of the subject , but I felt anxious to meet the cry of this great charter of our freedom being at variance with the rights of the people . The great men of that day had deeply studied the laws and constitution of their country ; 808 with ardent feeling and sublime conceptions , they made no unnecessary breach , on any ancient usage ; no wanton encroachment on any rights of people or of king ; not like our modern improvers , who hold for nothing the wisdom which has gone before them , and set up their own crude conceptions , with an utter contempt for all the sacred lore of their ancestors . They committed no rude outrage on those who had gone before them ; they entailed no odious bondage on those who were to succeed them—with the modesty and simplicity which characterize great minds , they declared the essential rights of the constitution . They saw that the system of the reformation would be incomplete , unless the king , who was the temporal head of the church , should be in communion with that church ; they therefore enacted that he should hold his crown only while he adhered to his religion . They declared the throne unalterably Protestant—they declared the religion of the state unalterably Protestant ; and , having thus laid the firm foundation of civil and religious freedom , they left all other considerations open to the progress of time and to the wisdom of posterity . That time has come , and that posterity is now called upon to decide—we are fighting the same battle , in which the illustrious deliverer of these countries was engaged—we are defending the liberties of Europe and of the world , against the same unchangeable and insatiable ambition which then assailed them—we are engaged with an enemy , far more formidable than Louis
