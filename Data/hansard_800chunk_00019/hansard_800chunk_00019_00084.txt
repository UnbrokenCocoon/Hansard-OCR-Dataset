be permitted to say , that if there were any persons who had seen the difficulties of the war in the peninsula in a stronger light than others , —who thought the means of carrying it on were very imperfect , —and who , though admiring the patriotism of the Spanish people , yet feared that the organization , civil and military , in that country , was 141 not such as afforded security for effectual co-operation , —the greater they felt these difficulties to be , in that proportion must be their admiration of the talents of the general who had met , and , in many instances , gloriously surmounted them . The campaign , indeed , must be characterized as one of various fortune : yet out of this very circumstance , there arose a display of military talents in the commander which would not otherwise have appeared . It was rendered evident that , whether the general pursued the triumphs gained by himself , or experienced disappointment from extraneous circumstances , he was no less capable , by his rare talents , of alleviating misfortune , than of improving success . In reviewing the military transactions on the peninsula for the last three years , if he were qualified to decide at all on the subject , those which he would rest upon with the highest admiration , would be such as occurred under the circumstances when lord Wellington was forced to retreat before a superior force of the enemy . However unfavourable the circumstances , he had always , on these occasions , preserved his army and its resources entire , and fit for attack when the proper moment for attack should arrive . In these circumstances , his great mind shone more eminently conspicuous in availing himself of the difficult circumstances of the country for the protection of a retreating army , and for maintaining his communications with his resources . Such was the retreat of the marquis of Wellington to his lines at Torres Vedras , —such was his retreat before the battle of Salamanca , —a retreat converted in a moment into a brilliant victory , where a superior enemy was checked , and forced to retrace his steps . Such , too , was the present retreat to the frontiers of Portugal , —all of them evincing the greatest military genius in the commander.—Having said thus much as to the merits of the marquis of Wellington , there was another subject of congratulation to their lordships and the country , which he wished to touch upon , although it could not well be embodied in any resolution of that House . No man who had attentively watched the conduct of the marquis of Wellington and the officers under his command , could fail to have observed , that a military school existed in the peninsula , in which a race of officers were forming , on whom the country might rely with confidence in the future military career , which in all probability it had yet to run . 142 Such a school could not , indeed , be formed without great sacrifices ; such , for instance , as those which were made in the siege of Burgos , where , besides regret for the failure of the object , one could not help feeling an additional pang at the fall of so many brave officers , and especially of colonel Somers , who , if he had lived , promised to have added to the other glories of that illustrious name , that of the highest military fame and glory . Notwithstanding such losses , many officers must be formed by the marquis of Wellington , who , having the advantage not only of his instructions , but of his example before them , must be capable of rendering the highest services to their country . He thought it right to advert to this circumstance , as it appeared to be a favourite object with the marquis of Wellington , who , in the intervals of war , kept several of the officers about him , who had thus
