acted on , it should be frankly received and honestly forwarded ; every facility for its accomplishment should be afforded , by tempering and directing the proceedings of those who seek it ; by suggesting the conditions and terms on which it should be granted ; and by arranging the details , as well as by planning 816 the outlines , of such a system . But how can any honest mind be reconciled to the ambiguity , in which the cabinet has concealed itself from public view , on this great national question , —or with what justice can they complain of the madness , which grows out of this fever of their own creating . This is not one of those questions which may be left to time and chance ; the exclusion of these millions , from the rights of citizenship , is either a flagrant injustice , or its necessity springs out of the sacred fountains of the constitution . This is no subject of compromise . Either the claim is forbidden , by some imperious principle too sacred to be tampered with , or it is enjoined by a law of reason and justice , which it is oppression to resist . In ordinary cases it sounds well to say that a question is left to the unbiassed sense of parliament and people ; but , that a measure of vital importance , and which has been again and again discussed by all his Majesty 's ministers , should be left to work its own course and suffered to drift along the tide of parliamentary or popular opinion , seems difficult to understand , —that government should be mere spectators of such a process is novel ; but , when it is known that they all have considered it deeply , and formed their opinions decidedly in direct opposition to each other , that , after this , they should consult in the same cabinet , and sit on the same bench , professing a decided opinion in point of theory , and a strict neutrality in point of practice ; that , on this most angry of all questions , they should suffer the population of the country to be committed in mutual hostility , and convulsed with mutual rancour , aggravated by the uncertainty of the event , producing , on the one side , all the fury of disappointed hope , on the other side malignity and hatred , from the apprehension that the measure may be carried , and insolence from every circumstance , public or private , which tends to disappoint or to postpone it ; one-half of the king 's ministers encouraging them to seek , without enabling them to obtain , —the other half subdivided ; some holding out an ambiguous hope , others announcing a never ending despair . I ask , is this a state in which the government of the country has a right to leave it ? Some master piece of imperial policy must be unfolded , some deep and sacred principle of empire , something far removed from the suspicion of unworthy 817 compromise of principle for power , to reconcile the feelings of the intelligent public , or to uphold a rational confidence in the honesty or seriousness of the government . Sir , the consequences of such conduct are disastrous , not merely in the tumult and discord which , in this particular instance , they are calculated to excite , but in their effect upon the character of the government and the times . Sir , I repeat it , the Irish Catholics have not been fairly dealt with ; the government has not , in any instance , come into amicable contact with them ; it has not consulted , nor soothed , nor directed them ; it has addressed them only in the stern voice of the law , in state prosecution , and it is most unjust to charge against them the anger , which has been kindled by such treatment : but , Sir , I ask what have the Catholics done ? Look to their
