prevent , if possible , that gradual alienation of mind which , being the natural result of their present exclusion , might hereafter render them utterly incapable of moral or political coalescence with us , 966 the Protestant part of the community . Now , Sir , I consider the established church , in full enjoyment of her possessions and endowments , her doctrine , worship , and discipline , to be as essential a part of the British constitution as our monarchy or liberty itself ; and that every measure , calculated to injure that establishment , calls for as vigorous a resistance as an attack upon the most fundamental part of our constitution . Were the code of securities , which has existed for the last century , necessarily to be considered as perpetual , as I hope and trust that church will be , I conceive that this House never would have entertained the present question , whether we shall or shall not consider the propriety of devising some new system . But , I do not find that this code is , by our constitution , deemed so indispensable . I find that , when many of those , who framed the acts of the Revolution , must have still existed , while at least their spirit and principles invigorated our councils , I mean , in the union between England and Scotland , the oaths , which have alone bolted our doors against the Roman Catholics , were positively enacted to be taken by the members of the legislature , only `` until the parliament of Great Britain shall otherwise direct ; '' and this , in the very articles , which , by a carefulness and caution of expression , which precludes even the possibility of doubt or evasion , provide explicitly , as a fundamental and unalterable condition of union , â€”that the respective church establishments shall be perpetual and immutable , so far as perpetuity and immutability can belong to any thing , which is mortal ; The distinction clearly intimates , in my mind , that , in the contemplation of those who framed that union , some time might come in which the excluding oath would be no longer necessary . Proceeding , onward , I find , that the legislature , by its enactments , of the latter half of this reign , has pointed out the near approach of such a period ; that many great statesmen , who , on other points , have stood opposed to each other , in the very front of the battle , have united on this subject , and given the powerful sanction of their concurring testimony to the expediency of some change , and that at no very far distant time . I find , Sir , that , not many months ago , this point of time was more distinctly marked ; and that , by a great majority of 967 the last parliament , the present session , perhaps even the present night , was declared to be a fit occasion for taking this great question into our most serious consideration ; and , if I may be allowed , without disrespect , to draw another argument from the nature of the opposition generally made to the present motion , I would observe , that most of the objections rest , not on the perpetual , but on the present necessity of exclusions ; thus allowing that the existing species of security is not always necessary ; and , consequently , that , whether at this moment it be necessary or not , is a fair subject of consideration ; and , when I see that the right hon . mover of the resolutions , in the last parliament , and the right hon . proposer of the present question , have a plan of securities to propose , I do think it fair to them , and due to the petitioners and the country , to give the subject a full , a deliberate , and dispassionate investigation . Beyond this I do not pledge myself to
