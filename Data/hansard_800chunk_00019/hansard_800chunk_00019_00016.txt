that inactivity , so injurious to the objects of the war , it was for ministers , in their diplomatic management with Sweden , to account . This account , indeed , they were bound , for their own justification , to produce . At a meeting which had taken place at Abo about the end of July , between the emperor Alexander , lord Cathcart , and the crown prince of Sweden , it was understood to have been arranged , that the expedition already alluded to , was to have been dispatched from Sweden ; and so cordially it seemed did ministers enter into the project—so promptly did they determine to forward its progress , with a view to impede the army of France , that transports for the conveyance of the Swedish expedition were ordered to sail from Sheerness on the 19th of September , and Buonaparté entered Moscow on the 14th of the same month ! So fared this grand and much 33 talked of expedition . What sort of explanation ministers had it in their power to give upon this subject , he could not pretend to conjecture ; but it appeared most extraordinary , that after the meeting and discussion he had just mentioned , ministers should not have been enabled to judge of the real disposition of the crown prince of Sweden , or that they should not have taken measures to ascertain whether any change had taken place in that disposition before the useless dispatch of the transports.—With respect to Russia , while he was fully disposed to concur in the panegyric pronounced upon the magnanimity displayed by that power , he would ask , what assistance had our ministers afforded to encourage the display or to aid the operation of that magnanimity ? This he was at a loss to know , except the sending the Russians about 50,000 arms , with lords Cathcart and Walpole , who were no doubt important instruments to aid a great empire in extricating itself from its difficulties and repelling a formidable foe , were to be viewed in this light . Upon the subject of America he thought it necessary to say a few words ; and first he had no hesitation in asserting , that a more unjust attack was never made upon the peace of any nation than that of the American government upon this country , nor could any cause be imagined more completely just than that which this country had to oppose to America . But he must confess that he heard with surprise the passage in the Speech from the throne , which sanctioned the opinion that ministers still hoped for pacification with America in consequence of something done previous to their declaration of war ; he meant with surprise , in consequence of the grounds upon which this hope was understood to rest . Nothing appeared more preposterous than the calculation that the repeal of the Orders in Council would serve to pacify America ; for these orders were never in fact the point at issue . Of the conduct of this government throughout its discussions with that of America , he was pretty accurately informed , and he was fully prepared to defend it , especially that part of the discussion in which he was personally concerned . But he would maintain , as he had uniformly slated , that the dispute with America did not originate or rest upon the Orders in Council , but referred to higher questions , to topics deeply affecting our great maritime rights , to points , indeed , of such importance , that 34 according to his fullest conviction , the British government could not concede to the pretensions of America without throwing into her hands the trident of the main . It would not avail ministers to repeat the assertions of those who expressed such sanguine opinions as to the probable result of the repeal of the Orders in Council , for these assertions furnished no answer to his view of the subject . They might indeed be adduced in reference to some noble lords near him , from
