go ; but I must say that it is my ardent wish , as it would be most gratifying to me , to find , that , in the altered tone and temper of these times , and ( if I may so speak ) in the more liberalized spirit and feeling of the Roman Catholics themselves , a foundation has been silently and gradually laid , on which we may venture to erect new bulwarks , as effectual to the support of our venerable establishment , as that rampart of exclusion , which , while it has fenced and protected her from the assaults of her adversaries , has , also , it must be allowed , closed against our Roman Catholic brethren , many avenues of conciliation and return . It is not for me to trouble the House with my arguments on this great question ; but , as I observe , that a very strong objection has been taken , even to its consideration , on the ground of an inveterate hostility , which , it is said , must exist , in the minds of the Roman Catholics , against all , Without the pale of their communion , it may not be unimportant to advert to some facts , which have not been noticed by those gentlemen whose deep and eloquent reasonings have so enlightened this and every other part of the subject , but which strongly indicate better feelings , and a more conciliatory disposition towards us . I allude , Sir , to facts recorded in the 14th Report of your Commissioners of Irish Education , that the children of Roman Catholic parents are very frequently cent to the charter schools , where they 968 must necessarily be educated in the Protestant faith ; that , in many parts of Ireland , they are sent , indifferently , to Protestant and Roman Catholic masters ; and , in short , in one instance , where the priest interposed to withdraw the youth of his flock from the heretic teacher , one-fifth remained in disregard of his authorityâ€”in a matter too , be it recollected , not less of a spiritual , than a temporal nature . Again , an instance of the relaxation of prejudice ( inherent , as it is said , even in the higher ranks ) , may be observed in the increasing numbers of Roman Catholic students , who enter at Trinity College , Dublin : and even in the priesthood itself , it will surely be allowed that some abatement of their ancient spirit may be traced in the far more general and unrestricted use of the Scriptures , now permitted to the laity of every rank . If I might venture to add yet another instance of the declining antipathy of the Roman Catholics to all recognition of another faith , I would take the liberty to mention one , which fell more immediately within my own observation , when I had the good fortune , two years since , to spend some little time in the sister island . Among the many kind and friendly hospitalities which I there received , I had the pleasure of being admitted to the intimacy of a most respectable clergyman of our own establishment , in the south . This family , which was not small , was composed , indifferently , of Protestant and Roman Catholic servants . The parish , in . which he resided , contained a large proportion of Roman Catholics , under the immediate superintendance of a titular bishop , whose name , were I to mention it , would be recognized as one not the least distinguished for a zealous attachment to the high doctrine and discipline of the Romish see . When evening came , and , with it , the hour of family worship , those Roman Catholic servants , with the knowledge , and by the express permission , of their titular bishop , knelt down by the side of their Protestant brethren , and united in one common prayer , from our Liturgy , to one common Father ,
