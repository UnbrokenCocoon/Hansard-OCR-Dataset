them likely to do . They had extracted matter of offence out of every negociation , however amicably it appeared to have terminated , and not unfrequently even from those in which injury had been alleged on the side of America , and actual and apparently complete atonement made on ours . The war which had thus commenced had been followed up by an armistice ; but if this armistice had been meant as an indication of a wish for peace , the tone and temper of the American government towards this country would have undergone a revolution , and far different grounds of adjustment would have been assumed from those on which they now stood . The great questions between the countries were , the Orders in Council , which it was customary in America to call an illegal blockade , and the impressment of our seamen . They might , perhaps , think that the former of these was taken out of the question by the armisticeâ€”that might be true ; he would not pledge the American government further than they were disposed to commit themselves ; but they ought not to have closed up every avenue to conciliation but those by having recourse to which we should make a surrender of our rights . Their ministers had even laid in a claim to indemnity for the vessels captured under the Orders in Council . Not satisfied with the forbearance manifested by this country in the revocation of these Orders , and the relinquishment of the blockade of 1806 , the American government claimed the abandonment by that of Great Britain of the future exercise of the rights involved in those Orders and that blockade . With respect to the Orders in Council , that question had undergone repeated discussions in the British parliament , and a variety of opinions had certainly been entertained and expressed on the subject ; 598 but he would venture to say , that those opinions bore on the commercial expediency of the measure rather than on any doubts as to the right and competency of this country to retaliate and throw back on the enemy the injuries and inconveniences which their Decrees were calculated to inflict upon us . This was a discussion , the renewal of which he wished to waive at that moment ; but he trusted , no individual would suppose , that his Majesty 's government could be so dead to their duties , and so insensible to the genuine interests and rights of the country , as not to be anxious at the very moment they modified the measures which had been previously adopted , with the expectation of conciliating America , and inducing her to embark with Europe in the general cause against France , so to guide their conduct as to leave the rights and claims of this country on the subject as clear and untouched as if no relaxation whatever had taken place . Unquestionably , he was prepared to contend , that his Majesty 's government had an undoubted right to issue the Orders in question , and that their justice and necessity at the particular moment at which they were issued , when the previous conduct of France was considered , must appear still more evident , as well as their foundation in the true and sound policy of the British empire . For whatever inconvenience a portion of the manufacturing interest of this country might have sustained in consequence of the interruption of the communication with the American market , he had no hesitation in stating it as his decided opinion , that had not the British government opposed to France measures similar to and retaliatory of the measures that France had adopted in hostility to this country , the commerce of France would have been as triumphant on the continent , as , until recently , had been her military career ; and the commerce of Great Britain would have sunk to the lowest state of depression . He begged therefore to be always considered as one of the most steady and faithful admirers of that system in which the
