which could be adopted , was to awaken in the people of Spain , a spirit of hostility to France , and to succour and aid that hostility upon a broad and extensive scale of operations . With our force and resources properly directed in that way great advantages might be expected , and final triumph be safely calculated upon . It was , indeed , perfectly clear , that the measureless ambition of the leader of France never would desist from its object , till some strong and energetic force should check its progress on the one side or other . If the Spanish nation could once bring themselves to feel that there was no evil , no human evil , scarcely indeed an evil beyond the verge of humanity , to be put in competition for a moment with that of submission to the government of France ; that loss of property , loss of relations , loss of all that was dear to them , loss of life itself , was small and insignificant , compared to that tremendous and overwhelming calamityâ€”submission to France ; if they could be brought to this pitch of patriotism and resistance , every thing might then be hoped from the contest . It was true , indeed , that the perseverance he had described was a species of which philosophy afforded no definition , nor history any record ; but it was by that spirit alone that any thing great could be achieved in the struggle between Spain and France . Our assistance co-operating with this general feeling , might have been productive of the utmost benefits . The great person who now ruled over the destinies of France ( for great he could not hesitate to call him ) would , it might be presumed , were such a system pursued , find himself , by the success of our arms , reduced to the necessity of abandoning the cause , or , his ambition , leading to the exertion of all his means and energies in this one quarter , would open the way for other enemies in 23 other parts of Europe , who would be eager to seize the opportunity of his reverses in Spain , to shake off the yoke of his subjugation ; he would be compelled to divide his forces , and thus present a prospect of more easy success to our combined efforts in the peninsula . Such was the view he had always taken of the contest in Spain ; and with regard to the spirit of universal hostility in the people , which he deemed so essential , he would assert , without fear of contradiction , that it had been produced in its fullest extent in the course of last year . He was not speaking of any thing which it might be thought he had no liberty to express : he was not alluding to any thing which had come to his knowledge merely through an official channel : he asserted only what every one might know , who had directed his attention to what had occurred in the peninsula during that period . He also knew it as a fact which no one would venture to deny , that the success of the British arms in Spain had been felt and considered in Russia , as the salvation of that country , and if it had not been for our triumphs there , the leader of France would have been able to direct a military force against Russia , so vast and overwhelming as to preclude the hope of that power 's resisting it with any prospect of success . But , was not all this foreseen , and was not this the very basis on which the system to be pursued in our present situation should be founded : What then followed from the fact ? The moment it was known that such effects were taking place ; the moment it was known that the desired action was commencing on the one side , ought we not to have pushed every effort on the other side ,
