physicians , we know that during the interval between 1788 and 1810 his Majesty was sometimes in a state of mind that rendered him incompetent to the consideration of those important matters of policy that naturally devolve upon the sovereign , and the person whose duty it was to submit them to the King , abstained from so doing in consequence of the distraction of the royal faculties . To what degree insanity existed : how far ministers presumed , under colour of the royal authority , to exercise the powers of majesty at a time when the occupant of the throne was unable to discharge the duties annexed to that exalted station , I can not pretend to say , but I can not help asserting , that from the testimony of the physicians there is strong ground to believe that the government of the nation was carried on in the name of the King by his servants at a time when one branch of the constitution was incapacitated by disease—when the situation of his Majesty 's mind did not permit him to perform 709 the important duties appertaining to his high office . Thus , then , there appear to have been two violent deviations from the established principles of the constitution of such a nature , I contend , as to be subversive of the interests of the throne and destructive of the security of the subject . The miserable fiction which was resorted to on those occasions , that which has been very justly denominated the phantom of royalty , electing and appointing an executive magistrate , was a deception too weak to deceive the most superficial observer : to my mind it seemed a most unnecessary consecration of an act completely illegal , to induce the Lord Chancellor , without any adequate authority , to affix the great seal , thereby pretending to give the royal approbation to a measure of which the King could have no possible cognizance . I could certainly urge many reasons that with peculiar force call upon the House at the present moment to come to a decision as to the mode of proceeding on a contingency which is possible , though , perhaps , not probable , and which if not provided against may again place the country in that situation in which it would be deprived of all legal government , in which the majority of this House might usurp and retain all the powers that belong to the crown ; my object is to prevent on future occasions this lawless assumption of authority , to destroy that pretence of necessity which it is plain never existed ; because , in truth , by the constitution of the empire , a choice , indeed many choices of legal remedies remained . This illegal mode of proceeding was , however , resolved upon , and the House not only took upon itself to nominate the executive magistrate—not only , on its own authority , resolved to supply a throne , which I insist was not , and never could be vacant—but it went still further , and usurped the power of declaring that restrictions should be placed upon the person they selected to invest with some of the prerogatives of the crown , all of which were bestowed by the common law for the benefit of the people . They proceeded so far in their assumption of authority , that the Prince of Wales was unwilling , under such conditions , to take upon himself the task of government . In that able letter written by his Royal Highness in the year 1788 , in which he so distinctly , accurately , and perspicuously defined the principles of the constitution , 710 and the insurmountable objections existing in his mind to the mode of proceeding suggested , he at length consents to act as Regent , with no other view than putting a period to the anarchy that prevailed , conceiving that the evils resulting from this line of conduct would be less than those that might arise from the continued abeyance of the third branch of the constitution
