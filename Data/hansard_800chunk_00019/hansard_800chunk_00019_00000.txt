rose , and addressing himself to the Deputy to the Clerk of the House ( who standing up , 3 pointed to him , and then sat down ) spake to the effect following : —The Message from the sovereign , which has just been delivered , having recommended the choice of a Speaker to the immediate attention of the House , it seems proper that we should proceed without delay to that highly interesting function ; a function which is justly considered as the ancient and un doubted privilege of the House , and the proper exercise of which , is of the utmost importance to the character and honour of the House itself , to the rights and liberties of the people , and consequently to the welfare , prosperity , and happiness of this great and extensive empire . A brief consideration of the principal duties of the office , and of the qualities necessary to their discharge , will in some measure assist in guiding us to a proper choice . The duties are many and arduous ; the principal of them appear to be—to arrange and conduct the various proceedings of the House , in its legislative and inquisitorial capacities—to preside over its deliberations , and enforce the due observance of its order and decorum—to communicate its approbation , to denounce its censures , to guard its privileges , to assert its rights , and to maintain its dignity . Added to these , the private business of the House ( as it is called ) forms no inconsiderable portion of the labours of the Speaker , in the present increased and improving state of the wealth , and population of the country . The proper discharge of these manifold duties , requires talents and attainments of no ordinary dimensions , and which are but rarely found united in the same individual , ' for there is hardly an eminent quality that can elevate or adorn the human character , which may not , in the execution of this high office , be occasionally called forth into exercise . To an understanding enlightened and highly cultivated , to learning extensive and various , to an ardent , yet well regulated attachment to the constitution , must be added , a profound and minute acquaintance with the history and laws of the country , and an accurate knowledge of the forms and regulations of parliament , as recorded in its voluminous proceedings , and as existing in unwritten usages and practice of the House . Nor should we overlook even the subordinate 4 qualities , of punctuality of attendance , and of expedition coupled with correctness in the dispatch of public business . Among the requisites for presiding over the deliberations of the House , and preserving its order and decorum , may be noticed a soundness of judgment united to a promptness of decision , a firmness that shall repress contention , with a suavity which shall soften asperity and disarm irritation , a temper not to be ruffled by rudeness or pertinacity , a patient vigilance that can bear the fatigue of protracted debate , but above all , a strict impartiality that shall secure the universal confidence of the House . The Thanks and Honours of the House would lose a part of their high value , if communicated by its organ and representative without dignity of manner and expression ; its reprimands and censures would be deprived , in some degree , of their corrective force and effect , if denounced without that tone and demeanour of authority , which commands respect . In watching over the Privileges of the House , and guarding them against encroachment , in asserting its rights and maintaining its dignity , we must look for independence above controul , and integrity beyond the reach of influence . With respect to the Private Business , it may be sufficient to observe , that it requires facility of access , urbanity and courteousness in intercourse , frankness in communication , an indefatigable industry in investigating conflicting claims , an attention that can fix itself upon minute details ,
