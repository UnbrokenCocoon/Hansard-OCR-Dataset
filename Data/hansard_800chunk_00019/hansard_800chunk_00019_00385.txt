rather inconsistent to take cognizance of the question , on the supposition that the interests of the two countries are absolutely the same ; and to decide it upon the principle that the rights of the one are essentially and un 813 alterably opposed to the wishes and to the safety of the other . But , Sir , I utterly deny the fact , that such is the sentiment of the people of England , â€”a pretty bold experiment has been made , and it has failed . The intelligent class of the English public , those who from property and from education , and from place in society , are entitled to sway the opinion of the legislature on this , or on any political subject , are , I firmly believe , friendly to a full discussion of the Catholic claims , and with a strong leaning in favour of liberality and concession , if they can be made appear consistent with public safety . This is a tribunal to which an appeal may be fairly made , and to which adequate and ample satisfaction should be given ; and there is no concession or sacrifice , not inconsistent with the essential principles of their religion , which the Catholics are not bound to make for the purpose . But , Sir , beyond this public , and to the dregs of the community I fear there are some desperate enough to look : I have heard something like a muttered threat of such an appeal ; but I do not believe , though there is much valour at present on this subject , that we need fear a repetition of the outrages of St. George 's Fields ; I do not fear that our ears will be again assailed by the hell-shout of `` No Popery . '' I have heard something more than an insinuation , within these walls , that this is a question in which the lower classes of the people are very deeply interested , and that their voice is , on this occasion , to be particularly attended to . Sir , the doctrine is rather novel in the quarter from which it proceeds , nor am I disposed to give it an unqualified denial . I should be sorry to contend , that the voice of any portion of our fellow subjects , however humble , should be disregarded ; if they complain of grievances by which they are oppressed , of justice withheld , or of any thing trenching upon their freedom or their comforts , they are to be heard with patient and with deep attention ; and the more humble the situation of the complainants , the more bounden the duty of the representative to listen to them ; but , on a subject like the present , where the legislature is called on to withhold the privileges of the constitution from a great proportion of the people , upon supposed principles of state government ; when claims of common right are withheld , in deference to sacred and mysterious maxims of imperial policy ; on such a subject , I 814 say , it is something more than absurdity to affect a deference for the shouts of the lower orders of the people . Sir , the apprehension of such an appeal being resorted to , need not affect our deliberations ; those who intimate such an intention know full well that , though the threat may be endured , the times would not bear the execution of it ; they know full well that , if parliament determines to pursue its steady course of calm investigation and liberal adjustment , there is no faction in the state , which can effectually interpose between the sovereign authority of the legislature and the just demands of the people . Sir , the conduct of the Roman Catholics of Ireland has been resorted to , as an argument for abandoning the pledge of the last session . Sir , I am not the advocate of their intemperance ; I am free to say that there have been some
