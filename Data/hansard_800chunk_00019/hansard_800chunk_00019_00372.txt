nor extraneous support ; let us take care that what we build about them does not endanger their foundation . 794 With regard to the language and tone of the petitioners , it has been said that minute attention and critical acuteness ought not to be applied to them : that they are not to legislate for this House , but this House for them ; and that it becomes parliament to legislate upon a grand scale , laying down such regulations as , to its own wisdom , may seem just and reasonable ; and leaving those , who are affected by them , to accept the intended boon , or to decline it : that it is not a matter of convention , nor bargain , for it neither becomes the legislative body to act in that mode , nor is there any other contracting party with whom we can form such an agreement . To this it may be answered , that every proposition of this sort must be in the nature of a contract , which , if not accepted , would become nugatory ; that , if the petitioners are to be believed , they are determined not to accept it ; and that an act , which promises , at best , to be only nugatory , but which carries a strong suspicion of being ungracious , irritating , and offensive , does not hold out any adequate inducement for entertaining this question , at a moment , when so little good , and so much mischief , may result from the agitation of it . If there are any members who might be induced to go into the committee , or to consent to bring in a Bill , in the hope that the minds of the Irish Roman Catholics would be tranquillized and conciliated by such a measure , I beg leave to repeat that similar expectations were held out last summer , as an argument for passing the Resolution , and that those expectations have been completely disappointed ; that there is less excuse for giving way to any such self delusion now , than in the month of June ; because those , in whose favour it is now proposed to make further relaxations , have , most unequivocally , proclaimed to the world that , unless they can have all , they will receive nothing at our hands . Here , therefore , is one great class of his Majesty 's subjects , whom all which is about to be done will not satisfy , nor content : will a still larger class be better pleased with it ? Look once more at the mass and multitude of the petitions upon your table , from the Protestants on both sides of the water , and judge whether a serious and extensive alarm is not excited throughout the united kingdom ! Can such a disposition of mind , and such a conflict of contending 795 sects contribute to union and strength ? or is there the slightest probability of attaining , by the motion of this night , any one of those three objects which the Resolution of the last parliament professed to secure to us ? I declare , with unfeigned concern , that whatever has passed in Ireland , upon this subject , from the month of June , to the present moment , so far from forwarding a final and conciliatory adjustment , appears to me to render it more difficult , and to place the period , at which rational hopes can be entertained of effecting it , at a still greater and indefinite distance . in explanation.â€”I never used the word 'foreign country ' as applied to England . I said 'another country , ' which I conceived to be a true description , as they are distinct countries , although united under one empire . As to the expression 'partizan-judges , ' I never used it ; that of 'partizan-sheriffs ' I did use , but I did not use it by itself , nor intending to imply that Protestant sheriffs were necessarily prejudiced
