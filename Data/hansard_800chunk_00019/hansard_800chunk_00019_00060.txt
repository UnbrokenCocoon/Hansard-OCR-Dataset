be of short duration ; and that it , therefore , behoves his Majesty 's faithful 100 Commons , to seize the earliest opportunity of submitting to his Royal Highness their view of the general situation of the country , and of laying before his Royal Highness the manifold griefs of his Majesty 's faithful subjects , praying that his Royal Highness will take such steps as to his wisdom shall seem best calculated for their relief ; and , at the same time , to promise our most dutiful and cordial co-operation . `` To express to his Royal Highness our hearty congratulations on the great successes obtained by his Majesty 's arms , under the distinguished command of general the marquis of Wellington ; and particularly on the glorious victory of Salamanca , prepared by the vigilance , decision , and skill of that great commander ; and achieved , through the favour of Providence , by the consummate valour of his Majesty 's troops , under his command . `` Nevertheless , to represent to his Royal Highness , our deep disappointment and concern , at finding that an event , which was followed by the evacuation of Madrid by the French , its occupation by the British commander in person , the withdrawing of the French garrisons from many of their military posts and fortified towns , the relief of various parts of Spain from the presence of the enemy , and the victorious advance of the British general into the heart of that country , has not been followed by such exertions on the part of its inhabitants , as might have been expected to spring from those feelings of abhorrence of French domination , and gratitude for British aid , by which his Majesty 's faithful Commons have been informed , under the sacred authority of his Majesty 's name , and they are still willing to hope , pervade the universal Spanish nation . `` More especially , because , at the same period , the power of France has been distracted by warlike operations , proceeding on the most stupendous scale , in a remote quarter of Europe ; and , for the second time since the horrible and violent aggression of the French emperor , he has been prevented from directing his undivided resources to the subjugation of Spain . `` To assure his Royal Highness that we will with all diligence , as in duty bound , proceed to enquire , with the assistance of such information as we have no doubt will be furnished by order of his Royal Highness , into the causes of the reverses which have so soon and so unexpectedly led to the retreat of the marquis of Wellington 101 before the French force , the unresisted re-occupation of Madrid by the enemy , and their unobstructed progress in pursuit of the allied army ; for the purpose of ascertaining whether these disappointments have arisen from weakness of counsel at home , and want of such support as it is in the power of the country to afford to the contest in which we are engaged ; or are attributable to causes irremediable and inherent in Spain herself , and that we will lay before his Royal Highness the result of our inquiry , with such advice thereupon as to us shall seem expedient . `` To express our thanks to his Royal Highness for the intimation his Royal Highness has been graciously pleased to give , that he will cause to be laid before the House of Commons , copies of the Treaties lately entered into with the sovereigns of Sweden and Russia , and of the additional Treaty entered into with his Sicilian majesty , and our hope that the stipulations contained in those Treaties , and the obligations incurred thereby , may prove advantageous to the general interests of this empire and of Europe . `` To convey to his Royal Highness our heartfelt sorrow , that the measures advised by his Majesty 's ministers , towards the conclusion of the last session of parliament , were not taken sufficiently in time
