consequences , indeed , which , from the recently disturbed state of the public mind , he could not , he must confess , contemplate without dismay.—But to return to the panegyric which the Speech contained upon the constitution , they might hope that it did not imply any hostile reference to the Catholic cause.—The noble marquis finally recapitulated the several heads of his argument with regard to the war in Spain , the Swedish diversion , the co-operation with Russia , the rupture with America , the calm and deliberate discussion necessary previous to the decision of the East India question , and the adjustment of the Catholic claims , and concluded with expressing his opinion , that increased exertion must be made to strengthen our army in the peninsula , or it would be cruel towards ourselves , and our allies to continue the contest—to persevere in an useless effusion of blood and expenditure of money . For without additional strength , he was persuaded that the object of the war could not be attained , and that the continuance of the struggle , instead of being advantageous to this country , to Spain , or to the continent , would have a directly different operation . Having expressed these opinions , it was not his intention to propose any amendment ; but he trusted that such attention would be paid to the suggestions he had thrown out as their validity might demand from his Majesty 's ministers , whose system if longer pursued it would be impossible to endure . rose in reply to the statements and reasoning of the noble marquis , from whom he differed in some as he agreed with him in other of the opinions he had just expressed . In none did he more cordially concur than in that which went to the situation of the country , which ought to be fairly , plainly , and clearly before parliament . 38 He vindicated the conduct of ministers , who were ready to submit the whole of their proceedings and policy to the strictest scrutiny , whether referring to the civil or military government of the country—whether referring to disaster or to triumph—whether furnishing matter for congratulation , or events to deplore . With respect to the conduct of the war , he had read enough of the history of wars to enable him to pronounce , that those who therein looked for unmixed success and exemption from every species of reverse or exemption from misfortune , built , indeed , upon an unstable foundation , and rested on hopes which must turn out to be chimerical . But he trusted that where misfortune occurred , the mind of parliament and the public was too considerate and just , not to distinguish between that which was attributable to the contingencies of war and which resulted from inevitable circumstances , and that for which ministers or their agents might be deemed fairly responsible . The war in the peninsula , —he repeated the opinion which he expressed at the outset—the war in Spain he regarded as a new era in the history of modern wars , because in that case the people were most active in repelling their invaders . Unlike the people of Germany and Italy , who were passive spectators of the conflict produced by French invasion , the Spaniards were most forward to contend for the independence and old establishments of their country , therefore their cause held out an encouraging prospect and a good example , which the people of Russia were now so nobly emulating . It was this exhibition of a high national spirit which originally induced him to become an advocate for those measures of assistance which the Spaniards had received from this country . Indeed if this country had not afforded that aid , it would , in his judgment , have betrayed an indifference , not only to every high sentiment of liberty , but every , even the most common notions of policy . But while his object was to assist Spain , to afford to the Spanish people and to Europe the
