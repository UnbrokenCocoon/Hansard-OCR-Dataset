be of any avail . They adopted a system , which was published in the early part of the summer , under the title of `` Precautions '' , and which contained a most excellent plan of defence adapted to the peculiarities of the country , and calculated to harrass and annoy an invading army , and to wear them down by a continued system of partial attack , without incurring the risk which must necessarily attend a pitched battle with regular and veteran troops . This system was the best which could be adopted by that country , under its then circumstances , and might have produced a great effect upon the enemy , whose troops would have been continually harassed and fatigued , whilst the Spaniards , taking advantage of the peculiarities of their country , would have incurred little immedate risk , and would have gained a knowledge and attained a discipline which might have subsequently qualified them to contend in the field with the regular troops of France . This excellent system we forced them to abandon , by sending into the interior of the country a British army : it then became impossible for the Spaniards to leave our army to fight their battles by itself ; our army would , of course , proceed in the manner and according to the usual routine of a regular army ; and thus the Spaniards were forced on to engage in pitched battles , at a period when they were not competent , with regular troops , whilst the British army , too small to cope with the great superiority of troops brought into the field by France , can only retreat . In this way , my lords , I contend that the sending a British army into the interior of Spain has been actually injurious to the cause of the Patriots in that country.â€”I waited anxiously towards the close of last session for some communication on the subject of Spain , which I. did expect Ministers would have made for the purpose of obtaining the decision of Parliament . Had such a communication been made , I should certainly have delivered my opinion as to the impolicy of sending British troops into the interior of Spain . Ministers , however , chose to act without asking the advice of Parliament , and in what way have they contributed to the assistance of the 'Universal Spanish Nation ' , as it has been called ? In what manner have they 14 afforded the aid of which they now so much boast ? Setting aside for a moment the consideration of the general question of the policy or impolicy of sending British troops into the interior of Spain , it may be said , that there was a time when a British force of 30 or 40,000 men might have contributed to obtain a great temporary advantage , which , whatever effect it might have had upon the ultimate fate of the war , would at least have enabled the Spaniards to arrange their defence , and to mature their preparations . It may be said , that there was a period of the contest , when the French having been driven from Madrid , and forced to take refuge in the neighbourhood of the Pyrenees , a British force , sent there at that particular crisis , might have driven the French beyond the Pyrenees , and placed in the hands of the Spaniards the keys of their country , which they might then have been enabled to defend under infinitely more advantageous circumstances than they had since been placed in . It might be said , that this case did , from peculiar circumstances , actually occur . Allowing it to be so , how was it taken advantage of ? One might have supposed , that , to make the proper use of such an advantageous conjuncture of affairs , our troops would have been sent to the port nearest the scene of action , and from whence they might be marched , in the shortest time , to the spot where their services
