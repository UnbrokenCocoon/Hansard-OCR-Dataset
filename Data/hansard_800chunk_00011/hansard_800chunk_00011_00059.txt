the last offer of negotiation was made , he by no means meant to declare it as his opinion , that this country ought never to consent to the commencement of another negotiation , while Spain should continue in the hands of the French government.â€”On the subject of Sweden also he conceived that there was much room for further remark . We might probably be paying our 100,000l . a month , merely for the purpose of having that sum used , however reluctantly , by Sweden to assist in the endeavour to exclude us from the Baltic . He condemned the levity with which the subjects of Spain and Portugal had last night been treated by the 92 gentlemen opposite . Those gentlemen did not think they could possibly be called upon to answer for their conduct as culprits . When the day of investigation should come , he hoped that they would be able to exculpate themselves ; but if it should turn out that the country was involved in a very great calamity ; if the result should be that one of the finest armies that this country could ever boast , would be compelled to pass sub furca , then unquestionabiy it would become a matter of serious investigation , whether the fault lay with those who planned or with those who executed ; for to one of the parties it must necessarily attach . gave notice , that on Friday next he would submit to the house a motion relative to the Conduct of his royal highness the Duke of York , Commander in Chief of the British Army , with respect to the granting of Commissions , the making of Exchanges , and the raising of Levies for the Army . was anxious to be informed , by the noble lord opposite , as to the situation of two very respectable members of that house .
