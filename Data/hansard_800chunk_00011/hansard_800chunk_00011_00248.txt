to relieve us from this dilemma , and to place us in a situation more advantageous than could have been reasonably hoped for : namely , that of seeing the threats and projects of the enemy , as directed against us , rendered in a great degree abortive , and the `` evils of his own injustice fully retorted upon himself . '' — Amongst the reasons assigned for the rejection of this proposal , it was stated to be `` important in the highest degree , that the disappointment of the hopes of the enemy should not have been purchased by concession . '' Nor would it have been so ; for the proposal was not merely , in case the Orders in Council were revoked , to take off the Embargo as far as regarded Great Britain , but `` If France persisted in her unjust Decrees , to continue the Embargo as to her , and by thus giving it the place of the British Orders , to lead , with an efficacy not merely 793 equal to theirs , but probably much greater to all the consequences that would result from them . Unfortunately , however , his Majesty was advised to declare his intention to enforce these Orders , as long as the Berlin Decree remained unrepealed . He said unfortunately , because the condition which had been deemed indispensable , appeared to him most undesireable ; as he did not scruple to acknowledge it to be his wish , that , intercourse and harmony being restored between Great Britain and America , the Berlin Decree might remain unrescinded ; exposing the unavailing violence and injustice of the French Government , and irritating and rousing America to a sense of her true interests , which were , connexion with this country , and alienation from France.— On this view , however , of their duties to their Sovereign and their country , ministers had unfortunately taken their stand . To this condition , although the beneficial objects of their measure might have been otherwise more effectually secured , they were prepared and resolve to sacrifice not only the advantages arising from the application of American capital and industry to other purposes than those of internal trade and manufacture , but also those held out to us by the extensive and growing demands of the market of America.— But to these consequences of their pertinacity , ministers appeared to have been rendered insensible , or indifferent , by the circumstances which might be supposed to hate produced it.— At the precise period of the rejection of the overture , a prospect was opening in Spain , Portugal , and their dependencies , which they seemed unfortunately to have considered as having rendered the friendship , the conduct , and the market of America , comparatively unimportant to Great Britain . A spirit of intoxication , excited by success , which had the principal share in producing the Berlin Decree , seemed also to have occasioned the rejection of the overture from America . The avowed objects of their own measure , exceptionable in most respects as it has been justly deemed , appeared to be so completely within their reach , that ministers were fully entitled to congratulate themselves , and to take credit for its success : but for the chance of a triumph , paltry at best , by which too , if accomplished , that success would have been rendered less perfect , the proffered advantages were thrown away , and the probability of again bringing them within our 794 grasp could now only be effected by the timely and authoritative interposition of Parliament . Such was the purpose of the noble baron 's motion , which called upon their lordships , to obviate , if possible , the effects of past error on the part of ministers , by humbly recommending it to his Majesty still to accept the proposition from the united States of America as a basis of negotiation.— It had , however , been said that `` if third parties were sufferers from measures of retaliation against an unjust
