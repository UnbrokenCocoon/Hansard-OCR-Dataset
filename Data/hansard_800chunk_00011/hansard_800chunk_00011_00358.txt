liberal system of equal laws had not been established , which secures every man the property of his own labour ; which excites industry by guarding its produce ; which encourages genius by rewarding its exertion ; which constitutes the happiness , the glory , the fame , and the consequence of this great nation ? With such a picture in our contemplation , how was it possible to suppose that the Spaniards could make a glorious struggle , could submit to severe privations , could act greatly , under the influence of the Inquisition , and with no hope of bettering their condition ? What information ministers may have received upon these topics I know not ; I am in perfect ignorance ; and it is not a little extraordinary , that from the commencement to the termination of the contest by the expulsion of our army from Spain , the people of this country knew less of the real state of things , than in any former war in which this country had ever been engaged . When the emperor of France was carrying on war in the hereditary states of Austria , in Poland , and in Prussia , we had more information respecting his operations , than we had , when he was fighting against a British 1064 army in Spain , and even at a time when almost the whole of the ports of Spain were in our power . I appeal to any man , whether it be not true that the people of this country were more ignorant of what was going on in Spain , than they were of the progress of the Austrian , Prussian , or Russian campaign ? What may have been the extent of information received by ministers it is impossible for me to know ; but I must insist , that they should have taken all practicable means to ascertain the real disposition of the Spanish people ; what lengths all classes amongst them were inclined to go , and how much they were disposed to endure in the prosecution of the contest , before they should have committed in the heart of Spain , what was intrusted to them by parliament , the greatest British army that had ever been employed upon the continent of Europe , I mean that which was under the command of the late sir John Moore . The first step which his majesty 's ministers took in this campaign was the dispatching of sir Arthur Wellesley , with the force which had been assembled at Cork , to Spain . But though it must appear to any person who reads superficially the Instructions of the noble lord ( Castlereagh ) to that gallant general upon the occasion , which are contained in his letters of the 30th of June , that he was left , at liberty to act according to his own discretion in consequence of any information he might receive upon the coast of Spain ; yet it is also obvious that in fact that discretion was taken away from him by the Instructions of the 15th of July , and that the expedition to the Tagus was fixed on by the noble lord as that by which hostilities were to begin . When the gallant general arrived upon the coast of Spain , he thought proper to apply to the Junta of Gallicia and of the Asturias for information . By the former he was told , ( I speak from his own words , uttered upon a late debate ) that they did not want men to be sent into Gallicia ; that they considered the expedition to Portugal , and the dislodgment of the French from that quarter , as an object more desirable for them than to have the British army sent into their own country . The gallant general had at the same time admitted , that the Junta of Asturias at Oviedo had been desirous of having the co-operation of the British army in that province with a view to the expulsion of the French from St. Andero : whilst he explicitly declared
