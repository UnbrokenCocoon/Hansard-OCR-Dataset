the war originally for Holland ; had forsaken her , and benefited ourselves in the sharing of her spoil . It would not be easy to say , when we might calculate upon even as good terms as in the late overture we had been offered . We knew not what the next news from Portugal might bring us ; perhaps , before this , Portugal was re-conquered . The bubble with respect to the re-capture of Madrid by the Spaniards had already burst . Buonapartéwas hastening to fulfil all his prophecies ; if he had not already crowned his brother at Madrid ; he yet had the power of crowning him : he had certainly — however 231 gloriously for the British arms—he had yet , in effect , obliged us to evacuate Spain , and , perhaps , was now on his way to plant his eagles on the towers of Lisbon . With respect to Spain , he confessed the hopes he once had were nearly gone , and that the various reports from different quarters , from some , of the want of wisdom on the part of the government , from others , of the want of energy on the part of the people of that country , that such reports were not calculated to revive them . Whether it was want of enthusiasm in the original , as some said , or , as others more plausibly said , that that enthusiasm had subsided , he had not very sanguine hopes of the success of Spain.—The hon . gent , then concluded with moving the following Amendment : `` That an humble Address be presented to his majesty , to acquaint his majesty that this house has taken into its most serious consideration the Papers which have by his majesty 's most gracious commands been laid on the table of this house , relative to the overture made to his majesty for entering into Negociation by the powers of Russia and France.—To assure his majesty we would have witnessed with the deepest regret any inclination on the part of his majesty , to consent to the abandonment of the cause of Spain . At the same time to acquaint his majesty , that upon a review of the letter addressed to his majesty , the communications originally made to his majesty 's principal secretary of state for foreign affairs by the accredited ministers of the governments of Russia and France , it does not appear to this house that any such disgraceful concession on the part of his majesty was so required by the other belligerent powers as a preliminary to Negociation.—To stale to his majesty , that the stipulation insisted upon in the Official Note , transmitted to Paris by his majesty 's principal secretary of state for foreign affairs , as an indispensible preliminary to any Negociation , viz . That the government of Spain acting in the name of Ferdinand VII . should be admitted as a party , was unwise and impolitic , unnecessary to the maintenance of the great cause of Spanish independence , and obviously calculated to prevent all further intercourse on the subject of Peace— Humbly to represent to his majesty , that it appears to this house , that an overture made in terms respectful to his majesty ought to have been answered in language more moderate and conciliatory , and that im- 232 mediate and decisive steps ought to have been taken for entering into Negociation on the basis proposed in that Overture ; whereby alone it could have been discovered , whether there did or did not exist a possibility of effecting , through the means of Negociation ( combined with the unremitted and powerful assistance which his majesty was enabled to give to the Spanish nation , ) the rescue of Spain and Portugal from the usurpation of France , and whether Peace was indeed utterly unattainable.—Humbly to request his majesty , that he will be graciously pleased to avail himself of any opportunity which may offer of acceding to , or commencing , a Negociation for the restoration of the blessings of
