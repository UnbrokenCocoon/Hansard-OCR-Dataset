rose for the purpose of moving an Address to his Majesty thereon . His lordship began by observing , that he was persuaded he should meet the unanimous concurrence of that house in supporting his Majesty in the effectual prosecution of a war which the country is engaged in , for the purpose of securing and establishing uponsolid foundations the blessings of peace . He was equally convinced that , with respect to the proposals for opening a negociation with the enemy , the conduct adopted upon that occasion would meet with the approval of the House , and that in his exertions on behalf of Spain and of liberty , the sacrifices the country had made , and would make , would continue to be sanctioned by their warmest approbation . He entertained no doubt that whatever might be thought of the result of the war in Portugal , yet that the valour of our armies there must merit the most profound applause , and that the aid to be afforded to the king of Sweden , would be acknowledged the well-earned need of that gallant monarch 's fidelity and zeal in the glorious and honourable cause wherein he had embarked . And he no less anticipated the grateful sensation they must feel , that , notwithstanding the efforts of the enemy to injure our commerce , yet , that when their lordships took into consideration the fact , that , in spite of those efforts , our commerce had increased , and our revenues increased in proportion . Influenced by I these , sentiments he would not trespass longer upon the time of the House than just to move the following Address to his Majesty.—Here his lordship read the Address , which , as usual , was an echo of the Speech , and nearly the same as that which is inserted in this day 's proceedings of the house of commons . rose to second the Address , and said , My lord ; we can not express , too strong , our gratitude to his Majesty , not only for the transcendent situation in which we now stand as a nation , but for the whole of his able and judicious government , during so long a reign and under circumstances of unexampled difficulty.—His Majesty gra- 5 ciously acquaints us , that he has renewed his engagements with Spain , and observes that , there is no hope of safety but through a vigorous and persevering prosecution of the war , of which , I flatter myself , the great mass of this country is perfectly convinced , and it must he highly consoling to all Europe , to learn that his majesty is resolved most strenuously to support the cause of Spain . It is cur own cause ; —it is the cause of Europe and of the world ; and we can not but concur in applauding the determination of the Spaniards to persevere , to the last extremity , in the glorious contest , for their liberty ; —a resolution worthy of that noble nation . We can not but admire their spirit , when we reflect on the completely disorganized state , into which they were thrown by the treachery of an implacable usurper.—If they should not , in every instance , act according to our notion of what is expedient , or even if prejudice should prevent them from receiving assistance in the way we think adviseable ; —if their communications , among themselves and with us , should not be so prompt and perfect as might be expected from a country , whose government , and every thing derived from it , had not been recently dissolved , and overthrown ; —if we should observe among them , a degree of party spirit , or struggles for power , we should consider it as the lot of human nature ; and when we look among ourselves , ( and it is highly to be lamented , especially at this crisis ) , we discover the same . In short , if all these circumstances should exist , we ought still
