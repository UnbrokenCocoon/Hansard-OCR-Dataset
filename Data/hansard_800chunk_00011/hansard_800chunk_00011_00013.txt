adopted by his Majesty 's ministers , when the period came for discussing them , he was prepared to vindicate them both in whole and in part , but he could not even now suffer the noble lord 's statements to go forth to the public without making some observations upon them . The noble lord seemed to be of opinion , that the military assistance which this government gave to the Spaniards ought to have been confined to sending detached expeditions to particular points of the coast ; and to him ( lord Liverpool ) it appeared not a little extraordinary , that he should have objected to the policy of the expedition to Portugal , which was almost the only point of the coast which , at the time , was in possession of the enemy . It was the general sentiment of the people of this country , that the aid of government ought not to be limited to sending supplies of arms and money , but that succours in men should also be sent in support of a cause in which every individual felt the strongest interest . A large force had been prepared with unexampled expedition , and in its application ministers had taken the advice , not only of military men of high reputation at home , but had consulted the Spaniards themselves , who , both in the north and south , had recommended the reduction of general Junot 's army as the most acceptable service which it was in our power to perform . The consideration due to an ancient and faithful ally , who was then groaning under a foreign yoke , he admitted 24 to have had considerable influence with his Majesty 's ministers in undertaking the deliverance of Portugal . He requested also the noble lord to bear in mind , that at the time when our expedition sailed , and which he seemed to think might have acted with greater advantage in the north of Spain , the passage from Paris to Madrid was just as open as it is now ; and that the French army was in possession not only of the passes of the Pyrenees , but of a large district in the south of Spain.—The noble earl stated the advantage which had been derived from general Spencer 's small force , in facilitating the reduction of the army of Dupont , and , in consequence of the evacuation of Portugal , the Spaniards had been delivered from a large force , which , by acting in their rear , might have embarrassed and impeded all their future operations . His lordship also defended the equipment of the expedition to Portugal , and asserted , that in every respect , and specifically in the proportion of cavalry and artillery with which it was accompanied , it was perfectly competent to execute the service on which it was sent . Neither , he contended , hail there been one moment 's unnecessary delay in the march of our army from Portugal . If it did not proceed immediately to Spain after the conclusion of the Convention , it was , because no central government had then been established , and it was impossible to arrange any plan of operations with the provincial Juntas.—With respect to the Cintra Convention , there were some articles in it of which his majesty disapproved ; but these were not of a military nature , and he assured their lordships , that no information should be withheld by ministers , which might be deemed necessary to a lull and fair discussion of this or any other measure.—As to the Answer returned to the Address of the City of London , he was at a loss to see any ground for the noble baron 's observations . As far as it called for inquiry , no reflection or stricture was made upon it ; but when it prejudged the conduct of the officers engaged in that transaction , and the character of the transaction itself , by branding both with the strongest disapprobation before any inquiry could be had upon them ,
