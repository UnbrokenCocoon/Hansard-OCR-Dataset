interval which elapsed between his daringly heroic landing on the 8th of March 1801 , in Egypt , at the head of a small corps of British troops , in the presence , and in defiance of an insolent vaunting enemy , who , drawn out on the beach in all the pomp of military parade , threatened instantaneous destruction ; and the glorious action of the 21st , when this gallant chief fell in the arms of victory ; in this short interval were eminently displayed , every qualification requisite to entitle him to the love and confidence of his troops ; the esteem even of the enemy ; the enthusiastic admiration of the present age , and of all posterity ! At his death , the British were in effective force , little more than 9,000 rank and file , with 250 mounted dragoons , and their guns drawn by seamen . They occupied the sandy peninsula of Aboukir but with the inestimable advantage of having three times defeated the enemy in action ; on the last occasion , signally so . The French had effective , much more than double this number . ; a strong corps of cavalry , a species of force well adapted to that country , and an ad- 961 mirably well appointed field train ; they were in possession of all the resources ; all the towns and fortresses : their former successes had intimidated the inhabitants into submission , several of whom were serving in their ranks , and the Mamelukes , the only part of the population which could be serviceable as an ally , or formidable as a foe , were in alliance with them . They were , moreover , from long residence , accustomed , and in a degree prepared , to resist the diseases of climate . In this comparative state of the two armies , could he have chosen between the fate of sir Ralph Abercromby , and the perilous situation of the individual who had succeeded to the command , without hesitation , he would have preferred for his relation , the death of his lamented friend.—An officer , whose loss is much too recent , and too severely felt , to allow him at such a moment , to dwell even on the grateful subject of his fame , sir John Moore , a few days after the death of sir Ralph , in a letter to his successor , expressed himself thus , `` I hope you see some prospect of terminating this expedition with success ; left to my own mind , I own it suggests nothing comfortable . `` —An attack of the enemy 's lines and fortifications being deemed unadviseable , the commander-in-chief having left the strengthened position of the British before Alexandria , in charge of a highly meritorious officer , ( sir Eyre Coote ) advanced in conjunction with some Turks , and a small corps of British ( at first about 4,000 ) towards Rhamaniah , between Rosetta and Cairo , where it was hoped that another action with the enemy would decide the fate of Egypt ; but after a short ineffectual resistance , he fell back to Cairo . Having maturely considered the relative circumstances of the French and allied armies at that moment in Egypt ; the military operations out of which he had to select ; the manifold discordant materials with which he had to work ; the chances of failure ; the difficulties of success ; the General resolved on approaching to Cairo , with the united British and Turkish force.—Mr . Hutchinson refrained from troubling the house with a detail of the various and numerous inducements to this undertaking.—The General aware that the operation from which alone he conceived there was the smallest chance of conquering Egypt , would be attended with infinite peril , and not being so fortunate as to have his decision approved by those , whose according sentiments , at such 962 a moment , would have been most cheering and satisfactory ; persevered in this movement under the most awful responsibility.— After some delay ,
