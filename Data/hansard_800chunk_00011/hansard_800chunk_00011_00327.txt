moment , this war in Egypt . He treated the French general , doubtless , with that respect which his obstinate defence , and the privations his troops had so patiently endured , fully entitled him to ; but throughout , in the tone of a conqueror ! Menou attempted indeed to return to France , not merely with his arms and private property , but with the manuscripts , sarcophagi , and statues , which had been collected by Buonaparté and his troops , and were destined to perpetuate in France , the remembrance of the conquest of Egypt ; but this endeavour wholly failed . He evacuated Alexandria with 11,712 persons , which , with the garrison of Cairo , other prisoners , besides the killed in action , and those dead by wounds and disease , since the landing of the British , made the whole French force , captured and destroyed , exceed 30,000 men.—The immediate consequence of the total conquest of Egypt was , that the General , who had lately received instructions from England to apply a part of his force , after the termination of the war in Egypt , to the attack of Corfu , was thus enabled a few days after the surrender of Alexandria , to forward a corps , under the command of general Craddock , in execution of that service.—Thus ended , marked with every feature of victory , a campaign , greatly brilliant , throughout successful ; in all its points and bearings the most complete , that had ever been achieved by British heroism ; the only one too , in all respects perfect , during the last long eventful war . It commenced under the auspices of a gallant chief ( sir Ralph Abercromby ) , who , idolized by his troops , was , perhaps , more than any other man , the perfect hero in the fight , whose immortal fame was far beyond the reach of his weak tribute of applause ; and it was conducted to its glorious termination , by the friend , who most loved and valued , because he best knew him ; one , who notwithstanding his near affinity , he would proudly assert , united to the valour and firmness of the soldier , that scope of intellect , that mine of information , that inflexibility of principle , requisite to the general , as to the states man.—During the course of a tedious , painful , perilous command , his solicitude for the preservation of the health and lives of his soldiery , was as conspicuous as it was unceasing ; with the co-operation of the gallant and experienced officers , the 966 highly disciplined and brave troops , whom it was his good fortune and honour to lead , with their assistance , to have brought to a prosperous conclusion , with the least possible effusion of blood , this ever memorable campaign , has been a reward , a blessing conferred on his arms , far more estimable to him than the highest favours , or the most enthusiastic applauses , which his sovereign or his country could have bestowed ; and he ( Mr. Hutchinson ) trusted he was not too sanguine in expressing a confident hope , that this campaign would be recorded amongst the proudest periods of our military annals , while the consummate wisdom and humanity , of British officers , the valour and discipline of British soldiers so eminently displayed , shall be held up to all posterity as an example worthy of imitation.—He hoped that the house and the public would never forget , that in Egypt the enemy was , until the last , moment of the campaign , more than double the number of the British , and possessed of every military advantage ; that when beaten in the field , he retired behind his strong works , where he hourly expected reinforcements , some of which , under admiral Gantheaume , actually anchored on the coast . That in Portugal he was , during all periods of the operation , inferior in number to
