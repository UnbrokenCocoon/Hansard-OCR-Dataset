to respect and admire their general conduct , and not despond , even though great reverses should take place.—The military spirit of the Spaniards is wonderful , if we consider the numerous veteran armies to which they are opposed , and as to our own troops , we have reason to expect from them , every thing that can be done by men . They have the highest confidence in their general , whether he advances or retreats , and we should be satisfied that whatever may happen , a British army , so commanded , will not disgrace the character of our country.—I believe there are few among us who are not convinced , that general ruin must ensue if the war is not carried on with the utmost vigour , and that Spain is the country where the great effort should be made : and how great should be our exultation when we hear that , during such a war , our trade , on the whole , is not diminished . 6 The export of certain manufactures decreased for a time , but not very considerably , or by no means as much as was supposed . Buonaparté threatened to subdue us by ruining our commerce , or by the expence of the war . We may thank him for having made the experiment ; we are now relieved from all apprehensions on those points , for it is proved , that neither Decrees nor Embargoes can materially affect our trade , and that the flourishing slate of our finances enables us to carry on this expensive war , without any considerable loan or new taxes . As to the Embargo laid by the American States , I am confirmed in the opinion I always entertained , that it will prove much more beneficial to the empire than injurious : and we are indebted to the firmness of the present administration for a very great improvement in our situation , in respect to that country , and for the expectation that no machinations or menacing measures shall make us abandon those principles and that system , on which its greatness and power have been established.—It is by contemplating these circumstances that we discover the real greatness and power of this country , and which , I conceive , never can be destroyed but through our own misconduct . Look round the British Empire ; look to the East and to the West ; and we shall find it , notwithstanding this rancorous war , in as good a state , in all parts , as at any period ; —but these matters will be much more ably slated to the house by those capable of rendering them interesting to your lordships . said , that the Address just read was such , that no man who had a veneration for his sovereign , or a love for his country , could ever assent to . Some parts of it , which went to express a determined hostility to the common enemy , and which went to declare the firm determination to carry on the war against him , all must approve . But when he adverted to the manner in which that opposition to him had been conducted on the peninsula of Europe , it was wholly impossible not to express both sorrow and indignation . He would assert it in the face of the country , and in the face of the world , that it was the greatest disgrace that had befallen Great Britain since the days of the Revolution ; and this he openly declared , whether he took into consideration the manner in which the war was carried on in Portugal , or the way in which our troops had been sent 7 there . Transports were hired , and great merit was to be attributed to the ingenuity of ministers in providing these transports ; but the public ought to be undeceived upon that head ; there was not a tittle of merit in the case ; it was only going to market , and offering a little more than the market
