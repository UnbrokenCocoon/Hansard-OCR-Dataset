unwilling to add any other to the splendid instance just mentioned of what British valour could do when properly conducted . It behoved the country to mark , with extraordinary distinction , such extraordinary services . He should move for a Monument to the memory of sir John Moore , as an effectual incitement to those who survived him to merit the same great distinction , by imitating the example he had bequeathed them.—The noble lord then concluded with moving , `` That an humble Address be presented to his majesty , That his majesty would be graciously pleased to direct that a Monument be erected in the Cathedral Church of Saint Paul 's London , to the memory of lieut.-general sir John Moore , knight of the Bath , late Commander of his majesty 's forces in Spain , who after an honourable and meritorious life in the service of his country , which deeply laments his loss , was killed by a cannon bail in the battle of Corunna on the 16th of Jan. 1809 , where , by his judicious disposition and successful commencement of the engagement , he secured the complete repulse and signal defeat of the enemy , and the safe and unmolested embarkation of his majesty 's Army in the face of a French Army of superior force ; and to assure his majesty that this House will make good the expence attending the same . `` —On the question being put from the chair , rose and said ; There can , sir , be but one sentiment in this house upon the present motion ; nor is there , I am persuaded , an individual within its walls who does not feel that sentiment fully and forcibly . All minor considerations are forgotten in the involuntary tribute of national gratitude to the services that have added new splendour to the national character ; and when such a subject is before us , it is well that no feeling arising out of any political differences be allowed for a moment to interfere with the nobler sympathy by which we are bound , 143 in common , to acknowledge and commemorate distinguished service rendered to our common country .

I was glad to hear the noble lord do such justice to departed worth , and glad to perceive that he was so well inclined to do that justice . In all his sentiments relating to the merits and claims of the great man we have lost , I entirely concur , and join with him in the strong terms in which he has expressed them , as terms no less just than emphatic ; and if I had had no other cause for rising than merely to express my satisfaction at the speech of the noble lord , I should have risen to have done so . But , sir , I can not possibly stop here , injustice to the great man who was the object of the noble lord 's culogium . I trust that his sentiments may go forth , that the public may know what he and his colleagues really think of the services we are now called upon to recompence ; that they may be satisfied that the government of this country does know how to appreciate the value of one of her greatest ornaments , and that they may not be so far deceived by the obtrusive servility of a venal press as to conclude its sentiments on the merits of that admirable officer to be merely the echo of its masters . We are now assembled , with one accord , to do justice to the memory of a man whose loss has thrown a shade upon the splendour of victory ; and while we are so employed ; while we are paying the last pious tribute of our country to the sacred memory of her departed brave ; while we are rearing lasting memorials at once of
