and in the acts passed thereon , a power was reserved to his majesty of annulling the same , whenever such revocation should appear expedient.—That the Congress of the United States of America , alarmed at the dangers to which neutral commerce was exposed by the practical operation of the said Decrees , and by the system then known to be in the contemplation of his majesty 's government , and actually carried into effect by the said Orders , passed laws for laying an immediate embargo on all American ships and exports ; and that by the operation of such laws , all trade of export from the said states into this kingdom or its dependencies has been prohibited , and the commercial intercourse of his majesty 's subjects with the said States has been in other respects essentially impeded.—That in the month of August last , the minister of the United States , resident at this court , made to his majesty 's government an authorized and explicit offer of re-establishing the said intercourse ; proposing , that if his 1181 majesty 's Orders in Council should be repealed , as far as regarded the United States , the embargo imposed in the said States should he removed , as far as regarded his majesty 's dominions ; and adding , that if his majesty 's enemies should not rescind their Decrees , the said embargo should be continued as with respect to them.—That this offer on the part of the United States appears to us just in principle , and in its tendency highly advantageous to the best interests of this country : just , inasmuch as it removed all pretence of the acquiescence of the United States in the French Decrees ; which acquiescence was the only ground on which any right could accrue to his majesty to interrupt the innocent commerce of a neutral power : and advantageous to Great Britain , inasmuch as , though it should not have produced the repeal of the French Decrees ( the avowed purpose of his majesty 's Orders ) , it would have secured to this country the exclusive commerce of America , and her alliance against a power which would thus have been the common enemy of both.—That we believe and hope that it is still open to his majesty 's government to renew , on the basis of this proposal , the commercial intercourse between this country and the United States ; every interruption of which we consider as manifestly injurious to the interest of both countries , and calculated to assist the designs of our enemies , and to weaken our own resources.—That we therefore most humbly pray his majesty to adopt , without delay , such measures as may best tend to the immediate re-establishment of the commercial intercourse between his majesty 's dominions and the United States of America ; and to bring , by temperate and conciliatory negociation , all other points to a just and amicable conclusion , assuring his majesty of our firm and invariable support , in maintaining against every unjust aggression , and every novel claim , the antient and essential maritime rights of his majesty 's crown .

There were many arguments and practical conclusions , in the course of that able , fair , and eloquent speech , from which he differed , yet there were also many points that had his entire assent . He most heartily concurred in the general principles contained in the extract which he had read from the farewell Address of general Washington . The hon
