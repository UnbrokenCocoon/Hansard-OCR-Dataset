dawn of which were dressed in such brilliant and glowing colours ; which in their progress , opened so many pleasing , yet delusive hopes , but which closed upon us in darkness and brought us , wearied , disappointed , dispirited , and dejected to the situation in which we find ourselves at this day . I therefore hope , that I shall be allowed to occupy the attention of the house , and to draw it to 898 that part of the transaction , unfortunately but a part , connected with the Campaign in Portugal ; and in so doing , I am sure that in this house it will not be thought that any form of inquiry , that has passed already , or any thing that has borne the name of Inquiry , has been of a nature to preclude the expediency and necessity of this house taking up the inquiry itself ; because , with whatever respect I may view the individual and military characters of the persons who composed the Board of Inquiry assembled by his majesty 's command , I must say , that constituted as that Board was , and directed as its functions were , that Board was a tribunal more incompetent to give satisfaction to the country , more irreconcilable with all the known and received principles of law and equity in this country , than any that has ever existed . And in order that I may be able to state that my opinion is in conformity with the best authorities on this subject , I shall , without detaining this house by going into any discussion of those authorities , slate the opinions which they have held . I hold in my hand the opinion delivered by my lord Woodhouselee , on the subject of Courts of Inquiry . It is here asserted by that able authority , that although there is in his majesty a power inherent to convene such boards as Courts of Advice , vet still that their decisions have no binding effects on the party accused . And though it has happened , that persons suspected have been examined by them , the call was not founded in justice , nor can persons be compelled to obey them . In this opinion Mr. M'Arthur and Mr. Adey , two gentlemen who have also written on this subject , concur . But , sir , these are not the only authorities to which I can appeal , in order to support the validity of the opinion which I have given . There is in our history a memorable instance , in which the reference to such a court was pregnant with evils ; yet will it be believed , that this very instance , which had proved in its operation so mischievous , and in its consequences so pregnant with evil , was the very identical precedent on which the servants of the crown recommended to their sovereign the formation of the late Court of Inquiry ! I allude to the case of sir John Mordaunt , whose conduct was first submitted to a Board of Inquiry , which next sent him to a Court Martial , where he was acquitted upon the ground that the only evidence against him arose from his own 899 answers tending to criminate himself.â€”Such an example is of itself sufficient 10 satisfy the house of the inconvenience and disadvantages arising from that particular mode of inquiry . I therefore do think myself justified in asserting , that a Court of Inquiry held as this has been , opening its doors to the public , calling upon the very parties to give their testimony , and drawing from them information by which they were to be subjected to criminal prosecution , was a tribunal calculated rather to defeat than to promote the ends of justice , or to give satisfaction to the public . Even by the constitution of the Court itself , it was impossible for it to inquire into any demerits beyond those of the officers . The result of the opinion of that Court has been ,
