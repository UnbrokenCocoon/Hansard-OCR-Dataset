of sir A. Wellesley . He was the only relative of sir Arthur in 959 town , at the time the news of the Convention had arrived ; and although he had been applied to by several persons for materials to write in defence of sir A. Wellesley , he had uniformly refused affording any , observing , that he trusted that sir Arthur , on his return , would he fully able to vindicate his own character . was reluctant to trespass on the patience of the house at so late an hour ; but the concluding words of the gallant general 's ( Wellesley ) speech compelled him to rise . Having compared the Conventions of Cairo and Alexandria with that of Cintra , and drawn a conclusion favourable to the latter , and discreditable to the former , by stating that `` The French army in Portugal possessed advantages which the garrisons in Egypt had not , and that those who had to decide on the Convention of Cintra knew , that there were other objects for the British troops in Portugal , which the situation of Europe , at the period of the Egyptian expedition , did not hold out : '' he concludes thus , `` If the convention of Cintra be disgraceful , then are those of Cairo and Alexandria also disgraceful . '' Mr. Hutchinson declared himself amongst , the most enthusiastic admirers of the brilliant exploits performed by the hon . general , and his troops , while in active operation in the field ; he regretted that the public , unmindful of the indulgence due to the arduous situation of officers , when occupied in the discharge of painful and complicated trusts , too often Formed hasty and incorrect judgments , sometimes even condemned without investigation the most honourable individuals , and transactions highly laudable . He apprehended , that frequently in this country victory was mistaken for conquest , a flag of truce for unconditional surrender.— However decidedly he disapproved some parts of the Convention of Cintra , and the spirit of the whole , and had no doubt that that measure could not be defended by the precedents drawn from the Egyptian campaign , still less that a comparison could with justice be made to their disadvantage ; yet , had the honourable member satisfied himself by merely justifying under the celebrity of these proceedings , he would have remained silent ; but it will be in the recollection of the house , that this has not been the line of argument pursued ; for a severe and unmerited censure has been pronounced against the Egyptian expedition , when it is asserted , 960 tnat , the Conventions of Cairo and Alexandria are disgraceful , provided that of Cintra be considered in this point of view.— The proceedings at Cintra have already been condemned by the highest authority in the empire , his majesty , and by almost every description of subject , so generally at least , that no public measure for several years past , has been so universally reprobated . It is true , the house of commons have not yet pronounced their judgment ; but a resolution has been moved this night by the noble lord , and sentence of condemnation is at this moment impending ; under these circumstances , being intimately acquainted with the Egyptian expedition , and having the honour and credit of the officers and troops there employed sincerely at heart , he would little deserve a seat in that house , or estimation any where , could he remain silent , and permit slander such as this , and from authority so exalted , to pass unnoticed . To preserve unsullied for that meritorious army their fair and hard-earned fame , he must request the attention of the house , while he shortly adverted to some principal circumstances in elucidation of that campaign . —He would not venture to weaken by any faint representation of his , the impression which the transcendant merit of sir Ralph Abercromby had fully and justly made on the public mind ; in the short
