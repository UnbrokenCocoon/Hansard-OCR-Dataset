that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for Ireland . `` We have , said that hon . gent. , grain enough for both the purposes ; we can supply your wants and still have plenty left for distillation , and , if you forbid the use of grain in the distilleries of Ireland , you will not ( I almost thought he said you shall not ) save one grain of corn by your law . '' Are we to take this for granted , contradicted as it is by the petitions on your table , and by the lamentable evidence of excessive prices still progressively increasing ? Are we to admit the fact of the actual detection and destruction of unlicensed stills in Ireland as a proof that they can not be detected and destroyed ? Is it with the revenue law in general as we have heard it is occasionally with the tolls , 1131 where the gate-man opens the gate to the gentleman as he rides through , and asks , with hat in hand , if his honour pleases to pay to day ? If 150 private stills have in one district been destroyed in one morning are we to conclude that 150 rise at once from their ruins ? All illicit trade , even Irish illicit trade , must be carried on under risk disadvantage and extra expence , more or less , and could not exist except there was , in the provision of the law which it meant to elude , a commensurate premium to set against these disadvantages . This premium might be the subject of precise calculation , three shillings might not do it in some particular case where four shillings barely would , and five would put the matter past all doubt . This premium the measure of last year had held out ; this the Chancellor of the Exchequer of England confessed when he allowed that the trial had not been a fair one , and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland , while he denied it in words , yet admitted it in effect , by saying that if ever the distillation from sugar was again attempted in Ireland , he would advise that it should be subjected to a lower duty than that last year imposed . He represented the stills in Ireland as multiplying like the heads of Hydra , but even the monster Hydra had yielded at last to Hercules ; and really his rt . hon . friend had accomplished such mighty labours , that , with the help of major Swan for his Iolas , he ought not to despair of overthrowing and finally trampling under his foot this many-headed monster of Irish illicit trade . At all events , he thought it would not be adviseable for the house to afford to that gentleman a new opportunity of proving , by measures of his own contrivance , the truth of his favourite maxim , that in matters of agriculture legislative interference was not only futile but dangerous . His rt . hon . friend would doubtless at some future day convince the house from this bill , to which he had given its present shape , that if you desire to legislate with effect you must not introduce into your law the germ that will blight the fruit you expect from it.â€”There was nothing upon the table , nothing brought to the bar to prove the statements of the rt . hon . gent ; they were sustained only by good round energetic assertions , and by the influence of his commanding eloquence . He trusted that the house would not lay its discretion at the feet of the rt . hon . gent . but by recommitting the bill , with an instruction to extend its provisions 1132 to Ireland , give at least one fair trial whether for an object so generally momentous it was not yet possible to pass one uniform measure of legislation for the United Empire . expressed his conviction that if the bill were passed in its present shape , the most fatal consequences
