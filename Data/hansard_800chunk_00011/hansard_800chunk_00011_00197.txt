questions were pointedly answered ; the truth could never be found out , and the obloquy under-which the Duke of York had 480 fallen , by a combination of some of the most abandoned characters , could not be so easily removed , if the witness was permitted to evade answering a question which in his judgment was fair and reasonable . did not see any reasonable objection to the answering of the question , and therefore trusted the Committee would not relax . observed , that it was impossible to conceive that any thing more important could come before the house than the present investigation . He was of opinion , therefore , that the Committee ought to sit . again that day . He hoped , therefore , that gentlemen who had given notices of motions would agree to postpone them . The Committee was accordingly ordered to be resumed this day . moved , that the Mr. Tahourdin , mentioned by the last witness , should be summoned to give evidence at the Bar . observed , that as the Sale of the Writership was not connected with the Charges against the D. of Y. , it would not be proper to call Mr. Tahourdin . It might perhaps be done on the ground of discrediting the evidence of the last witness ; but as the affair was totally distinct from the investigation at present before the house , the farther introduction of it might produce much inconvenience : he would recommend it to the hon . member rather to move for a Committee up stairs , for the purpose of investigating the appointment in question . also recommended the appointment of a Committee . observed , that the house must be convinced , from what had passed , of the necessity of some legislative proceeding , to prevent the scandalous practice carried on in the sale of Commissions , and Places under government .
