that the last answer be expunged , as , if the letter should be decided to be evidence , it would be read as such . was of opinion , that the answer ought not to be expunged . thought , that , as the letter had , amongst others , been referred last night to a Committee , to ascertain which related to the business then in a course of investigation , and had been produced by that Committee , he could not see why it should not be read as evidence . referring to the Report of the Committee , staled , that the Committee , had not given any opinion , whether the letters are now , or were hereafter , to be considered admissible evidence . considered them as admissible evidence . declared that unless some understanding should be come to about it , he should feel it his duty to take the sense of the Committee on the question for expunging the last answer , if the hon . member should persist in pressing it . called the attention of the Committee to the circumstance that the letter which had been just read , purporting to be from Mr. Elderton to the D. of Y. , was without a seal . It had probably been enclosed in a cover to Mrs. C. to be sent to his royal highness or not , as that lady pleased , but it was found in the custody of Mrs. C. herself . stated his object to be to call the attention of the committee to the state in which the witness had come to the bar .

He admitted that the witness was in a state indecorous for a person at the bar of that house . But his evidence was not material enough to require so strict a measure as that of expunging it from the minutes . was not surprised at the feeling manifested by the hon . gent . for the dignity of the house .
