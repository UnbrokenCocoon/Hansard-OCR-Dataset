him with all our power ; thus evincing to the world , that Britain never forsook those who remained true to themselves and to their engagements with her . It would also have the good effect of establishing a character not to be shaken , that we never by indifference would create hostility , where by liberality we could make friends.—Upon a review of the existing circumstances mentioned in the Speech , it was clear that we could not support our part in the arduous scene without incurring much expence . But on this point he had no cause to expatiate , as he was truly happy to hear it asserted , that the public would not be materially burthened , as other means could be found to answer the exigencies of the times . It was also highly satisfactory to learn , that our revenues were in so prosperous a condition . Considering the means adopted by our enemy , and the exertions he used to destroy our commercial prosperity , though he never thought they would have the full effect designed and hoped for by the contriver , yet neither had he been sanguine enough to imagine that they would be employed so inefficiently , that , instead of doing us any injury , a progressive increase of revenue was the consequence . All the attempts of Buonaparté to undermine our national strength had failed , and the trial had proved that Great Britain was superior to all the opposition and schemes of deterioration the tyrant of the continent could devise.—The last topic to which he should call their attention was the military state of the country . As he had ever been a friend to the measure adopted in the last session of parliament , he rejoiced to find it had been so eminently successful . It was , however , necessary to provide for offensive as well as defensive war , as nothing contributed more effectually to a state of security than a vigorous prosecution of offensive hostilities . Never was our army in a higher state of excellence in discipline , equipment , or numbers , and he should be happy to sec some mode devised by which an increase could be made to its present superior establishment . These being his sentiments with regard to the principal subjects alluded to in the Speech , he begged leave to move , `` That an humble Address be presented to his majesty , to return his majesty the Thanks of this house for the gracious Speech which 34 his majesty has directed to be delivered by the Lords Commissioners : To assure his majesty , that we are met together with a determination cordially to support his majesty in the prosecution of a war which we are well convinced there is no hope of terminating safely and honourably , except through vigorous and persevering exertion : —To express our humble acknowledgments to his majesty for having been graciously pleased to direct to be laid before us , copies of the proposals for opening a negociation which were transmitted to his majesty from Erfurth ; of the correspondence which thereupon took place with the governments of Russia and of France ; and of the Declaration issued by his majesty 's command on the termination of that correspondence ; and to assure his majesty that we will lose no time in taking those Papers into bur most serious consideration : —To congratulate his majesty on the strong assurances which his majesty continues to receive from the Spanish government of their determined perseverance in the cause of the legitimate monarchy , and of the national independence of Spain ; and to state that we rejoice in the determination expressed by his majesty , that he will continue to the people of Spain , so long as they shall remain true to themselves , his most strenuous assistance and support : —Humbly to express the satisfaction which we feel in learning that his majesty has renewed to the Spanish , nation , in the moment of its difficulties and reverses , the engagements which his majesty voluntarily contracted at the
