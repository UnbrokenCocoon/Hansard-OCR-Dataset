belligerent , they were to seek redress from the originally offending power . '' Without stopping to make upon this assumed principle the observations to which is was liable , the noble lord said it was enough to state to those , by whom it was advanced , that such had been the conduct of America : she had not only sought redress from France , but demanded it in a manner , which evidently shewed that , in the event of an accommodation with this country , redress , or war , was the only alternative . The same proposition was made to each of the belligerents , and having been rejected by Great Britain , he should be apprehensive indeed that it would be accepted by France , was it not for the known and hitherto inflexible pertinacy of the ruler of that country— To guard , however against sin h a possibility , it was material that no time should be lost : it was also highly desirable to allay and stop the progress of the irritation created in America , which had nearly silenced the friends of Great Britain in that country and united Federalists and Republicans in a common sentiment of indignation , excited by supposed injustice and apparent contempt . Still , however , he was decidedly of opinion , that war itself was far preferable to the concession or compromise of any maritime right founded upon the established principles of maritime law which , was equally binding on all countries . On this basis rested what was called the rule of the war of 1756 ; and to the principle of that rule , instead of the system of `` pernicious indulgence '' commenced in 1794 , we must recur and inflexibly adhere , unless we meant to allow the enemy advantages arising from his own weakness , and to forego those which were due to our own strength ; unless we had ceased to feel the importance of impairing to the utmost of our power some of the most valuable sources , of the revenue , the commerce , and navigation of France , and of cherishing and preserving those of Great Britain . The 795 urgent expediency and necessity of this just policy increased in proportion to the extension and consolidation of the dominion and influence of the enemy on the Continent : it was the only instrument by which we could balance his power . Non ill imperium Pelagi sævumque tridentem , Sed mihi sorte datum , might be confidently asserted by Great Britain ; but we must act upon this system with energy and vigour ; the enemy must feel , that , with the greatest part of the Continent at his feet , to the Continent he is still confined : — I llâ se jactet in aulâ Et clauso carcere regnet . He must feel , and it must be made manifest to the world , that , except by chance or stealth , he could have no communication with his foreign possessions ; not even any intercourse by sea , with the distant parts of his own European dominions : and that for all these purposes the neutral flag was not less interdicted than his own . This was a legitimate application of our naval superiority , in the preservation of which , America was not less interested than Great Britain ; and by no other means could it he effectually maintained ; it was the great barrier against the attempt of universal empire , and , if wisely exercised , might , humanly speaking , be deemed sufficient to uphold the independence and preeminence of this country against every possible combination . Still , however , those appeared to him to be shallow statesmen , who supposed that a good understanding with America was not highly important to the naval interests of Great Britain . To renew and strengthen that good understanding was the object of the noble baron 's motion , and he felt that in supporting it he was discharging his duty to his sovereign and his country ; being fully convinced that
