feelings excited in that part of it , which should be exposed to the immediate pressure of an army . If the scene of war , for instance , lay in England , and we had an army of allies , Germans or Russians , or even an army of our own countrymen , acting for our defence , they would not , he apprehended , be very popular , in the places where they were ; and there would not be wanting complaints among the farmers , whose provisions were consumed , whose henroosts were plundered , whose furniture was stole , whose ricks were set on fire , and whose wives and daughters might not always be treated with perfect decorum , that the French themselves could not do them greater mischief ! Now , if this were true , as it infallibly would be , of English troops upon English ground , might we not suppose that a good deal more of the same sort would happen , both as to the provocation given and the imitation excited by it , when English troops were to be placed in these circumstances on Spanish ground , and where every cause of dissatisfaction must be aggravated a thousand-fold , by difference of habits and manners , and the want of any common language , by which the parties might understand one another . It must be confessed , too , he was afraid , that we were not the nation who accommodated ourselves best to strangers , who knew best how to conciliate their good-will ; and when to all this were added the circumstances in which our army was placed , that we were a retreating army , and an army compelled to retreat with extraordinary rapidity and much consequent disorder , it would not be very surprizing , if neither we appeared to the people nor they to us , in form the most advantageous , 1116 or such as to render the inhabitants of the towns and villages on the line of our march , a very fair representation of the feelings and sentiments of the mass of people in Spain . On many occasions , from the fault of the commissariat , or from other causes , the soldiers , when they came in at the end of a long march , had nothing provided for them to cat ; and were obliged to help themselves . The inhabitants , in their terror , whether they staid or had tied , had locked op their houses , and nothing was to be got but by breaking then open ; and it was easy to understand , that when once soldiers , whether from necessity or otherwise , began to break open houses , further irregularities , without disparagement to the discipline of the army , or character of the men , must he expected . The kingdom of Gallicia in . general , was probably a very unfair specimen , as to what was to be looked for from the rest of the country , not so much , perhaps , from the character of the inhabitants , as from the state of society there , where the gentry were few and of little influence ; and where there was almost a total want of those classes which might direct and methodize the exertions of the lower orders , or make them sensible even that such exertions were necessary.—To talk of the Spaniards generally , as wanting in zeal or courage or determination to defend their country , was more than any one would venture , alter such examples as Saragossa ; where a defence was made so far exceeding what was to be expected from a regular army , that one might conceive a general made a peer in this country , for having surrendered Saragossa , in circumstances far short of those in which its inhabitants defended it.—The right hon . gent . concluded with expressing his determination to support the motion for an Inquiry . spoke in favour of the landing of the troops in Portugal . said that the house and
