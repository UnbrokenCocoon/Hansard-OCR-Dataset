annulling the same , whenever Rich revocation should appear expedient , — 782 That the Congress of the United States of America , alarmed at the dangers to which neutral commerce was exposed , by the said Decrees , and by the system then known to be in the contemplation of his majesty 's government , and actually carried into effect by the said Orders in Council , passed laws for laving an immediate Embargo on all American vessels and exports.—And that by the operation of such laws , all trade of export , from the said States into this kingdom or its dependencies , has been prohibited , and the commercial intercourse of his majesty 's subjects with the said States has been , in other respects , essentially impeded.—That in the month of August last , the minister of the United States , resident at this court , made to his majesty 's government an authorised and explicit offer of re-establishing the said intercourse , proposing , that if his majesty 's Orders in Council should be repealed , as far as regarded the United States , the Embargo imposed in the said States should be removed , as far as regarded his majesty 's dominions ; and adding , that if his majesty 's enemies should not rescind their Decrees , the said Embargo should be continued as with respect to them.—That this offer on the part , of the United States appears to us just in principle , and in its tendency highly advantageous to the essential interests of this country . Just , in as much as it removed all pretence of the acquiescence of the United States in the French Decrees ; which acquiescence was the only ground on which any right could accrue to his majesty to interrupt the innocent commerce of a neutral power ; and advantageous to Great Britain , inasmuch as if it should not have produced the repeal of the French Decrees ( the avowed purpose of his majesty 's Orders ) , it must have secured to this country the exclusive commerce of America , and the alliance against I a power which has become the common enemy of both.— That we believe and hope that it is still open to his majesty to renew them on the basis of this proposal ; the commercial intercourse between this country and the United States ; every interruption of which we consider as manifestly injurious to the interest of both , and particularly calculated , in the present crisis , to assist the designs of our enemies , I and to weaken our own resources — That we , therefore , most humbly pray his majesty to adopt , without delay , such measures as may best tend to the immediate ? 783 re-establishment of the commercial intercourse between his majesty 's dominions and the United States of America , and to bring , by temperate and conciliatory negociation , all other points of difference to a just and amicable conclusion.— Assuring his majesty of our firm and invariable support , in maintaining , against every Unjust aggression , and every novel claim , the ancient and essential maritime rights of his majesty 's crown . '' in delivering his sentiments upon the motion which had been submitted to their lordships , did not mean to follow his noble friend through all the topics which he had introduced into his speech ; but proposed to confine himself to that head of discussion to which their attention had been principally directed , namely , the Orders in Council . Upon the origin of the American War , which had not escaped his noble friend 's animadversion , he would refer them to some family notes upon that event , which were , he presumed , in his possession . The main object of his noble friend 's motion was to address his majesty to renew the negociation with the American government , for the purpose of adjusting the existing differences between the two countries . That it was perfectly within the competence of their lordships to resort to such a measure
