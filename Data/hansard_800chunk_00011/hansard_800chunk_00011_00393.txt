advantageous to them , and such as with tolerable good conduct , might have been made not less popular.—There was no one who would deprecate more than he should any meddling spirit of interference in their internal concerns , or any assumption of a right of control : but the existence of an authority arising from merits and services , from the value , of what was done , and the evidence of what was intended , and which should 1114 be applied only to the healing dissensions , discouraging factions , and affording a common centre of appeal to all the upright and well Mentioned , was perhaps just the happiest thing that could happen in their circumstances , and such as every honest and intelligent Spaniard must hail with delight—He could not help perceiving in the conduct of this war , and certainly in much of the language held about it , a certain mixture of that error , which , prevailed in many years of the last war , of encouraging sanguine expectations of what was to be done by Austria and other powers , and looking to them for what in many instances ought to have been our own work . Something of that sort prevailed here . With all our talk about Spain , We did not set our shoulders to the wheel , as people would , who felt that they had nothing to trust to , but their own exertions , and who estimated truly what the exertions of this country could do when fairly put forth.—But , the great and pregnant source of error in the conduct of the hon . gentlemen , besides the fault of not knowing better , was that which they had in common with many other ministers , and which he had signally witnessed in some of his own time , of mistaking bustling for activity , and supposing that they were doing a great deal , when they were only making a great deal of noise , and spending a great deal of money . While ministers were writing long dispatches , issuing orders in all directions , keeping up the clerks to unusual hours , covering the roads with messengers , and putting the whole country in a ferment , they were very apt to fancy that the public service must be making prodigious advances . And their purpose , the purpose of the ministers themselves , might , very possibly , in the mean while be answered ; for the error here stated was not a disinterested one and one without its design . It was thus , perhaps , that an administration was to acquire the character of vigour ! The ministers looked at every measure not with a view to the effect which it was to produce abroad , but to the appearance which it was to make at home : they were more intent upon the richness and costliness of the handle of their weapon than upon the keenness and temper of the blade . The public joined them heartily in the delusion ; and as long as that was so , we must expect to see the interests of the country and of the world sacrificed to such misconduct , as was exhibited in the 1115 history of this campaign in Spain.—There was another topic upon which he felt it necessary to touch . It had been represented , that throughout the North of Spain there was the greatest possible apathy and want of zeal , and that the marquis de Romana had confessed it . Now , to say nothing of the gross breach of confidence in quoting what the marquis de Romana had said , if he had said it in private , or the gross fallacy of quoting what he might have said in a proclamation in a moment of spleen or anger , and for the purpose of stimulating the inhabitants of those provinces to greater activity , he must utterly deny the expressions quoted . There could be nothing more fallacious than to estimate the feelings of a country towards any cause , by the
