, that he felt himself equally strong in the case his majesty 's government had to make out to the country with respect to the conduct of that campaign . It was far from his intention to enter into any detail of the many and signal services performed by sir John Moore , in the course of a life , though short , most active , because he felt that the faint picture his humble abilities enabled him to draw would fall infinitely short of the merits he designed to celebrate . They were sufficiently fresh in the remembrance of the house , and he should rather weaken than strengthen their claims on public gratitude , by dwelling upon them . Still , however , there were one or two points which it would be a failure in gratitude to pass by without particular notice . The 141 first point to which he would call the attention of the House , was the condition of the army on its arrival at Salamanca , after its march from Lisbon—a march which , whether they considered the extent of the country , the unusual inclemency of the season , or the arrangements necessarily resorted to , was difficult beyond description , and imposed upon sir J. Moore as arduous a task as could possibly devolve upon any commanding officer ; and yet , owing to his admirable management , never did an army appear in a state of more perfect discipline , of more complete equipment , in higher military condition , and more competent in every respect ( with the exception of numbers ) to meet and encounter an enemy , than did that army on its arrival , after a severe and fatiguing march , at Salamanca . The march by land was the option of sir John Moore , not from any deficiency of transports , but from the then efficient state of the army , and he ( lord C. ) did consider it a most judicious preference on the part of sir John Moore ; as he did not think , that an army assembled at that period in Gallicia , if conveyed by transports to the northern extremity of Spain , would have had as good an opportunity for co-operation with the natives , as it might have had on its arrival in a more central part of Spain , after its march through Portugal.—The next circumstance he should advert to was , the diversion effected by sir John Moore 's retreat in favour of the Spaniards , and never was there in the military history of any country a more complete diversion ; for he had completely succeeded in drawing to the northern extremities of the peninsula the efforts of the French forces from the track of the Spanish armies : in effecting this great diversion , sir John Moore had secured an object of not less importance , by asserting the national honour in the brilliant result of the action with Marshal Sotlt 's army . The more the circumstances of that action were examined into , the more illustrious an instance would it appear of the matchless gallantry of British troops , after suffering all the hardships of a march of unexampled severity , pressed upon continually by an army of considerably superior force , amid the rigours of a season peculiarly inclement , where human strength was exhausted by the rapidity of their movements , the consequence of forced marches , so that none but the choice troops of each army , who had surmounted all these difficulties , remained to be oppos- 142 ed to each other ; notwithstanding all these circumstances to fight a battle , and not only obtain a victory , but obtain it in a way so decisive , that they had leisure to embark every individual of their forces in the presence of a superior army , whom they had beaten the day before , and did not leave a single wounded soldier , nor one solitary piece of artillery behind them , which French artifice could convert into the slightest pretence of national exultation.—He was
