which he proffered for adoption : — `` That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty , to represent to his Majesty that we have considered with attention the various documents , incomplete as they are , which have been laid before us respecting the efforts made by his Majesty during the last campaign , in support of the resistance of the people of Spain and Portugal to the unjust aggression and usurpation of the French government.—That we feel ourselves bound to represent to his Majesty , that on the result of this examination , we have seen with mortification and grief the disgrace brought on his Majesty 's councils , and the injury sustained by the British empire from the want of information and foresight which have been evinced in every part of the conduct of his Majesty 's Ministers . That no rational plan of operations has at any time been formed by them cither for the direction of our own exertions , or for combining them with those of the Spanish and Portuguese nations ; no just view taken of the political situation of either country , nor any due attention paid to the supply of those means which alone could have enabled the British armies to act with a reasonable hope of success.—That with such proofs before us , it would not be consistent with our duty to withhold from his Majesty a declaration of our full conviction that , owing to the rashness and mismanagement of his Majesty 's Ministers , the hopes which the nation had been led to entertain have been disappointed , a large and useless expenditure of the means and resources of the country has been incurred , a great and dangerous accession of political naval and military strength has already been obtained by the enemy , and above 7,000 of his Majesty 's brave troops , together with their gallant commander , have been sacrificed without advantage in enterprize without plan , combination , or foresight , and equally ill-timed and misdirected . '' rose in reply . His lordship began by agreeing with the noble earl , that the feeling of fair confidence in the executive department of the state which had been expressed by almost every man in the country , when the first 151 prospect appeared in Spain of resistance to the aggressions of France , laid on his majesty 's ministers as heavy a responsibility as any , to which a government was perhaps ever subjected . On the part of his majesty 's ministers he was anxious to declare , that the furthest wish from their minds was to avoid inquiry into their conduct ; their only desire was , that that conduct should be fairly investigated , and that no misrepresentation of the facts should be substituted for the facts themselves . The first of these misrepresentations which he should notice was , the insinuation that his majesty 's ministers had used every means in their power to stir up the popular feeling on this subject . It must be evident to every unprejudiced mind that this was not the case , but that the popular feeling had been expressed spontaneously and consentaneously . The noble earl had censured his majesty 's government for precipitation ; he had declared it to be his opinion that they ought to have waited to ascertain the probability of the success of the cause of patriotism in Spain , before they offered the Spaniards assistance . This was a most extraordinary opinion . What ! when the feeling of resistance against oppression was so strong and so general in Spain , would it have been honourable to the British character , had his majesty 's ministers told the gallant Spaniards ; `` We will not give you aid while you are most in want of it ; while your efforts at emancipation are in infancy ; but we will defer our assistance until you are in full strength , and need it net ? '' Had such been the language held by his majesty 's ministers , they would , indeed , have deserved the reprobation of
