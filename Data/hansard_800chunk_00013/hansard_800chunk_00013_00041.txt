to the Banks of Scotland by their good sense and patriotism , to try the efficacy of a measure without precedent , while the Bank of Ireland has only to follow an example where success has been already demonstrated by experience . '' I therefore , Sir , in saying as I now do , that a common circulating medium of Bank paper may be established by the Bank of Ireland , say that which is recommended to be done by this committee , upon their finding that a similar measure had been adopted in Scotland with complete success . But , Sir , independant of these motives to induce the Bank of Ireland to make their paper convertible into Bank of England paper , their own private interests should have great weight in pointing out to them the policy of such a step ; for , if it should be attended with the consequence of preventing future fluctuations in the rates of exchange , it will relieve them , whenever the restriction of cash payments is taken off , from the expence of providing guineas to answer the great demands which are made for them whenever the exchange is unfavourable to Ireland ; and for the same reason the Bank of England is also interested in preventing fluctuations in the rates of exchange , as they are liable to similar demands upon them , whenever the exchange is unfavourable to England . If however , Sir , the Bank of Ireland should refuse to give Bank of England notes in exchange for their own on demand , or to give bills 82 on London for them as has been suggested , the currency of Bank of England paper may in a great measure be obtained in Ireland , by making it a legal tender equally and to the same extent as Bank of Ireland paper is . One effect of this regulation would be the impossibility of an exchange unfavourable to England , because no one would go to 'Change and give a premium for a bill of exchange , when he could get a bank note without a premium , which would answer every purpose of a bill in making a remittance to Ireland ; and thus one half of the business of doing away the exchange would be accomplished . But just in the degree and to the extent that Bank of England paper would be sent to Ireland for the purpose of keeping exchange favourable to England , a stock of it would be there established with which the exchange would be prevented from becoming unfavourable to Ireland ; for , as the tendency of the exchange to be unfavourable to Ireland would arise from the demand for bills on London being greater than the supply , all this stock of Bank paper would come in to the aid of the bills in meeting the demand for the means of making remittances . I can not think that it is proposing a very unreasonable thing to require that Bank of England paper should be as current in one part of the United Kingdom as in other parts , and that , if there is no objection to give it that quality in the farthest parts of England , and the most remote quarters of Scotland , now that Ireland forms one and the same country with England and Scotland , it is but removing a distinction that ought not to exist , to make it as current in Ireland.—I have now , sir , stated the several reasons that occur to me to prove the policy of assimilating the currencies of the United Kingdom , and I shall now proceed to lay before the house very good authority in support of the arguments which I have made use of . The Committee already referred to , in their report say , `` if it shall be thought expedient to equalize the currency , by making the shillings contain only twelve-pence , Your Committee submit the advantage of doing so . `` —As to the effect of an assimilated currency of bank paper , they say ,
