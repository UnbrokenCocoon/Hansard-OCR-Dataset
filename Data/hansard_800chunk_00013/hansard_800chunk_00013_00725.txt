conformity to that principle , that we resorted to substitution , when the means of importation were no longer within our power ; and , I trust , Sir , that in future , whenever our own growth of corn is insufficient for our consumption , we shall give our fellow subjects the preference over foreigners ; and , if the situation of the West India Planter requires it , that instead of importing , we shall continue to substitute . The West India Planters , are now , in their turn , contending ; for the principle , as they call it , of the monopoly of the home consumption of Great Britain ; but this principle has never been recognised to the extent to which they would push it ; for the produce of the conquered colonies has uniformly been admitted into home consumption . Even if this principle were acknowledged , it would be of no use to them in the present state of things , as I trust I shall shortly satisfy the House ; and I must say , that it is with a peculiar ill grace that they attempt to maintain prejudices of their own , at the very moment when they are reaping the most substantial advantages from having overcome the prejudices of others . The propositions which I shall endeavour to establish , are these : that the exclusion of the produce of Martinique would be of no benefit whatever to the British Planter ; that this exclusion would be highly injurious to the British Sugar Refiner ; that it would be unjust to the inhabitants of Martinique : and a violation of honour and good faith on the part of the British Government . I have already granted , Sir , that in the infancy of the British West India settlements , the monopoly of the home consumption of the mother country was a most valuable privilege of the Planter : but the advantages of this monopoly having been felt and acknowledged by our predecessors , we retain the same ideas of its importance as were justly impressed upon their minds , without adverting to the change of circumstances that has taken place since their days . For many years past , the cultivation of the British West India colonies has been so much extended , that the consumption of the mother country has been insufficient to take off their produce ; and a considerable proportion of their sugars has necessarily been re-exported . In this state of things , it is not Great Britain alone , but Europe at large , that the British Planter must consider as his market . While sugar is dear upon the Continent , it never can long continue to be cheap in Great Britain ; nor when it is cheap upon the Continent , can it long be dear in Great Britain ; for the price which the surplus will produce for exportation , regulates the price of what is sold for home consumption . If the British market is depressed below the standard of the Continental markets , the foreign buyer finds it his interest to purchase , and continues so to do as long as it will afford him a profit on exportation . When this competition ceases , as the importation exceeds the home consumption , the stock accumulates ; and as the value of every commodity depends on the proportion which the supply bears to the demand , the price falls , till it becomes the interest of the foreign buyer to purchase as before . Perhaps the action and re-action of the British and Continental markets on each other , may by best illustrated by a familiar example . Many gentlemen who hear me , have doubtless occasionally been at some of the watering places on the coast of Kent or Sussex , and may have observed , that when the fishing boats belonging to those places have a favourable wind for getting up to London , fish is very scarce and dear ; but that when the wind is contrary , and they can not get up to
