's appearance at the bar , and about forty members of the House of Commons , in his majesty 's name delivered the following Speech . rose and spoke as follows : , â€”When this bill was read for the first time , I could not help expressing my surprise , that a measure unsupported by a single precedent , and , as the language of the Bill itself admits , contrary to all the laws , customs , and usages established in similar cases , by the wisdom of our ancestors , should be recommended to parliament on the ground of an alledged expediency ; without any attempt whatever to prove that expediency being made , and without any of the parties whose interests are involved in this projected innovation , having been previously consulted . I also stated , shortly , my reasons for thinking that this measure , which I was aware had been suggested to his majesty 's ministers by the Committee of West India planters and merchants , could be productive of no possible advantage to them , while it would be highly injurious to the Sugar Refiners , and unjust to the inhabitants of Martinique , If the first of these propositions only could be maintained , it would not be a sufficient ground for rejecting this Bill ; for I know of no objection to complying even with the prejudices of any body of men provided those prejudices are innocent prejudices : but if it can be shewn , that complying with those prejudices would be injurious to the interests of others , and a violation of good faith on the part of the British nation , then I am persuaded that this Bill will no longer receive that official support from his majesty s ministers , under the sanction of which it has been presented to this house . With respect to the interests of the West India Planters , I contend , that as in consequence of the capture of the island of Martinique , the sugars of that colony must find their way to Europe , all the mischief that can be done to the British Planters by that conquest , has been done ; that it is now perfectly immaterial to them , whether these sugars are brought in neutral vessels to the foreign ports of the conti- tinent , or in British vessels to the ports of Great Britain : and in the latter case , that it is equally immaterial , whether they are brought here for exportation or home consumption . When I say that all the mischief that can be done to the British Planters has been done , I mean to cast no reflection on the policy which dictated the capture of Martinique ; for if the conquest of that colony were desirable , either as extending the carrying trade , or opening a new market for the manufactures of Great Britain ; as depriving the enemy of a cruising station , peculiarly favourable to the annoyance of our commerce by his privateers , and of the finest harbour in the West Indies , which had long served as an asylum to his flying squadrons ; as giving us possession of an important colony , on which Buonaparte probably sets more than common value , either to be retained at a peace , or restored for some valuable equivalent ; as placing within our power the patrimonial estate of Madame Buonaparte , with many of her relatives , and perhaps in consequence facilitating some arrangement , that may put an end to the captivity of our countrymen so long detained in France ; if , I say , from any of these considerations , or others which may have suggested themselves to the minds of his majesty 's ministers , they were induced to undertake this enterprize , I must admit that an object of such great national advantage , ought not to be abandoned from a regard to the interests of any particular class of individuals . But I must also contend , that , where the interests of any class of men
