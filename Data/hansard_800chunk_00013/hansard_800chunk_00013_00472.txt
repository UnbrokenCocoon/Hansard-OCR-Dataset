penalties and provisions to effect that to which the old were formerly adequate . But then this change and this necessity should be shown : and after all it is no just , conclusion , that because our ancestors wished to prevent certain things by certain means , they would therefore be willing to accomplish their object at any price , or to have recourse to any means , be they what they would , which the attainment of that object might hereafter require . Our business therefore is to ascertain , what it is right for us to do , with respect to an object , on which neither morals nor law , as antecedently established , prescribe to us any certain mode of action , nor even impose upon us the necessity of acting at all.—The acts in question are not in themselves corrupt or immoral . The law has either prescribed nothing about them , or , having prescribed what it has thought fit , has left , to say the least , the necessity of any further provisions , to the judgment of the legislature of the time.—It may be , that what it is proposed to be suppressed , is a political evil , tending to render parliament a less fit instrument for promoting the general welfare . If it is so , let us , in God 's name , set about in earnest to devise the means of suppressing it : taking care always as in other instances , that in eradicating what , is bad , we do not injure what is good , that in removing one evil we do not introduce others of far greater amount . But above all things let us be sure , that in attempting change , with all the dangers to which change is liable ; particularly in a machine so delicate , so complicated , whose movements can be so little defined , and are so imperfectly understood , as those of the British constitution ; we are not proceeding upon assumptions , which we our selves at the moment suspect to be false , 748 and which we adopt rather in compliance with the clamour of persons out of doors , than in conformity to our own sober , deliberate , and unbiassed judgment . It is in fact in deference to the former of these motives , that is to say , to the voice of what is called the public , that the adoption of the measure now proposed is principally urged , And this being the case , it is in a more especial manner incumbent upon us , to consider what is the nature of this call , by what causes it has been excited , with what circumstances it is combined , and from what classes and descriptions of persons it chiefly proceeds . It would be the height of weakness and folly in any case to adopt a great political measure , without considering something more than the mere measure itself , without looking to the light and to the left , and inquiring what consequences it was likely , or liable , to produce beyond those immediately in view . We have been told that this measure has nothing to do with the great question of Parliamentary Reform . If this be so , we have all been under a strange misconception , for , with one exception only , not a gentleman has spoken upon the measure on either side , or in any stage of its progress , who has treated the subject upon any other footing . It would in fact be the grossest perverseness or folly to consider this measure , otherwise than as arising out of the temper and fashion of the times , and out of that wild rage , which has suddenly seized us ; nobody knows why or wherefore ; for pulling to pieces the government and constitution . It is one of the small , leading steps , which it is hoped , may in time be made introductory of that purpose : one of the early
