you by costs of proceedings ; I will take you from your business and employment ; I will hold you up to the gentlemen of the county as a disloyal man , who refuse to pay your tithes , and raising an outcry against the church establishment . `` —Such a bill as would enable the clergyman and his parishioner to make a bargain for a fixed term of years , at a fixed annual rent , would relieve the clergyman from the necessity of employing a proctor to value or draw his tithe , and enable him to collect the sum stipulated to be paid in lieu of it himself ; it would do away altogether the existence of that still more odious character the tithe-farmer ; and it would relieve the parishioner from the tyranny and exaction of those most obnoxious instruments of the church—I will add , Sir , only one more proof of the mischievous and fatal consequences which flow from the present mode of collecting tithes in Ireland , and which arises from a circumstance which took place so late as in the month of last February , in the county of Kerry . In consequence of the disturbed stave of that county , great exertions were made by the gentlemen and particularly by the Catholic clergymen , to persuade the people to return to a state of tranquillity . These exertions proved successful , and at a place appointed multitudes attended , gave up their arms , and took the oath of allegiance . They declared , however , on their oaths , that the great suffering which goaded them to madness , sprung from proctorship , or the manner of collecting tithes . Of the cess itself , unconnected with clerical agents , they did not complain ; on the contrary , they distinctly declared , they felt no evil whatever when dealing solely and immediately with the clergy- 633 man.—Now , Sir , I conceive it impossible for the house , after having heard these statements , to hesitate about the expediency of adopting some measure to reform the abuses belonging to the present system of collecting tithes in Ireland.—But , Sir , though I think these are circumstances which ought to obtain for my motion the support of the house , I am free to confess that the point of view in which I am principally induced to consider the bill which I propose to introduce as a good measure , is , that of its being a measure which will very much facilitate the carrying into effect at some future day some plan for an entire commutation of Tithes , and I beg the house will dearly understand that I propose the limited measure of granting leases for Tithes , only because I see no chance now of carrying such a plan into effect , and by no means because I think that such a plan ought not now to be adopted . This in truth , sir , is the measure which the people of Ireland desire , and this is the measure which his majesty 's ministers would themselves adopt , if they could fully comprehend all the evils which flow from tithes , as affecting the public peace and security : and if they could justly appreciate all the beneficial effects which would attend a full concession to the feeling of the people of Ireland upon this subject . As a mode of levying from the people a pecuniary remuneration of the clergy , they are most objectionable ; they are a tax upon the produce of land , and not upon the surplus of the produce which is left after defraying the expences of cultivation , which last is the only fund that ought to be taxed . They are a tax also completely at variance with the maxim , that each person ought to contribute as nearly as possible in proportion to his ability.—But , Sir , if Tithes are objectionable as contrary to the true principles of taxation , and as obstacles in the way of agricultural improvement , how much more objectionable are
