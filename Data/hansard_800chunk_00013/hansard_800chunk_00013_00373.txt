cases and precedents , all occurring since the Revolution , but a great part of them since the year 1786 , for the purpose of shewing that the court of King 's Bench had exercised a discretionary and legal power in committing offenders to prison in different and distant places from the scene of the offence or the session of the court , and that it ordered up delinquents from distant parts to be tried , at its bar , and caused the infliction of punishments in different places as it deemed expedient ; and in the exercise of those powers it was always undisturbed and unquestioned ; and he dwelt upon the instance of lord Thanet 's committal to the Tower of London for an offence committed in the county of Kent , as a proof that it was not the poverty of the offender that prevented him from calling the authorities of the court intolearned counsel for the Plaintiffs upon the security required from them , and the difficulties they would labour under in consequence , he said , `` I dare say if the learned gent . 's clients were to ask him whether such and such a particular act would not incur a forfeiture , that his answer would be , ' I will not tell any man who contemplates a seditious publication , or meditates any other illegal act , how near he may go , and yet clear the law ; how near the wind he might go without endangering himself !

He contended that there was no foundation for the theory laid down by the learned gentleman ( Mr. Clifford ) on the other side , on Tuesday last , when he attempted to maintain that the court of King 's Bench had no right to execute its sentence except in a gaol of the county wherein the offence was committed , a gaol in a county where the court actually sat , or their own peculiar gaol .
