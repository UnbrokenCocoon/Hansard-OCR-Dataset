on the subject of that communication . In fact , it had been stated by that noble lord , that Marshal Soult was vanquished in three successive battles . In his opinion , our army was only engaged with the rear guard of the enemy , and not with its main body under Soult . He would wish to ask , what force on our part , would be efficient to ensure ultimate success , if not mainly , and in principle , supported by the people to whom we were giving assistance ? Within a few days , accounts had gone abroad of a second evacuation of Madrid ; but he really believed no diminution of the French force in Spain had taken place , on account of the French Emperor 's attention being called to Austria ; on the contrary , he conceived their force in that country to be much more than equal to the resistance opposed to them.—The hon . gent , remarked on the dissensions of Spain as at- 817 tended with considerable danger to its cause , and particularly adverted to the accounts lately received with respect to dissolving the Junta of Oviedo . Were we not compelled he would ask to husband our resources for the last contest we might be engaged in for the preservation of ourselves ? Whatever heart-breaking there might be in the case , upon these grounds , he felt it impossible to acquiesce in the vote so far as regarded Austria , at a time when it might happen that we should have to contend against the enemy , not in Spain or Germany , but at home.—On the subject of peace he would say , that the ways of providence were inscrutable , and that in the most desperate cases were frequently perceived the openings to safety .

To assure his majesty that this house will lose no time in taking such treaty into its most serious consideration , in the earnest hope that it may be found , that the stipulations of such treaty have been concerted with wisdom , and that the interests and existence of the Austrian empire may not have been put to increased hazard , by the adoption of rash and precipitate counsels.—To acquaint his majesty that this house sees with satisfaction , that the provisions of the treaty with the emperor of Austria , do not include any stipulation for pecuniary assistance from this country . That his faithful commons have learnt with surprise , that without any authority given on the part of his majesty , the Austrian government has thought proper to draw upon his majesty 's treasury , for certain sums of money , in aid of her warlike operations : that with whatever regret such refusal may be accompanied , his majesty 's faithful commons do 818 nevertheless feel themselves bound to refuse the payment of such bills , or to give countenance to such an unauthorised act on the part of a foreign power , which , being totally without precedent , might itself go to the establishment of a precedent of a most dangerous nature , and such as the house of commons , as guardians of the public purse , can in no way consent to sanction.—And further to acquaint
