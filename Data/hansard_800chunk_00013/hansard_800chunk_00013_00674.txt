this measure , whose arguments were never confuted , and whose talents , though successful on all other occasions , were unavailing when exerted in support of Reform . This problem , however , is easily solved , when we consider that the appeal is made to the Borough-mongers themselves , whose , interest is opposite to the measure . Their interest is different from that of the people . Having taken the Laws and the Constitution for my guide , in preparing the measure I shall have to propose , I at the same time examined attentively all those Plans for carrying the same principle into execution , which have at different times been proposed ; and having avoided all those 1053 intricacies which I considered as so many impediments in the way , have reduced it to that plain and simple form , the express image of the Constitution itself.—My Plan consists in a very few , and very simple , regulations ; and as the Disease we now labour under has been caused by the disunion of Property and Political Right , which reason , and the Constitution , say should never be separated , the Remedy I shall propose will consist in re-uniting them again . For this purpose I shall propose : — That Freeholders , Householders , and others , subject to direct Taxation in support of the Poor , the Church , and the State , be required to elect Members to serve in Parliament . That each County be subdivided according to its taxed male Population , and each subdivision required to elect one Representative . That the Votes be taken in each Parish by the Parish Officers ; and all the Elections finished in one and the same day . That the Parish Officers make the Returns to the Sheriff 's Court to be held for that purpose at stated periods . And , That Parliaments be brought back to a Constitutional Duration . The simplicity of this Plan appears from its being the true Constitution of England , which has already prepared all the means ready to our hands of carrying it into immediate effect ; and I make no hesitation in delivering it as my well-digested opinion , that under the operation of this Reform , it would be attended with much less difficulty to return a whole Parliament , than to settle a dispute at a vestry about a parish pauper . By the adoption of this Plan of Reform , those disgraceful practices , which now attend even County Elections , would be put a stop to . No bribery , perjury , drunkenness , nor riot ; no `` Wealthy Brewer , '' as was humourously described , who , disappointed of a job , takes , in consequence , `` the independent line , and bawls out against Corruption : '' no opportunity would remain , for such mock Patriotism : —no leading Attornies galloping about the country , lying , cheating , and stirring up the worst passions amongst the worst people : —no ill blood engendered between friends and relations—setting families at variance , and making each county a perpetual depository of election feads and 1054 quarrels : —No Demagogueing.—If I am a Demagogue , I am as complete a felo de se as can well be imagined—this puts an end to the occupation : —There would be an end to all odious and fanciful distinctions of persons and property—all would be simple and uniform ; their weight and influence proportioned to their intrinsic value—no qualifications nor disqualifications—no invidious exclusions by reason of any office , from the highest to the lowest , either in the Elector or the Elected—no variable , fantastical , litigious rights of voting—no possibility of false votes—no treating—no carrying out voters—no charges of any kind—no expense , legal or illegal—no contested elections.—The people would have a choice without a contest , instead of a contest without a choice ; —no sham remedies worse than the disease pretended to be cured—No Grenville Act ; here I speak feelingly ; I have undergone this remedy.—It is the remedy of a
