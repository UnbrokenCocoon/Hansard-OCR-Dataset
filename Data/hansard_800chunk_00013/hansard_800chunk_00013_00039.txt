with bank paper , and at no other expence than that of the postage of the letter containing it . The means of remittance will no longer be confined to bills of exchange ; fluctuations in the proportion which the supply of these bills bears to the demand will no longer produce fluctuations in the rates of exchange , but the funds of making remittances being the whole paper currency , the existence of an exchange must cease altogether.—If then , Sir , Bank of England paper was current in Ireland , and Bank of Ireland paper , of a given value , convertible into Bank of England paper of the same value , every person having occasion to make a remittance to London would be able to do so by sending Bank of England paper to his London correspondent : he would no longer be dependant upon the supply of bills of exchange , and he never would be under the necessity of paying a premium for the means of making his remittance . It is very easy to illustrate the accuracy of this statement by reference to the way in which matters of this kind are conducted between London and Liverpool , or any other place carrying on a great trade with London . A person in Liverpool having occasion to make a remittance to London can do so , either by a bill of exchange , or by bank paper , equally current at Liverpool and at London . If he could not obtain bank paper current at both places , then he would be compelled 79 to purchase a bill of exchange , and thus have to pay a premium or receive one , according to the quantity of bills at Change . Now , as the only difference in the relative circumstances of Liverpool and London , and Dublin and London , in regard to exchange , is that Liverpool and London have a currency of Bank paper common to both places , and that Dublin and London have not such a currency , it is plain , that if such a currency was established between Dublin and London , the existence of an exchange between these places would no more exist than it now does between Liverpool and London.—I am aware , sir , that the assimilation of the Coin of the United Kingdom may be effected without reference to the currency of Bank paper ; but , sir , as my object is to establish not only an assimilation of coin , but of the currencies as composed both of coin and Bank paper , and as I conceive that the assimilation of the coin should be accompanied with regulations , so as to secure a common currency of Bank paper , I feel that I have a right to infer from the foregoing arguments , that if the assimilation of the coin is accompanied by such regulations , the exchange will be entirely done away . I am also aware , sir , that it will , is some degree , depend upon the conduct of the Directors of the Bank of Ireland , whether or not Bank of England paper shall become current in Ireland . But though it certainly might be made so more easily by their assistance than without it , I shall presently shew , that its becoming current there does not depend altogether upon them . I have too good an opinion of the Directors of this Bank to think that , if every thing was done towards establishing a common circulating medium of paper between both countries , except what they had it in their power to do , they would so far oppose the public interest as to refuse to pay their notes with Bank of England notes , or with bills on London payable at certain fixed rates for interest and commission . I have , sir , the authority of the committee , whose Report has been read , for the practicability and policy of such an arrangement . They say , `` Other modes of obtaining a common medium , such as
