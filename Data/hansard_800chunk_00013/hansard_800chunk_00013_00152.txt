defence , to refer to transactions that would shew that such purity of motives could not easily be imputed to that noble lord . It might be urged against him as a want of candour , but he could not conceal that he did not give the noble lord much credit for purity of motives . He should still continue to watch with that jaundiced or jealous eye , which had been sometimes imputed to him , all the conduct of that noble lord ; and having caught him in one instance tripping , he should therefore jealously observe his future measures.—It had been contended , that the offence , in this instance , was not as heinous as the taking a bribe at an election : but the house would never by its vote upon the present question , sanction the opinion , that it was ready always to punish the petty offenders in retail , at the same time that it passed over this wholesale trade in corruption without animadversion . The noble lord had stated , that if the transaction had proceeded , he would have taken care that none but a proper person should be appointed . But the law does not allow any man , however proper , to be promoted for a bribe . Yet , had not the noble lord pointed out the particular political principles which his proper person was to entertain ? Had he not described the connections , and mentioned the support that was to be expected from him and them ? Would the connection of any gentleman , who , in the performance of his duty in that house , should oppose the noble lord , have been a proper person , according to his idea of such a one , as he should deem a fit object of his patronage ? It was this gross partiality in the selection of objects , and the still grosser motives that guided the selection , that he looked upon as the most dangerous circumstances in giving to any minister the unlimited disposal of the patronage they possessed . Every thing , therefore , shewed how necessary it was to pass the Resolutions of 248 the noble lord.—Some gentlemen had taken occasion , and very properly taken occasion in this discussion , to make some observations upon the necessity of a Parliamentary Reform . His own opinion upon that subject was well known , and he was convinced that nothing could tend more to shew the necessity of such a measure , than if that house should pass from these Resolutions to the orders of the day . In supporting the Resolutions , therefore , he was certainly most disinterested ; because he was most sincerely a friend to reform . He should be happy to see reform brought forward by his majesty 's ministers , because in such hands it would be productive of as much good , as would spring of mischief from the blind resistance to practical reform proceeding from any other quarter . He would particularly , therefore , rejoice to see his majesty 's ministers bring forward a plan of reform , which would come with grace from them , and be received with gratitude by the people . The opinion of the necessity of a reform in parliament was at present so general , the only difference prevailing upon the subject being only as to the precise plan , that some reform must necessarily take place . This was particularly desirable at this time , when committees of that house were every day bringing to light abuses that were concealed from view ; when the weight of the taxes were only to be equalled by the severity of their collection ; when what was granted liberally was expended prodigally ; and when there appeared no disposition to retrench or to limit unnecessary expenditure . Under such circumstances , a reform was essentially necessary , and at such a moment he regretted that any gentleman of such respectability as the hon . gent . ( Mr. Bankes ) and who had rendered such important services , too
