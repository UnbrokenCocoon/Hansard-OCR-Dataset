induced to withdraw . On putting the question at that time , he intimated his intention to bring it forward in a distinct shape , in the course of the present session . But owing to some mistake respecting the notice , and considering the advanced period of the season , as well as the very thin attendance which was likely to continue during the remainder of the session , of which the state of the house at that moment was a proof , he had changed his intention , and now proposed to move solely a Resolution , that at an early period of next session , that house would appoint a Committee to consider of the propriety of providing further limitations of the numbers of persons holding places , pensions , or sinecures , and seats in that house . To that Resolution he did not think that any opposition could be made , because , whatever might be the opinion of the right hon . gent . upon the ulterior question , as the influence of the crown in that house was now avowed , and said to be necessary , a doctrine which had never before been tolerated in that house—he thought that the right hon . gent. , from deference to public opinion , would net object to this Resolution . It was strongly impressed upon the public mind , that the influence to which he alluded was the 936 cause of all the corruptions in the state , and consequently led to the increase of the public burdens so grievously felt by all classes of the community . In deference , therefore , to the opinion of the public , the right hon . gent . would not , he trusted , make any objection to his proposition , especially as , in the next session , when the subject should be brought fully before the house , he would have an opportunity of shewing , if he could , that the influence of the crown was not so great as was supposed , or so prominent as to require any reduction.—But here he was bound to state , that in his view of the subject , the influence of the crown had increased , and ought to be diminished by those constitutional means which parliament had been in the habit , frome time to time , of resorting to for its reduction . Unless those means which by constitutional right and habitual exercise , belonged to that and the other house of parliament , should be employed to diminish the increasing influence of the crown , it would in the end overthrow the two other legislative branches of the state . A right hon . gent . opposite ( Mr. Rose ) who had studied this subject with diligence , had on a former night entered into statements , and produced tables to the house to shew , that the influence of the crown had been diminished , rather than increased , because there were fewer placemen in parliament at present than in former periods . He did not mean to stop here to inquire into the accuracy of these tables , or the justice of the right hon . gentleman 's deductions from them . Though it might be true that there were fewer placemen in that house now than formerly , that would not shew that the influence of the crown had undergone any diminution . That unobserved influence of the crown out of doors , growing out of the appointment to the various and numberless offices under the patronage of government , was alarmingly progressive , and might render it necessary to diminish the number of public officers and placemen eligible to seats in that house.—Every man who contemplated the vast accumulation of the national debt , the enormous extension of the army and navy , the correspondent augmentation of all the other public establishments , and the mass of patronage in the gross and in the detail that must necessarily arise out of such a state of things , must be convinced that the influence of the crown has
