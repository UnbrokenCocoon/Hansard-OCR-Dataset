at common law , the bill , even as it stood , would add to the punishments ; if it was not , it would create punishment to meet the offence . With respect to the question of parliamentary reform , his lordship expressed himself decidedly against the measure . He stated , that , having come into parliament in the year 1783 , and being attached to the politics of a great man , now no more , he was not inclined even to go along with that great character in the support of such a doctrine . rose and spoke as follows : Sir ; I rise to offer to the attention of the house a Plan of Reform , not for its immediate adoption , but for its future consideration—to state my opinion to the house , and the public , upon this subject , and to propose to the house to come to a Resolution ( according to a frequent custom at the close of a session ) , the object of which is , to hold out an assurance to the country , that the house will , at an early period in the next session , take into its consideration the necessity of a Reform in the State of the Representation . This course I am urged , amongst other reasons , to adopt , in order to get rid of the misrepresentation ( unintentional I am willing to believe ) which has been so long , and so actively propagated , with regard to my views and opinions on this momentous point : the mischievous tendency of which misrepresentations , as affecting myself personally , would alone have very little influence upon my mind ; but it has much , combined with the public interest . As involved in this most essential question , I therefore feel it a duty to myself and the public to relieve this subject from all misrepresentation , ambiguity , and misconception : and in now proposing for discussion , but not for immediate adoption , the outline of a specific Plan , I am answering those repeated calls which have been made upon me in this house , to state to this house , and to the public , definitely and precisely , what my views are upon the subject ( perpetually agitated ) of Parliamentary Reform , that henceforward it may be fully and clearly understood , how far I do really mean to go , and at what point I mean to stop . This is a subject which has long engaged my most anxious attention ; and though I very early stated my opinion respecting it , that opinion was not thoughtlessly formed , or rashly hazarded ; but after the most diligent inquiry , and minute investigation . If I did not then offer it to the public attention without due reflection , still less did it originate in those views and mischievous motives , to which it has been falsely ascribed—a desire to excite discontent , and to agitate the public mind by exaggerated statements of undefined grievances , beyond the reach of practical constitutional redress . I am ready to admit , if such were the case , that my conduct would be as culpable as those 1042 who most misrepresent it , would wish it to be considered ; and I am willing to confess , that to excite discontent in the public mind by fixing its eye upon necessary and unavoidable evils , beyond the power of remedy , would be as exceptionable and dishonest a proceeding , as to mislead them from their true remedy , and obstinately to withhold that easy redress which the Constitution so clearly points out , and so amply affords . In this case , I shall cautiously abstain from any exaggeration of public grievance , or any expression calculated to excite in any gentlemen , or set of gentlemen , the slightest irritation , or asperity of feeling ; it being my wish , that the question should stand on its own merits , that it should be coolly and candidly considered
