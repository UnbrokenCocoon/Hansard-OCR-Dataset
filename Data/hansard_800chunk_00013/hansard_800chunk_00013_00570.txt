appearance of being spared the pressure of additional burthens ; whereas the effect of the transfer was to render those perpetual , which would otherwise have ceased with the war , and to create the necessity of borrowing an additional million , the interest of which must be provided for by fresh taxes . To parliament the measure could not be deemed respectful , inasmuch as , without an alledged necessity , it was a departure from a system which the legislature had deliberately sanctioned , and approved ; to the country it was degrading , as it either called in question its means and resources , or the good sense , the spirit , and firmness of the people ; but above all , it was most mischievous in its tendency , as it could not fail to animate the hopes , and encourage the perseverance of the enemy , to whom it would be obvious that such a spendthrift policy must necessarily tend to limit the duration of our exertions ; and that , although our fleets and armies should be every where triumphant , all their victories might be ultimately unavailing , and compromise and submission rendered unavoidable , by the prodigality and improvidence of our government . This , he trusted , would never be our condition ; but to avert such a staff of calamity , and disgrace , it was necessary that the vigilance of parliament should be roused , and its authority exerted . Some of their lordships might not perhaps have fully ascertained the advantageous effects of that system , which was now for the first time invaded : they might not he aware , that the war taxes had not only occasioned the facilities in all money transactions , which the state of public credit ( as far as it was benefited by the comparatively small amount of our loans ) could not fail to produce , but that since the renewal of the war , they had , upon the lowest computation , prevented an addition of more than two hundred millions of debt , and of near ten millions of permanent taxes.—This was the system 910 in which a breach had been improvidently made ; he trusted it would be repaired ; or at least that the attention of parliament and the public being awakened , 'his delusive , weak , and ruinous expedient would not be repeated . He wished not to check or discourage exertion : but he was anxious to see œconomy go hand in hand with vigour , and our income and expenditure brought as nearly as possible to a level with each other.—His lordship concluded by saying that in thus delivering his sentiments , he had discharged an indispensable duty not only to his country , but to himself ; as his silence might have been misconstrued into an acquiescence in a measure , utterly inconsistent with a just view of our actual situation , and of the nature of the present contest , and directly adverse to opinions , which he had always entertained , and upon which he had constantly acted . If persisted in , it had an obvious tendency to lay us at the feet of the enemy ; although , humanly speaking , the means and resources we possessed , were , if wisely applied , fully sufficient to frustrate all his projects for our destruction , and to conduct us through the struggle , not only with security to our independence , but with increased glory , and augmented power . To a measure of such a description he could not but express his decided , and unqualified dissent . contended that the noble viscount was in error , in supposing that the annual expenditure during the probable continuance of the war could be limited to any definite sum . This , from the unavoidable fluctuation of circumstances and the varying price of all articles necessary to our numerous and diversified equipments , was actually impossible . He regretted as much as the noble viscount , the great increase of our expenditure , but it should be recollected
