our enemies . The real value of British Manufactures exported in 1802 , was about 48,300,000l. , and in 1808 somewhat less than 41,000,000l. , being a diminution of about seven millions and a half : Yet , there is reason to believe , that upon a 1135 comparison of two periods of six years , the export of our Manufactures has considerably increased , for the Official Value of British Manufactures exported on an average of six years , ending with 1802 , was something short of 23,000,000l. , and in a like average ending 1808 , somewhat exceeded 25,000,000l . In the exclusion of our Colonial Produce , the enemy appears to have been more successful , for the Official value of Foreign Merchandise exported from Great Britain in 1802 , was 14,418,837l . and in 1808 , 7,398,803l . Comparing the two periods , as before , the diminution , though smaller , is still considerable ; on an average of six years , ending 1802 , the export of Foreign Merchandise was in Official Value about 11,650,000l . and in an average of three years , ending 1808 , about 8,430,000l . and in this case , the Real Values do not very materially differ from the Official . And here it is with peculiar pleasure , that I turn to the Irish part of the account , and find the Commerce of that important and interesting part of the Empire in a state of progressive improvement . The Official Value of all Imports into Ireland , in the year 1802 , was 6,687,741l . Irish Currency , and in 1808 , 7,129,507l . ; The Official Value of Irish Produce , and Manufactures exported in 1802 , was 4,876,070l. , and in 1808 , 5,696,897l . The increase of Real Value was still much greater : In 1802 it was about 8,300,000l. , and in 1808 above 12,500,000l . ; being an increase of more than one third in the course of six years of a burdensome and expensive War . I must here observe , that it had been my wish to frame these Resolutions in such a manner as to give a view of the Trade between Great Britain and Ireland , intirely distinct from the Foreign Trade of the Empire ; but , that the present state of the Accounts upon your table has not enabled me to do so . I hope , however , early in the next Session to move for such Accounts as will remove this difficulty in future . The next part of the Resolutions to which I mean to direct the attention of the House , is that which respects the Unfunded Debt , reserving some remarks on the State of the Funded Debt , as connected with other considerations . The amount of Unfunded Debt in Exchequer Bills , unprovided for , which on the 5th of January 1803 amounted to 9,800,000l. , has been so much encreased 1136 by successive Issues , that at the close of the present year it will amount to 27,000,000l . Large as this sum may appear , and burdensome as it might prove in case of any depression of public credit , I am by no means disposed to complain of its amount . It seems to me justified by the present abundance of capital in the country , and the high credit of public securities , which have lately enabled the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reduce the rate of Interest on Exchequer Bills , a circumstance highly satisfactory , and on which I sincerely congratulate him and the Public . But the point of view in which I now wish to bring this great increase of Exchequer Bills under the notice of the House , is that of its being in operation and effect , an evasion of the Sinking Fund Act of 1792 . It was unquestionably the intention of Mr. Pitt , in proposing that Act , and of Parliament in sanctioning it , that every augmentation of public debt ( except anticipations to be repaid in a short time ) should carry with
