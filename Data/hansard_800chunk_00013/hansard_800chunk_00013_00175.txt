in a variety of instances ; amongst others in giving effect to a decree for confiscating the property of absentees from Portugal , and issuing a circular letter to the ministers of the prince regent at the several courts of Europe , directing them to discontinue their diplomatic functions . With such information respecting the conduct of the regency , it was not possible the Portuguese minister in London could sanction the appointment of any of the persons composing it , as a part of a provisional government ; and as the circumstances alluded to were known to every merchant connected with Portugal , his majesty 's ministers can not be supposed to have been ignorant upon the subject . It has , indeed , been admitted by his majesty 's ministers that instructions were issued to sir Hew Dalrymple to reinstate the regency ; and although he excluded three out of the five obnoxious persons , yet as the remaining two were actually included , it was not surprizing that when the people saw the whole power of the government vested in those persons , that they should be alarmed and disgusted ( as neither the bishop of Oporto , nor the count Monteiro Mor would act with them ) . Indeed , his lordship said , the conduct of this regency , immediately upon their appointment , was such as could not fail to excite suspicion and distrust . It was perfectly well known that one of the chief defects in the Portuguese army was the inadequacy of its establishment in point of pay . In order to remedy that defect , the Junta of Oporto , by an ordinance promulgated for that purpose , had raised the pay of the infantry soldiers to five pence per 285 day . The effect of this judicious measure was , that , in less than one month after its adoption , upwards of twenty thousand men were enrolled under the orders of that Junta , and were fast approaching to a state of discipline that would soon have rendered them fit for the discharge of any duties they might be called upon to perform . The first act of the newly appointed regency was to rescind this ordinance , and the consequences of it were desertion to a very great extent , and a degree of insubordination amongst the troops and the people , that nothing but the personal influence which the bishop still retained , could have prevented from producing the most fatal effects ; and although by his exertions tranquillity was restored , the zeal of the people was damped , the seeds of distrust and suspicion were disseminated , all hope of confidence in the government was destroyed , and whilst the means by which they had expected to have been able to defend themselves against the French were thus interrupted , they saw that `` British aid and assistance , '' upon which they had been called upon by sir Charles Cotton to rely , withdrawn from them , and their country left exposed to the return of the French , if it should suit the purposes of Buonaparté to repossess it . In such a state of things lord Buckinghamshire said it could not be a matter of surprise to any man , that when on the 11th of December the country was by proclamation called upon to arm , the Portuguese levies should have been found in a less forward state than at the end of July , and that all hope of effectual resistance to the French should appear to have been abandoned.—Were it necessary to adduce proof of the unfortunate state of insubordination and distrust at which the Portuguese people and army had arrived , it would be found in the murder of their general Bernardin Freise , and several other officers , upon the approach of the enemy ; and the loss of Oporto , the city and seaport next in consideration and importance to that of Lisbon . Speaking of that event general Beresford in his order of the 4th of April , says , `` On the 26th the
