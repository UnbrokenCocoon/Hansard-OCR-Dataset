it might have been enabled , in concert with our ally , to act with effect in the common cause . `` That it appears to this house , that no proper measures were taken , either by his majesty 's government , or by his majesty 's minister in Spain , for enabling the Commander in-Chief of his majesty 's forces in that country to combine his operations with those of the Spanish nation ; or for furnishing him with the necessary advice and information respecting the number , situation , and movements , either of the French or Spanish armies . `` That it appears to this house , that the loss of the Spanish fleet in Ferrol , and the addition made thereby to the naval power of the enemy , is , in great part , to be ascribed to want of foresight in his majesty 's ministers , and to their neglect in not taking measures of timely precaution . `` That this house , deeply lamenting the disastrous issue of the late campaign , is of opinion , that by the neglect , improvidence , and rashness , of his majesty 's ministers , the hopes of the nation have been disappointed , the means and resources of the country have been wasted , and above 7,000 of his majesty 's brave troops , together with their distinguished Commander , have been sacrificed in an enterprise , un- 454 dertaken without that combination and foresight which the nature of the service so manifestly required , and without which no reasonable expectation could be entertained of ultimate success . '' rose to reply , and observed , that if any complaint could be made by his majesty 's ministers against the noble lord , it certainly could not be for the manner in which he had conducted the attack he had this night made , except indeed for the generality with which he had conducted that attack , accusing them of the want of all that ability , that foresight and vigour , for which his lordship 's colleagues were so eminently conspicuous during the period they were in office . Certainly , his majesty 's ministers stood in need rather of excuse than apology , on account of the extent and range of information which they had afforded for the purpose of the present investigation ; but they considered that , upon a cause so grave and interesting , it was impossible they could stand right with the country , if the principles upon which they had acted were not fully explained : and if they did not put parliament and the country in possession of all the facts of the case ; if they did not meet boldly all that ingenuity could suggest against them , and justify their conduct as far as the complicated nature of the transactions could admit of ; transactions , upon which he could not but consider the attack just now made , the most futile , vain , and unfounded that ever was attempted . The noble lord appeared to him to have adopted , not only various , but some not very consistent grounds , upon which to form that attack ; in the first place , he complained of their acting without that due and necessary information which would justify their proceedings ; and he therefore contended that they were answerable for all the consequences that had followed , and that they ought rather to have waited for such knowledge and details of circumstances , as would have guided them successfully in their subsequent proceedings . But if ministers had waited in a state of inactivity until they had obtained that full knowledge , deemed so requisite , this would have afforded a well-grounded charge of the most culpable tardiness on their part ; for how could anyone suppose they could act with any effect under such a system ? â€”It was made another ground of attack , that ministers had not sent out any 455 plan upon which our operations were to be conducted . Upon this subject , he could not conceive any
