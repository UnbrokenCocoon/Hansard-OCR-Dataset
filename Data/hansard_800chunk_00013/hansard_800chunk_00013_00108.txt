must state what they had said as to the accusation against Mr. Wakefield of having abused the indulgence granted him , by exciting sedition in the gaol . He could not of course , pledge himself for the correctness of their assertions : but he was informed by them , that no complaint had ever been made by the magistrates on that head.â€”With regard to the method of striking the Special Juries and other practices said to prevail in the courts , he could say nothing of his own knowledge . But he did understand that improper practices had prevailed , and that there was some danger that the error might be fallen into of rendering punishment so severe as to convert the person punished into an object of compassion . On the subject of the sentence passed on the Petitioner , however , he would say nothing at present , because the subject had been carried before the house of lords by a writ of error . It would be proper to wait for the issue of that proceeding , unless some unreasonable delay took place . But , with regard to the mode in which Special Juries were struck , he must advert to that point , without meaning to assert positively what he did not know of his own knowledge , and was not ready with proof to substantiate . He was informed that the master of the Crown Office might pass over any name that he pleased by saying that such persons would not attend , a practice which placed it in his power to appoint any Jury he chose . If that practice did actually prevail , it was a most incorrect one , and ought to be prevented . Another practice which he was given to understand actually prevailed , or had only lately been abolished , was , that in cases between the crown and the subject , the Jury if they found a verdict for the crown had two guineas , whereas if they found a verdict for the subject they had only one gainea . This was a most indecent and improper practice , which ought to be abolished if it existed ; if it 184 did not , the public ought to he satisfied of that fact . Another practice of which he was also informed was , that Jurors if they gave verdicts for the crown were summoned over and over again ; but if they found for the subject they were never again summoned . Another practice , which he could only state from information , was , that the crown always paid double fees to the officers of the Court . If this was not true , it would of course be contradicted . But as the circumstance was at any rate believed by some , it ought to be stated , if only in order to be contradicted . He stated them besides because they might possibly , at some future period be the subject of a motion in reference to this business of Mr. White . If these things should turn out to be well founded , this would form the ground of a motion for referring the Petition to a committee ; if there was really no grievance in the case , he should be content with allowing the Petition to lie on the table . There was another circumstance which he ought to have noticed before , the confinement in a distant gaol . This was a great aggravation of the sentence ; and if it might be imposed at the discretion of the court formed a grievous hardship . Confinement for three years was at best a most heavy punishment ; but when it was aggravated by sending the prisoner to a distant gaol , the punishment , in his opinion , became severe in the extreme ; and it was certainly a subject which deserved the most serious attention of the house . said that he would take his full share in endeavouring to remedy any improper practices , whether confinement in distant gaols or any others , which should be
