paid off to the disposal of parliament . This would nearly fix the limits of taxation during war , as no more would be required from that source , than the comparatively small charge , under the provisions of the Act of 1792 , of one per cent . on the loan for the service of the year . Thus would the people find an immediate reward for their privations and sacrifices , in the accomplishment of the important object , of having enabled their country to maintain the great contest in which it was engaged , with a diminishing debt , and with little or no addition to the public burthens . The arrival however at this splendid and impregnable situation of financial security , 908 which he was firmly convinced might have been attained , had , to say the least , been unfortunately retarded by the great increase of expenditure , which took place after the period , to which he had particularly referred . The amount of the loan for the year 1805 was twenty millions , and the addition made at that time to the war taxes , consisted of 1Â½ per cent . on the property tax , which addition was not taken at more than 1,140,000l . This provision was so inadequate to the increase of the expenditure , that the noble lords who succeeded to the offices of First Lord of the Treasury , and Chancellor of the Exchequer , in 1806 , had the wisdom and fortitude to propose an immediate addition to the war taxes of near six millions ; but , after having successfully laboured to reduce the public expenses , ( and those who know the difference between prevention and retrenchment would not be surprised that the reduction was not greater , they found the amount still so large , and the pressure of taxes recently imposed so burthensome , as to afford them no hope of carrying into full effect the system , which had been adopted at the commencement of the war . The plan however to which they had recourse , appeared to be the best that circumstances would admit of , and it was marked by the decided approbation of parliament and the public . According to this plan the expenditure of each year , exclusive of subsidies , being estimated at thirty two millions , beyond the surplus of the consolidated fund , and the produce of the annual taxes , the war taxes , which were computed at twenty one millions , were to supply not only the interest , but a sinking fund , for the loan of each year , the capital of which would , at any probable price of stocks , be redeemed within fourteen years . Without entering further into the particulars of this plan , he would observe , that it contained principles of the utmost importance , of which the project of the present year was wholly destitute ; he meant those of redemption , renovation , and permanency : that it was founded upon a correct view of the nature of the contest in which we were engaged , as it derived from the concurrent aid of the sinking fund , and the war taxes , the means of carrying it on for an indefinite period , upon the scale of expense that had been stated , without any permanent increase of debt , or any immediate addition to the permanent taxes , and with a comparatively small addition to them at a future period : 909 and that the conduct of those by whom it had been brought forward afforded a striking and creditable contrast to that of his majesty 's present ministers , inasmuch as the former had considerably diminished the public expenditure , and increased the income , and the latter had diminished the income , and enormously increased the expenditure . He must also observe , that by the transfer of war taxes from their destined purpose to that of defraying the interest of the loan , the people were deluded into a disregard of a profuse expenditure by the
