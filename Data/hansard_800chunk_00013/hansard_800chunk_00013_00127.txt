take the trouble to shew that there was some ground of distinction in this respect between the noble lord and the Directors ; for if no such difference appears , then I must charge the noble lord with having directly violated the law for disposing of patronage at the India house , and what is worse , with having betrayed some other person into something little short of the breach of a solemn declaration upon oath . The following are the words of the declaration made by a Director upon recommending for a Writership : ' I do most solemnly declare that I 'have given the nomination to , 'and that I neither have received myself , 'nor am to receive , nor has any other per son , to the best of my knowledge or be lief , received , nor is to receive , any pe cuniary consideration , nor any thing con vertible in any mode into a pecuniary 'benefit on this account . ' In page 7 , of the Report of the Committee , it appears that the attention both of the legislature and of the East India Company had , at various periods , been attracted to abuses which were supposed to exist in the disposal of their patronage , in consequence of which , at the time when their charter was renewed , an oath was framed to be taken by each Director , within ten days after his election , containing , among other engagements , the following : ' I do swear that I 'will not , directly nor indirectly , accept 'or take any perquisite , emolument , fee , 'present , or reward , upon any account 'whatsoever , or any promise or engage ment for any , or in respect of tile appoint ment or nomination of any person or per sons to any place of office in the gift or 'appointment of the said Company , or of 'me as a Director thereof'—In the Bye 212 Laws of the East India Company , ch . 6 , sect . 5 , a penalty is imposed on every Director taking any reward on account of any appointment , in double the amount of such reward , two thirds of which are to go to the Company , and one-third to the informer ; and such Director is rendered incapable of holding any place whatever under the Company . Now , sir , I contend , that the above regulations are as much in force against the patronage of the noble lord , as President of the Board of Controul , which , I insist , he had no right to dispose of , as they could possibly be in regard to the patronage of Directors . What , then , will the house think of this attack on its purity and disregard of its constitution and of its rules , when they see that the high and important office which the noble lord has held so long , has been made an instrument for the worst of purposes ; and that , directly in the teeth of an act of parliament , as well as of a Bye Law of the East India Company ? If , then , the noble lord had not the right of patronage vested in himself , as I believe , in what a situation would the delegate have been placed , through whom lord Clancarty 's writership was to be obtained ? I shall be glad to hear the noble lord 's explanation upon this subject . My opinion is , that the noble lord 's patronage is subject to the same regulation as that which affects the Directors : but I shall attend to what the noble lord has to say . If , however , he does not satisfy the house as to this point , it must serve only to aggravate the general indignation prevailing against him , and give to the whole tenor of his conduct in this transaction a still more objectionable character.—I have said before , that I should be sorry to mention names , if
