, in cases where their assignees were claimants , proposed an amendment , to provide that bankrupts were not to be allowed to be admitted as witnesses under this act , but in such cases wherein they may by law be competent witnesses before the passing of this act.—The effect of this amendment was to allow bankrupts to be witnesses upon releasing their interest in the particular matter in issue , without a general release of their allowances upon the other property assigned under the commission . A long discussion ensued both on the clause and the amendment , in which the Attorney and Solicitor General , and Mr. Davies Giddy , expressed strong doubts of the propriety of making any inroad upon the law and rules of evidence as they exist at this moment ; and sir Samuel Romilly , Mr. Stephen , Mr. Jacob , Mr. Morris , and sir Charles Price , argued , in substance , that it was desirable to adopt the clause thus amended , in order to do away the practice of giving nominal releases by fictitious instruments which were afterwards to be concealed , and to prevent , if the release were real , the bankrupt from being obliged to give all he would in that 97 case possess in the world , for the purpose of becoming a competent witness . The amendment was , however , in the end agreed to , and the clause so amended retained as a part of the bill.—On the clause for requiring creditors to release all right of action , on proving their debt under a commission of bankruptcy , the Attorney General stated that he had some objections to this clause , but should wave them , as he understood that his hon . and learned friend intended to obviate them by a clause , which would provide against a creditor 's releasing his right of action against a third party , where he had such right , as well as such bankrupt , and to prevent the creditor from releasing his right of action against the future effects of a bankrupt , whose dividends under a second commission of bankruptcy should not amount to fifteen shillings in the pound.—On the clause for authorizing the Lord Chancellor , or the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal , for the time being , to direct notices , other than personal notices , to be served upon creditors in England and Ireland reciprocally , upon appeals by petition on the part of a bankrupt , to whom his creditors should after two years continue to refuse his certificate , a member took some trifling objections , which , after a few observations from sir Samuel Romilly and the Solicitor General , were over-ruled , sir Samuel Romilly having previously stated his intention to bring in a clause , after the bill should be gone through , providing that in all such cases such other notice should under English commissions be given in the Dublin Gazette to Irish creditors , and under Irish commissions of bankruptcy to English creditors in the London Gazette.—On the clause giving to the Lord Chancellor or the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal , the power to grant a certificate on such appeal by the bankrupt , if the certificate should appear to have been withheld by the creditors from improper motives , another long discussion took place , the Attorney General and Mr. Jacob contending that it was more fit that the power of granting or withholding the certificate should be vested in the creditors or in some proportion of them , than in any other tribunal , because the creditors must be the best judges whether the bankruptcy was fraudulent , though it might not at all times be in their power to prove the grounds upon which they were of this opinion , on an appeal by the bankrupt 98 to the Chancellor . Whilst , on the other hand , it was most strenuously contended by Mr. Abercromby , that this was the most beneficial clause in the bill , because no certificate would be granted upon
