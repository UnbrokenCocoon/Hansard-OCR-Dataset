Mr. White , and he was surprised it was permitted , as justice seemed to say decidedly , that for the same offence there should be the same measure of punishment . He would not say whether he should bring forward any motion on the subject till the question in the house of lords was determined ; but he hoped that in the mean time those who had it in their power would take care that justice should be fairly dispensed . In allusion to what had fallen from an hon . friend of his on the other side of the house , that he was surprised he would present a petition from persons who were of that description , viz . libellers , his answer to this was , he thought that a strong reason why he should bring it up ; for obnoxious persons were generally those seized on by the executive government , and were the means by which such proceedings creep 191 into practice , and which might afterwards become detrimental and injurious to the subjects in the general.â€” requested the attention of the house to the few observations he had to submit to their consideration , previous to his bringing forward the motion of which he had given notice . The Bill which it was his intention to move for leave to bring in , was , word for word , the same as that which had already twice passed that house , but which had as often been rejected by the house of lords , on the ground of its being desirable that the business should be further considered . This question had already received the most ample investigation and discussion . The measure , his lordship observed , which he recommended Was no object originating in his own legislative views , it grew out of two Reports of that house , and was the first practical act recommended for adoption by two successive committees appointed by that house . In that house it had been on former occasions received without a dissentient voice ; even the king 's ministers did not feel it either justifiable or politic to interfere with it in its passage through that house . But an opposition formidable in its means and persevering in its hostility appeared in another branch of the legislature , and was for a time successful , not only against the unanimous feeling of that house , but also against the general and expressive voice of the country . The principle of the measure , after some modifications , had however at length passed that house , meeting in its progress considerable opposition in a quarter were one should suppose every duty to the country and every regard to personal dignity forbade intrusion . The opposition that was there exerted , was a question of no easy solution , but the protest which was subsequently affixed upon the Journals of that house , held no inconsiderable rank amongst the follies of princes either of past or present times . For that extraordinary record of human ingenuity he could not assign any rational motive , and for that best of all reasons that no rational cause was assignable . Every man who venerated the throne and loved the constitution , saw with pain the names affixed to that protest ( alluding to the signatures of the Dukes of York , Cumberland and Cambridge to the protest against the present Reversion Act ) . That 192 feeling , however painful , was considerably alleviated by the consideration that the prince nearest to the throne , and first in the public estimation and hopes , had too great a knowledge of the interests , and too strong an affection for the constitution of his country , to commit his character and his principles by giving his august signature to such a record . The nature of the Bill he meant to propose was perfectly well known to the house : for the value of it he would refer them to the third Report of the Committee of Finance . As to any objection that might be made to
