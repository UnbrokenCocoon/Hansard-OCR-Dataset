interests of the public ; and that all those , not being persons in office , with whom the government must occasionally have dealings , have no consideration , but how to make the most they can , and to cheat the public by every means in their power ? I should be glad to know , how many of these arraigners of the profusion of the government , if they had a piece of land to sell in the neighbourhood of a barrack or military hospital , would limit the price they asked by any other consideration , than what they thought the necessity of the case would compel government to give , or would scruple , if they saw any prospect of success , to bribe the barrack master , or other officer , to betray his trust , and contribute to give effect to their exactions . It is , in the first place , perfect folly to talk as if the parliament and the government , the parliament ( being a body that neither in fact nor theory can know any thing of the matter , and the government consisting of some ten or twenty persons , the members of the cabinet , and a few of the heads of great departments ) can be responsible for the individual conduct of the thousands and thousands of subordinate officers and agents , who must be employed in the public service , and who are distributed , far and near , through all parts of a widely extended empire : to say nothing of the fact , that the greater part of these are obtruded or palmed upon the government , by persons not being 762 themselves in any office , but in the strictest sense a part of the people , and who are thinking of nothing but to serve , by whatever means , their own friends and relations . In the next place , these frauds committed by persons within the pale of the government are for the most part of a sort , that imply a confederate without . Like other acts which are sometimes blameable , but which , in the nature of things , can not be dispensed with , they require of necessity two parties . If the exciseman connives at the frauds of the brewer or the distiller , it is the distiller and brewer by whom he is bribed to do so . If the custom-house officer permits false entries , and allows goods to be imported or exported without the proper duties , and thereby affords an example of an abuse committed , ( if any one chuse so to describe it , ) by one of the government , meaning a customhouse officer , what are we to say of the merchant or trader , by whose bribe he has been induced to do this ? who , it can not be disputed , is one of the people and one of the people merely , and very possibly , with the distiller , brewer , or tea-dealer , one of those who think that the country can never thrive , till a radical reform shall have put an end to abuses . The fact is , that when the matter comes to be searched to the bottom , it is the people throughout , who are cheating the people ; the people individually cheating the people collectively , and then finding in their own frauds and knaveries a reason for tearing to pieces the government . How is government a party to these frauds ? Even in respect to patronage , the part in which the government , properly so called , will be found most to offend , it is not ascribing much to persons , at the head of departments , to suppose , that when their own immediate connections and dependents are satisfied , they would be willing to promote good men rather than bad , if they were not controlled and compelled by the insatiable demands of those , whom they can not disoblige without renouncing the means of carrying on the
