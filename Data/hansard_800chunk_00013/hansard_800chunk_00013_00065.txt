disadvantages with which the alteration would be attended , would not greatly outweigh the advantages to be expected from it ? There were also a certain description of patent offices granted for life , with the privilege of disposing of other offices connected therewith . These he had also omitted out of the bill , as for them too , if the sale was to be prevented , an equivalent must also be given . He did not believe the advantages to be derived from introducing these into the bill would at all equal the disadvantages attending it.â€”There was only one other point in the noble lord 's speech to which he felt it necessary for him to advert , namely , that no provision had been introduced into the bill 118 to prevent the trafficing for Seats in that house . This question , he presumed to think , would come more properly to be considered in another stage of the bill , and if the noble lord would bring forward his proposition in that stage , he ( Mr. Perceval ) would consider if the provision was capable of being applied effectually to prevent the abuse of which the noble lord complained . The hon . gent . who spoke last had borne testimony , not only to his belief , but also to his knowledge , of the abuses alluded to by the noble lord , declaring that the practice of these abuses was common to all administrations . As that hon . gent . had particularly referred to an administration with which he himself was connected , it was natural to suppose that he had special knowledge and information on this head , particularly so far as that administration was concerned . He ( Mr. Perceval ) however , did not recollect that the hon . gent. , when a particular charge was brought forward on this subject against that administration , had told the house all that he had the means and knowledge of observing on this subject , because , if he had , that would have been something confirmatory of the charge , and would have tended to elucidate the truth or falsity of the statement of the then Secretary of the Treasury , that what he had done , and the influence he had exerted , had been used by him , not in his official situation of Secretary to the Treasury , but in his private character of a freeholder of Hampshire . If the hon . gent . was then in possession of all this information , belief , and knowledge on the subject , why did he not appeal to the house then , as well as on any other occasion ? Why did not his patriotism then actuate him , as it did on the present moment , to divulge every thing which he knew ? To the general inquiry he should oppose himself as decidedly as he did on the former day . But let the hon . gent . only bring forward those circumstances to which he alluded , as consisting with his own knowledge ; let him do so impartially , not forgetting the practices of the administration with which he himself was connected , and with which , of course , he must be most intimately acquainted , and the house would know how to deal with them . He again declared that he was ready to receive and to attend to all the suggestions of the noble lord , as well connected with trafficing for seats in that house , as for offices . , in explanation , said , that 119 what he had stated was not as a charge against any particular administration , but a mere matter of fact . The knowledge which he spoke of by no means proceeded from any confidence which had been reposed in him by his friends . said , he was so well pleased with part of what had fallen from a right hon . gent . ( Mr. Perceval , ) that he should say the less on that part to which he
