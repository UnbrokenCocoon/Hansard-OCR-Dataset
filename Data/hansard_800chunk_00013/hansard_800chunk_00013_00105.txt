strong , in giving the opinion and direction of the Judge as warranted by the Act of Parliament above alluded to , without the addition of the following unprecedented expression : — '' But , really , gentlemen , I think it will be throwing dust in your eyes if I say I entertain the least doubt on the subject . `` —Your Petitioner humbly submits , whether an opinion and direction of the Judge thus given , and that without having read a tittle of the Libels in question , or the defence that had been urged to the Jury , comes within the meaning either of the letter of the law , or the spirit of the British constitution . And the necessity of a Jury being peers among themselves as well as peers to the defendant , has been ever recognized and insisted upon by the British constitution , 179 because , otherwise , the master and the servant , the creditor and the debtor , the employer and employed , might be inclosed in the same Jury box , in which case it would imply an absurdity to assert that such Jury were peers among themselves ; for , the same individuals could not at the same time be both dependants and equals ; and , if a Jury be not peers among themselves , they can not all be peers to the defendant , and their verdict may not be a free and unbiassed verdict . `` And forasmuch as it is enacted by the Bill of Rights that `` Jurors ought to be duly empannelled and returned ; '' and as no Juror can be duly returned who is not summoned six days at least before the day of trial , the Jurors summoned not four days before the trial of your Petitioner , were not duly returned . `` And forasmuch as it is the privilege of the citizens of the city of London to be tried and adjudged within the said city , though your Petitioner has been tried ( if the issue committed to a Jury not duly impannelled and returned can be called a trial ) , yet he has not been adjudged within the said city , contrary to the privileges of the citizens of the said city , and , therefore , such judgment being contrary to these privileges , is contrary to the law of the land , which has confirmed and established them . `` And forasmuch as your Petitioner , if adjudged within the said city , could only have been adjudged to confinement within the prisons of the Sheriffs of the said city and county of Middlesex , it follows that a judgment which implies banishment from the said city , as well as confinement , is contrary to the lawful privileges of the citizens of the city , and when pronounced on a citizen in a place without the said city , for an alleged offence committed within the said city , is believed to be a violation of the law of the land , which acknowledges and confirms these privileges . `` Your Petitioner also humbly craves leave to observe that the measure of punishment assigned to him for the publication of the said Letters is equal to the measure of punishment assigned in any case where the libel was proved to be false , though the truth of the publications of your Petitioner has never been called in question . `` Your Petitioner also humbly states , that , when he was removed from the prison of the court of King's-Bench to the county 180 gaol of Dorchester , he was consigned to the magistrates ' custody , as will appear from an Older of Sessions , made at the Midsummer quarter sessions for the county of Dorset , respecting his treatment in confinement , though by the law of the land , he could only be committed to the Sheriffs ' custody , ( allowing for the sake of argument , that he might be imprisoned in a different county from that in which the offence was committed , and
