The sum therefore that is necessary to be provided is that which will be equal to the payment of the interest on that Loan , 678 which , with the Sinking Fund , will amount to 264,000l . or as nearly as can be calculated in a round sum , 212,800l . Towards raising that sum , I shall first state a measure that has been already under the consideration of this house , I mean the prohibition of the use of raw corn in breweries , which I estimate will add to the revenue 248,000l . ; but as it will only operate for one half of the present year , I shall only take it at 124,000l . The reason I state it at this particular sum is , that the quantity of malt used has only produced one-fourth of the number of barrels that formerly paid duty , being 504,000 barrels only . We have no certain data to go upon , but we have what will be a good foundation for forming a pretty correct judgment upon it.—Supposing that nothing but hops has been used as an ingredient , I reckon that the whole of the hops in Ireland would produce such a number of barrels as would yield annually 248,000l . ; but as it can only operate for six months , I estimate , the sum arising from this prohibition of the use of raw corn in brewing , at 124,000l . The next sum I propose to raise is from an increase of the duty upon the strength of spirits by making an addition in the proportion of one to ten , upon fourteen degrees above the present strength , and this I calculate will produce 130,000l . a year ; but as it will only operate for two months , I may state it at 32,500l . The third mode , by which I mean to raise what is necessary for the payment of the interest of this Loan , is by increasing the quantity of work on licensed Stills , which will produce 240,000l . a year . Now , at this last measure , as well as the preceding one , will not operate till about the 5th of November as the present laws enable his majesty then to allow distilleries to commence , I may state the sum likely to be raised in these two months at 60,000l . These three sums will produce 216,500l . which is about 2,000l . above what I will require for the purpose intended . This , I think , can give us no reason to despond . There has been no fall off in the Revenue in regard to stamps , but an increase ; no fail off in that arising from the post-office , nor in the assessed taxes , but each have increased.—The only fall off in the Revenue has been in the instance of the Excise Duties
