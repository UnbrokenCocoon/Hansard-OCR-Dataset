, that pursuant to an order of the house , duplicates were now always laid upon the table ; and as to the length of time lost in printing , the hon . member would recollect that of all printing , figure printing was the most tedious and intricate . asked if the only advantage to be derived from laying these Annual Accounts on the table , was their consideration on this particular day ? and contended that their production at any period of the session , would operate as a sufficient check , although they might not be produced previous to the opening of the Budget . bore testimony to the difficulty of getting the Accounts ready even by the 25th of March . said , that last session he wished to look at these accounts , and was informed that they were gone to the printer 's , and that he could not see them . Duplicates of the Irish Accounts , he knew , had not been laid upon the table , and that led him to suppose , that the same was then the case with respect to the Accounts of this country . The Accounts of the produce of the War-Taxes were then referred to the committee ; when the house having resolved itself into a Committee of Ways and Means , rose , pursuant to notice , to submit to the committee a statement of the Ways and Means of the year . In proceeding to propose the resolution with which he meant to conclude , for ratifying the contract , made that morning by the Treasury , for a Loan of 14,600,000l . to complete the Ways and Means , of the year , it would not be necessary for him to take up much of the time or attention of the committee by any introductory remarks . The satisfactory nature of the contract , and the advantageous terms for the public , upon which it had been concluded , would be sufficient to entitle it to the earnest attention of the committee , and the entire approbation of parliament . Without further preface , therefore , he should proceed to the important duty he had to perform , in stating the Supplies which had been voted for the service of the present year , and then in succession the correspondent Ways and Means which had been provided to defray those supplies . The committee would observe , that there were but few of the supplies which he had to enumerate , which had not been already voted ; but as he went along , he proposed to point out what were yet to be voted by parliament . The supplies voted were : SUPPLIES . £ Navy 18,986,867 Army 21,144,770 Ordnance , England 5,275,298 5,903,174 Ireland 627,876 Miscellaneous , England 1,173,751 1,900,000 Ireland 726,249 Vote of Credit , England 3,000,000 3,300,000 Ireland 300,000 Swedish Subsidy 300,000 Sicilian Subsidy 400,000 Total Joint Charge 51,934,911 532 England 's Separate Charges .
