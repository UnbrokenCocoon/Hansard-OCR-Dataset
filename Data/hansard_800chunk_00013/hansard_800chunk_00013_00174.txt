collect provisions and disperse the Portuguese force ; but sir Arthur Wellesley , with that promptitude and vigour for which his military life has been distinguished , attacked and defeated that officer at Roleia , before he could form his junction with Laborde , who was employed for similar purposes in the province of Beira . His lordship said it would be difficult to estimate the advantages the British army derived from the actual state of the country . Its effect , in the instance already given , has been shown ; the organization 283 in the neighbourhood of Oporto had amounted , by official report , to above 25,000 men , a part of whom were armed and acting with sir Arthur Wellesley : but his lordship observed , it was not his intention to go into the history of the campaign . He should however have no difficulty in explicitly declaring that he wholly approved of every thing sir Arthur Wellesley had done , whilst he had the command , but that he could neither concur in the expediency of the armistice or convention . These measures were adopted under the contemplation of a campaign in the north of Spain , and taking Burgos as the point to which the march of the British army was to be directed , it would appear singular that an agreement should have been made with the French general , by which it had been so contrived , that the forces he then commanded , and which had been defeated by the British , should have been embarked for France , and actually have reached Burgos many days before the conquering army could have arrived there , even if it had met with no interruption on its march.—It was proved , his lordship said , by the papers on the table , that general Junot was at Vittoria with the division which had served under him in Portugal on the 12th of December , the earliest day on which sir John Moore could assemble his army at Salamanca ; volumes could not more fully illustrate the impolicy of the convention . Were it necessary to go further into that subject , lord Buckinghamshire said it would be sufficient to refer their lordships to the unanswerable reasoning of the Earl of Moira in his protest against the opinions of the majority of the Court of Inquiry.—It would be recollected , his lordship proceeded to observe , that in the month of July official representations had been made to his majesty 's government , that the people of the north and south of Portugal , having followed the example of the Spanish nation , had established juntas . That of the north having been designated the Junta of Oporto , acknowledging the bishop of Oporto as the head of the government ; and that of the south the Junta of Algarva , with the count Monteiro Mor as their president . With the knowledge of the existence of these juntas , when the expulsion of the French army from Portugal might confidently be expected , it became the duty of his majesty 's ministers to consider in what manner it would be most advisable to form a provisional go- 284 vernment in that country , until , the subject could be submitted for the decision of the prince regent ; and with a view to such an arrangement as would appear most likely to be satisfactory both to the prince and the people . The knowledge of the opinions of the representative of the prince regent , who was in correspondence with him and the juntas , did seem to present the most easy and natural course for arriving at a right determination . Unfortunately however a measure had been resolved upon , to which it was known that the representative of the prince regent could not give his sanction . It was matter of notoriety that the whole of the regency left by the prince for the purpose of preserving his interests , and those of his faithful and loyal subjects who had accompanied him to the Brazils , had betrayed their trust
