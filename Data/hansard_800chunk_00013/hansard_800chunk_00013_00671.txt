sending writs to decayed boroughs * ; nor was it till the prerogatives of the Crown were encroached upon at the era of the Revolution , when the seeds of this Rotten-borough System , which have since grown so luxuriantly and have produced such poisonous effects , the baneful influence of which we now so sensibly feel , were with woeful prodigality first scattered over the land , that the Country was deprived of that corrective wisely lodged in the hands of the Crown by the Constitution , for its preservation against the unavoidable innovations of time , whilst the people , artfully led to ascribe all the evils of the two former reigns to Prerogative alone , willingly acquiesced in its retrenchment ; in which they made a fatal mistake , a mistake originating in the idea that they extended their own Liberties in proportion as they curtailed the Prerogative of the Crown ; an ingredient in the Constitution as essential to its existence , as is an uncorrupt , full and fair Representation of the People in this House . Had the constitutional power of the Crown remained undiminished , this House would not now be in its present contaminated state , the just and great prerogative of the Crown would have been exercised beneficially , and given the King his proper weight in the administration of national affairs , whilst the People would have a shield—and a shield and not a sword is all the people expect , in an uncorrupted and fairly elected House of Commons.—This I take to be the Constitution of England ; but out of this usurpation upon the crown , * '' Next , that all the Sheriffs be charged that they do not direct any Precept for electing and returning of any Burgesses to or for any ancient Borough within their Counties , being so utterly ruined and decayed , that there are not sufficient resyantes to make such choice , and of whom lawful election may be made .

'' And how strikingly that observation is exemplified in the consequences which have followed the departure from the principles of the Constitution , which has led to the establishment of this grievous Borough-monger System : the inconsistency of which with the principles of our laws and institutions , so glaring in the terms of the Writs of Elections , as in every other point of view , no one can dispute . The simple principle upon which , as upon a pivot , the whole of this subject of Representation turns , is this ; that the free subjects of this kingdom have a Right of Property in their own goods ; in other words , that the people of England can not be legally and constitutionally taxed without their own consent.—I suppose this will not be denied ; and yet it is equally indisputable , that this principle is absolutely annihilated by the present frame of the Representation of this
