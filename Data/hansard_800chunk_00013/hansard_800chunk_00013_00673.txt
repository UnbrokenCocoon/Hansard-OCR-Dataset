endured , that four millions of Irishmen should be aliens and outlaws in their native land ? Is it safe to have four millions of the people thrust out of the pale of the Constitution ? Is it consistent with reason , with common sense , putting justice out of the question , any longer to tolerate such a system ? By the adoption of Reform , the government will have the fairest opportunity of removing the principal grounds of dissatisfaction in Ireland ; now will be the time to do every thing without yielding any thing , to legislate upon enlarged principles , knowing nothing of particular parties , sects , or factions : keeping alive no distinctions of Catholic , Protestant , and Presbyterian , Tory , Whig , or Jacobin ; alarming no prejudice , insulting no party , they may now include the whole within one bond of union of the Constitution , embracing and ensuring the safety and tranquillity of the empire at large.—We shall then , and not till then , have an United Kingdom—one King—one People.—We shall by this recurrence to the Constitution , not only seat the Chief Magistrate upon his throne , and fix the Crown upon his head , but we shall place within his hand the sceptre and legitimate power of the King , in despite of those 157 Borough-mongers , who have TRAITEROUSLY usurped all but the pageantry and outward shew and forms of Royalty . What is the condition of the King under this Faction ? Instead of taking advantage of the elevation of his situation , where the Constitution had placed him , as the eye of the nation , for the purpose of taking extensive views for the advantage of the national interests , beyond the contracted horizon of ordinary men , his whole time is employed , his whole skill directed , not towards the duties of his high office , but in trying to keep his balance , in endeavouring to conciliate the support of such and such a Borough-monger , in order to 1052 obtain his permission to allow the Government to go on.—In truth , the Borough Faction have such power , that he is more like a Rope Dancer , than a King ; as they make it necessary for him to be perpetually upon the alert to balance himself on his slippery elevation , whilst the utmost he can do is to keep his place . Such is the state to which he is reduced under the influence of this ignominious system , instead of having his throne fixed on the rock of the Constitution , and bound to the hearts of a whole people . This is not the situation in which the Laws and Constitution have placed the King , nor that which his dignity requires , and the best interests of the people demand . The System , of which I have now given but a short sketch , which was introduced at the Revolution , and grew out of the encroachments on the Prerogative of the King , aided by the innovations of time , has already cost this nation nearly Eight Hundred Millions of Debt ; for though it has been wittily said , that one half of this enormous Debt has been incurred in resisting the perfidy and restless ambition of the house of Bourbon , the other half in striving to replace it on the throne of France , this is not true : the fact is , the whole has been incurred in the prosecution of the scheme of corrupting this House . This question is so completely decided by Magna Charta , `` which , '' as Lord Coke says , `` is such a fellow that he will `` bear no equal , '' so strongly fortified by all our constitutional laws , that no inferior authority can be required ; but , were I so disposed , I could cite a host of legal and constitutional Writers ; and all those members of this house , who have from time to time expressed their sentiments in support of
