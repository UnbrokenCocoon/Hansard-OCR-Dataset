betrayed a confirmed disposition to depreciate all public men , as well as a total disinclination to accept and pursue any system of Reform , haying moderation for its principle and basis . But , as he said before , it was not from such meetings that he collected the sense of the people . It was impossible for him not to look round the country , and to hear the expression of public opinion echoed from every corner of it . With respect to the objection against the indefinite nature of his motion , he would say , that the form in which it was submitted to the house was not of his dictation . On that subject he had consulted some of the ablest men in the house , and particularly the distinguished character in the Chair . He must again disclaim for himself any connection with tavern meetings . The hon . member thought wrong of him if he supposed he thought differently of the late meeting at the Crown and Anchor from himself.â€”After the very able explanation given of the bill by the right hon . gent . below him , he should not trespass on the indulgence of the house by any further observations . He must , however , again repeat , that the object of the bill was to prevent the obtaining of seats in parliament by direct , flagrant , palpable corruption , and not to do away the operation of influence . He could not believe that any member of that house , any man in the country , would be capable of an act so immoral as the violation of the sanction he meant to propose . He knew that he had great difficulties to encounter , but he trusted , with the assistance of the house , he should be able to surmount them . His bill would have no reference to the act of William and Mary , commonly called the Treating Act . The question being put , the motion was carried ; and Mr. Curwen , Mr. Ponsonby , sir A. Pigott , sir S. Romilly , lord Folke- 380 stone , Mr. Windham , and others , were ordered to prepare and bring in the bill . brought in a Bill for the more effectual Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals . The Bill was read a first time , and ordered to be printed ; and his lordship gave notice that on Monday , if it were then printed , he would fix a day for the second reading . rose to bring forward the motion of which he had given notice some days ago , relating to corrupt practices of the Treasury with respect to the return of Members to Parliament . He observed , that he was fully aware that he had no claim on the attention of the house , but that which he derived from the very important nature of the subject that he felt it his duty to lay before them . The task he had undertaken was most ungracious and unpleasant ; and nothing but a strong sense of public duty should have induced him to place himself in the situation of becoming the accuser of any man . It would not be necessary for him to trespass long upon the indulgence of the house . The substance of the motion he meant to propose lay in a very narrow compass . It consisted in a charge of corrupt practices against two of its members . He wished only to be permitted to make one prefatory observation , and it was this , that the facts that came to his knowledge were so dangerous , so prejudicial to the genuine spirit and principles of the constitution , that he would have justly merited to be stigmatized as a traitor to his country if he had declined to lay them before the house . Before he proceeded further , he would move that the several entries on the Journals relating to the proceedings against the two Shepherds , members of that house , be read . [ The clerk here
