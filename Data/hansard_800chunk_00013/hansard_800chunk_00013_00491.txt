their 774 designs should fail , and the public would begin to think too favourably of the house . It was their desire to raise a popular ferment , by talking of abuses which often had no existence , and by vaunting of remedies which they never meant to put in execution ! Far was it from their thoughts to come manfully and constitutionally down to that house and state their complaints , if any such they really had . No , it suited them better to make harangues at taverns , to mount the tables , at the Crown and Anchor , to tell the people to meet as the people , and look not for redress to their representatives , who were no longer fit to be called an House of Commons . It was their plan to raise a cry by which the infatuated multitude , might be hurried to their ruin , by hinting at corruptions which never had existence , and rousing expectations which never could be gratified . Now that the hon . baronet , whom he did not mean to designate as the leader of the party , ( a distinction in his mind due to others who did not choose to appear so openly as himself ) had favoured that corrupt house with his pure presence , he wished to put a few questions to him as to one of his reputed harangues at the Crown and Anchor , which pointed pretty plainly at his ( Mr. Tierney 's ) character . Broad and indelicate were the freedoms which had been used with his name and political life in the course of the speech to which he alluded ; and in one part of it the worthy baronet was actually represented as having the audacity to say that on his ( Mr. Tierney 's ) retiring from office , his pockets were filled with the public money . Was this charge true ? He now-demanded of the worthy baronet , would he dare to repeat his assertion ? If not , he would recommend it to him not again to vilify the name and character of an absent man ; or if he did not so vilify it , to take care that a correct report of his real sentiments should go forth to the public . How did he know what effect such insinuations might have in the course of the summer ? How could he hope not to be attacked by some seditious mob , roused against him by such unfounded calumnies ? ( Hear ! ) Such an assertion was directly false , and he called on the worthy baronet either to deny or to own it . He did not know how the worthy baronet could bring himself to make such an assertion ; for his amiable manners in private life , and his conciliatory conduct , were proverbial . No man could be more mild than ha was 775 until he mourned the rostrum at the Crown and Anchor ; then all was changed , all was abuse , and as far as related to him , calumny . In this instance , not only his design , but his ignorance , was exposed ; and to prove it , he would offer the worthy baronet , if he wished to turn a penny honestly , ( loud cheers ) some thousand pounds , provided he would take on him the profit and loss of his political speculations . But what were the worthy baronet 's qualifications for this general censorship ? What had he ever done ? What feats had he performed ? Why , indeed , he had harangued the mob and mounted the tables most eloquently at the public taverns . ( Hear , hear ! ) He had never warded off any real danger , but had fluttered about during his public life , apolitical sea-gull , screaming , and screeching and sputtering about foul weather which never arrived . It was true the worthy baronet had never been troubled with office ; the reasons for that might be various ; perhaps the
