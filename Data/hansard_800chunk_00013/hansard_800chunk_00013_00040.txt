that of inducing or even compelling the Bank of Ireland to give Bank of England Notes in exchange for their own on demand , or to make their own exchangeable for them in London , or to give Bills of Exchange on London for them , , have been suggested ; 80 and there is no doubt any of them would have the effect of rectifying the exchange . The objection that has been made to this proposal , is the difficulty and expence to the Bank of Ireland which would attend the procuring a fund in London on which to draw . On this your Committee observe generally , that neither the difficulty nor the expence attendant on this measure would be so great as that to which the Bank , by its constitution , is necessarily subject at all times when not protected by a restriction from performing its engagements ; and that whatever funds the Bank formerly applied , or intend again to apply , on the removal of the restriction , to provide for the difficulty and expence of obtaining a supply of gold , might in the interim be applied to the procuring of English Bank notes ; the Evidence of Mr. Winthrop points out the practicability of obtaining a sufficient supply of Bank of England notes with such a fund ; his expression is , that 'the Bank of Ireland , or any person , may procure Bank notes now to any extent if they will pay for them . ' But Mr. Mansfield 's Evidence so clearly shews the practical mode of carrying this measure into effect , that your committee can not impress it too strongly upon the attention of the house ; it shews , in the example of Scotland , how effectually a very small sum , vigorously and wisely applied , did operate , and that banks there did establish an adequate fund , with ultimate advantage to themselves.—His account states , that 'There was , after the peace of Versailles in 1763 , an exchange of 5 or 6 per cent . against Scotland with London , created by per-sons collecting Gold from the different banks there , bringing it to London , and passing their bills at Edinburgh for it , in order to put a profit into their own pockets by raising the exchange . The 'two chartered Banks of Scotland seeing that this exchange arose from artificial means , collected as much funds as they could to bring to London , and by draw-ing gradually at ½ or 1 per cent . less than the others , reduced the exchange to what they esteemed par bills of 40 days date ; ' at which it has steadily continued ever since , unaffected by the failure of the Bank of Ayr ; the convulsions to credit in general in 1792 and 1793 ; the failures in 1795 ; and the difficulties which caused the restriction in 1797 in England , but which was not extended to the chartered Banks of Scotland ; and all this not- 81 withstanding the great presumption , that if an account of ail pecuniary transactions between Scotland and England could be ascertained , it must have often happened that the balance was against the one country or the other.—This fact gives great force to the arguments of those witnesses who propose that the Bank of Ireland should establish a credit for the like purpose in London ; and the present peculiar situation of the Irish Finances not only point out a ready , but an adequate and effective fund , which at the same time that it gives to the Bank of Ireland every prospect of success , which has attended the measures of the chartered Banks of Scotland , exempts it from all expence , risk , or difficulty which might attend it ; for your Committee must observe , that the Bank of Scotland undertook to provide this fund at their own expence , but the Bank of Ireland has an opportunity of establishing it without expence to themselves ; and further , it appears to have been suggested
