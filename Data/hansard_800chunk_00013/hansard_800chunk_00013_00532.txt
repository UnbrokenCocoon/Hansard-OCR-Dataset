the course which these Debates have taken , three distinct points have been put in issue : First , Whether the traffic be a Political Evil ; in the next place . Whether it be any Parliamentary Offence ; and lastly , whether there is any safe and practicable Remedy by which this mischief can be put down for the time to come . Sir ; Into the first point , Whether this be a Political Evil , I do not mean to enter at any length ; nor is it necessary to my purpose . That the Influence of Property in maintaining Civil Order is of the highest importance , no man living can doubt : it is the firmest cement to all the relations of social life , it gives Stability to the State , and Prosperity to the Empire . That the Possessions of Property may , and must , and ought to have a predominating Influence in the Election of Members to serve in this house , I think is equally clear . But , that , abandoning all their legitimate rights of Influence , and laying aside all the virtuous and generous Motives of Friendship , Affection , and the fair preference of Talents and Integrity to fill places of such high Public Trust , they should go to a shameless and open market ; that they should sell the Attachment of their Friends , Neighbours , and Dependants , for dry and sordid gain ; and sell it to utter Strangers , of whose Qualities they can have no other Estimate than the Weight of their Purses ; this does indeed appear to me to be a great Political Evil , and a great Public Grievance . It degrades 839 and debases the habits of the higher ranks of life , who confess their own sense of the nature of these transactions , by the concealment with which they seek to cover them : It taints also and contaminates the general Character of Parliament : and it furnishes the most formidable weapons to those who are professing , and I am willing to believe sincerely professing , to reform , but as I fear , are , in truth and in fact , by the tendency of their endeavours , labouring to subvert the entire System of our Parliamentary Representation . With respect , Sir , to the next Question , whether these practices are any Parliamentary Offence . That it is a high Parliamentary Offence , every page of our History , Statutes , and Journals appears to me to bear evidence . It is essential to the very idea of Elections that they should be free , ( a ) Such is the antient language of the Statute of Westminster in the reign of Edward the First , speaking of Elections in general ( b ) : such also is the modern language of the Bill of Rights , with reference specifically to the Election of Members to serve in Parliament ; ( c ) and we have a memorable instance in the year immediately following the Revolution of the sense in which this fundamental principle was understood , in the case of the Cinque Ports ; for by a Statute in the Second or William and Mary , it is not enacted only , but declared , that for the Lord Warden to nominate or recommend any Member to serve in any Port or Place within his jurisdiction , was a violation of the Freedom of Parliaments , and contrary to the Antient Laws and Constitution of the Realm ( d ) In the description of these Offences , which constitute a Violation of our Privileges , there is nothing technically narrow , but the Rule is to be tried by its substantial Effects . Force , Fraud , Corrupt practices and undue influence of any sort , by which the freedom of Elections is controlled , have , been reprobated in all ages . These Offences , if pursued as matter of personal delinqu√®ncy , were antiently triable before the Committee of Privileges ; if they touched the Seat ,
