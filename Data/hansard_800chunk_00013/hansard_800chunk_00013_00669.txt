in death , to which we see and daily hear of men offering themselves up willing victims . As our senses , though they may be affected all together , are still distinct ; in like manner our minds , though they may be affected at one and the same time by more motives than one , yet do they remain unmixed . But there may be a great convenience in adopting this doctrine of Mixed Motives , similar to that experienced some time since in keeping mixed accounts ; such mixture serving to create confusion and avert detection . I defy any man , however , to shew that such a doctrine is reconcileable either with morality or logic . There is one other doctrine , which can not be passed over without animadversion , equally dangerous , in my mind , with the foregoing ones . It has been held , that whilst the forms of the Constitution remained there was something so excellent in the mere forms , that not only was the possession of them of the highest value , but a hope was thereby justified of an amelioration of the state of the country . My opinion is directly the reverse of this , in which I am supported by the authority of the greatest historians and writers upon political subject ; who have uniformly laid it down , that of all tyrannies a legislative tyranny exercised under the forms of a free government , is the most tremendous and fatal ; because without hope of remedy . Tacitus , whose penetration and ability will not be disputed , depicting the melancholy condition of the Roman Empire , under that relentless tyrant Tiberius , describes it as most deplorable , not only on account of flagitious acts proceeding from hypocrisy and despotism united , but still more so on account of its hopeless condition , whilst under the mask of freedom , uncontroulable power was exercised , because that cruel tyranny was carried on under the forms of the ancient constitution . There was still a Senate debating , Con- 1046 suls appointed , and tribunes of the people , and all the Forms of the ancient republic studiously preserved ; and by how much the more those forms served as a cloke to hide the odious features of despotic power , by so much the more was it terrible , irresistible and severe : `` Quantoque majore , '' says Tacitus , `` libertatis imaginœ tegebantur , tanto `` irruptura ad infentius servitium '' ; therefore , I am not all disposed to be satisfied with the forms , when the spirit and essence of the Constitution have fled.—We have been reminded of the old fable of the Stag and the Horse , introduced with the view , as it should seem , of warning the people against throwing themselves into the arms of one power , in order to avoid falling into those of another . The application of this fable could not be mistaken ; it meant , that the People should not seek to ally themselves with the Crown , in order to rid themselves of the grievance of a corrupt House of Commons . To that warning I can not lend an ear , having no dread of the Prerogative of the Crown ; which I know forms part of the law of the land , and is material and necessary to maintain the Constitution . My only apprehension is , from the usurpation of the legitimate Prerogative , by the Borough Monger Faction , and the consequent abuse of it by the agents of that Faction ; untruly stiling themselves Ministers of the King , Servants of the Crown , through the medium of this House falsely denominating itself the Representative of the People.—My desire , therefore , is to erect a barrier against such usurpation and abuse , by a restoration of the fair balance of the Constitution , by giving to each branch its lawful right : thus providing at once for the defence of the Prerogative of the Crown and the protection of the undoubted unalienable
