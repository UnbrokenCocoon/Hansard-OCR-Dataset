of the citizens of the said city , but the acknowledged right of every subject of the British empire who is accused of crimes and misdemeanors , to have an indictment preferred before the best men of his county , who are to determine whether there be sufficient cause to put him on his trial ; but , as a Grand Jury is not always sitting , and as danger might arise to the state in some cases from the delay of assembling a Grand Jury , the practice of filing a criminal information before the king at Westminster has been tacitly conceded to the Attorney-General of the crown , at such times as no 176 Grand Jury shall be assembled ; but it has never been contended that the subject should be deprived of the privilege of having his case submitted to a Grand Jury of his county , before he be put upon his trial , except where pernicious consequences to the state would arise from the delay of calling together such Jury ; but this could not obtain in the case of your Petitioner , because a Grand Jury of his county , namely , of the city of London , were actually sitting at the very time the criminal informations were filed against him at Westminster . `` Your Petitioner humbly craves leave to remind your honourable house that it was not even alledged in the said criminal informations that the matter which gave rise to them was false or untrue , though the matter was alledged to be scandalous and malicious , and that it was the usage of the court of King 's Bench , till within the last forty years , not to permit any information to be filed for libelloas matter , which was not alledged to be false as well as malicious , and indeed the most recent determination on the subject coincides with the opinions uniformly maintained by our ancestors ; for , in the case of sir John Carr , and Hood and Sharpe , the plaintiff did not recover in action for a publication which was true , though admitted to be malicious and injurious . `` Your Petitioner having had a criminal information filed against him , of the nature , and under the circumstances above stated , the Solicitor for the crown moved for a Special Jury , to which motion the judges of the court of King 's Bench acceded , and a Special Jury was awarded of such freeholders who were entered in the freeholders ' Book belonging to the Sheriff , with the addition of Freeholder and Merchant , which Special Jury was struck , not by the Sheriff , but by the Master of the Crown-Office , who is a servant of the crown , —the prosecutor in this instance ; —and the names were not taken as named by the said Master , but several were passed over after he had named them , because he stated them to be not likely to attend , thereby subverting one of the principles of British justice , which directs that a Jury shall be impartially selected , and attendance enforced by fines of the court ; and , indeed , the Master of the Crown-Office might prevent all impartial persons from being summoned on a Jury destined , to try between the crown and the subject , if every name be passed over which he 177 determines to be a person not likely to attend . And this conduct of the Returning Officer is conceived to be strong presumptive evidence that he knows the characters of the persons to be summoned , and has the power of acting with partiality , which power is contrary to the constitution of these realms , and is strongly guarded against by the laws , in cases where no attempts are made to take the trial out of the common course of justice ; for , the Under-Sheriff ( who summons Juries ) can not continue in office longer than one year , nor be re-chosen till after an interval of two years , lest , from
