with respect to it . Then it would be in his power to bring 278 forward any motion he should think necessary upon the subject . declared that he had not meant any thing personal to the right hon . Secretary at War ; neither did he feel any personal hostility to his majesty 's ministers ; for he could assure them that he did not wish to see any other set of gentlemen in their places . All he had in view in his motion was to shew , that there were faults in the conduct of the Office to which it referred , which faults he wished to have corrected . He would withdraw his motion until some day next week . The motion was thon withdrawn . said , that it was with reluctance he had given their lordships the trouble of an attendance on account of the motion he intended upon that occasion to submit to the house , but in truth , he considered the subject of Portugal so important , not only with reference to the arduous contest in which the people of the peninsula were engaged against the French , but to the essential and permanent interest of Great Britain , that he should neglect what he deemed an act of indispensable duty , were he not to bring the question , of which he had given notice , under their lordships ' consideration.—He thought it necessary , as a preliminary observation , to declare his perfect acquiescence in the sentiments of a noble friend of his ( lord Sidmouth ) , respecting the doctrines laid down upon a former occasion by the Secretary of State ( lord Liverpool ) with regard to the production of papers , and the right of the house to interfere in matters of pending negotiation .

Portugal , he said , was so situated as to afford the readiest means of assistance to the Spaniards , either in the centre , the north , or the south of Spain ; an advantage , in the present contest , the most momentous that could be conceived ; and which was truly described by the Junta of Gallicia , when `` they expressed to sir Arthur Wellesley the greatest anxiety , that the troops under his command should be employed in driving the French out of Portugal , as they were persuaded that the Spaniards of the north and south of the peninsula could never have any decided success independently of each other , and could never make any great simultaneous effort to remove the French from Spain , till they should be driven from Portugal , and the British troops should connect the operations of the northern and southern armies . `` —The success of the Spaniards , his lordship remarked , might thus be improved , and any reverses the French might meet with rendered fatal by a sudden and judicious movement of the British troops.—The strength of Portugal , he said , as a military position , was not only known to the professional men who had served in that country , but must be obvious to every one who had referred to the maps .
