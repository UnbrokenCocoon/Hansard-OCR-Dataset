the sterility of the soil in most of the provinces , were circumstances of infinite weight in a defensive campaign . A country that does not furnish subsistence to its inhabitants for seven months in the year , may easily be placed in a situation that would leave nothing for an invading army to live upon.—Without going further back into the history of Portugal than the seven year 's war , the campaign under the comte de la Lippe will afford ample information as to the natural means of defence afforded by Portugal . That able general found the Portuguese army without discipline and without any officers of experience to form or conduct it ; but the spirit of the 280 people was roused , the confidence placed in him by the government was unlimited , the resolution to exertion most decided , and although he never was able to bring into the field an army of 17,000 men , 3,000 of whom indeed were British , contrived to baffle all the efforts , and defeat the plans of a combined force of 42,000 men , 6 , OOO of whom were French , under the command of the prince de Beauvais.—As testimonies of the hardihood , obedience , and bravery of the Portuguese soldiers , his lordship then cited the following instances—Lord Townsend , in a letter to the marquis de Pombal , of the 17th Feb 1763 , writes thus : `` Notwithstanding all these fatigues and difficulties , the Portuguese soldier obeyed with the greatest cheerfulness ; and I ought to add to his praise , that if he was ill clothed and ill disciplined , he was at the same time contented and subordinate beyond any thing I had ever seen in any part of the world . What advantages might not one expect from such a disposition improved by military art ? `` —Le Comte de la Lippe , in his memoire , speaking of a march made by lord Townsend , says : `` This march was executed by the skill of general Townsend , and by the admirable perseverance of the Portuguese troops , who supported the greatest misery . The larger proportion of them having worn out their shoes ; marched gaiment over steep rocks , leaving on their route the traces of their pieds ensanglantes . '' A French author , the Due de Chatelet , speaking of Portugal , expresses himself in the following manner : `` The inhabitants whereof are naturally spirited , and in whom valour has escaped that torpor ( engourdissment ) which has nearly taken possession of all their other faculties . `` —Lord Buckinghamshire said , he had adverted to these authorities for the purpose of shewing what might have been done , had the proper measure been resorted to , for calling into action the resources which Portugal was calculated to afford ; and , whilst he contemplated with satisfaction the steps which the government were then taking , he had only to express his hope , that they might not be too late.—He could not leave this part of the subject without stating to their lordships that he had seen a most able plan of an attack upon Portugal from Spain , written by a Frenchman in the year 1767 , when calculating the Portuguese army at 30,000 men , he allots a force of 75,000 for the attack , judiciously tracing the 281 whole progress of the campaign , the preparation for which , he says , must be made before the breaking out of war , as it would be indispensably necessary to collect provisions for the whole army , urging as a consideration nearly conclusive upon the success of the undertaking , that it should be executed with a rapidity that did not admit of the arrival of British succours . If such was the opinion of a person whose work no man could read without the most thorough conviction of his capacity to form a correct opinion upon the subject—if an attack upon Portugal in order to be effectual , required such preparation , and such means , and
