, there was nothing in it ; it was joking with the public ; it was laughing in their faces , and giving them more than pretence for saying to that house what Dr. Johnson said to Macpherson , `` Hereafter I shall be more inclined to believe what you shall prove than what you shall say . `` â€”They indeed , said a great deal in all conscience , , and it was now time for them to do something . The public had observed the course they had taken during the session , and would not be inattentive to the manner in which they would close their career . As to the right hon . gent . 's opposition , he believed it to be a government measure , and meant nothing personal towards that right hon . gent . Though his hon . friend was deserving of great praise for having introduced the bill , yet , after the alterations it had undergone , it would do him now but little credit ; and he would advise him to take care that it should go out to the world not as his , but as the measure of the right hon . gentleman . For the reasons he had stated , he must oppose the bill . said a few words against the bill . He thought that if the bill was suffered to pass , it would stand in the way of something better , and that on the other hand , if it was thrown out , something more effectual would be substituted in its place .

But his lordship observed , that in all times it had been the same case according to the number and proportion of bills before them . As to the transfer and disposal of Law Offices , he believed there was not on record an instance where the patronage bestowed on the Keeper of the Great Seal had been abused , from the Revolution to the present hour , although that patronage was a main link in the chain that fitted each noble person who preceded him in office during that period , to have the personal means of holding rank consistently and suitably with others of their lordships .
