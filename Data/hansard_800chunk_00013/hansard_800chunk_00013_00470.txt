of property is to continue , such as has hitherto been practised and allowed of ? It is indifferent to me which side of the alternative they take ; but let them be well aware that such is the alternative to which they will be reduced : and that if they contend generally , as is now done , that such and such things are corrupt , because they admit the consideration of interest in matters which ought to be exclusively decided on principles of duty , it is in vain for them hereafter to contend that any man has a right to influence his tenants , or tradesmen , or workmen , by any other means at least than those by which he may equally influence the tenants , tradesmen , or workmen of any other person ; that is to say , by his talents or by his virtues , by the services which he may have done , and the gratitude he may have inspired . When I look therefore to the moral qualities of these acts , as independent of and antecedent to positive law , I am at a loss to find what it is , either on the score of principle or of authority , that determines them to be corrupt , or that enables us , if they are corrupt , to exempt from the same sentence of corruption nine tenths of the influence , which has hitherto been supposed to be attached , and legitimately attached , to property , and which , for aught that at present appears , there is no intention of taking away . 745 But though such may be the result of an inquiry into the moral constitution of these acts , there can be no doubt , that the law may render corrupt any act which it pleases , that is to say , the law may make any act which it pleases illegal : and to do , or procure to be done , an illegal act , from an interested motive , is , I apprehend , corruption . We are to inquire therefore , in what manner and to what degree , those acts , which generally speaking are not corrupt , have been rendered so by positive law . And first , without affirming or denying the fact , let us examine the conclusiveness and validity of the arguments , by which it has hitherto been attempted to be proved . It has been said by those from whom I should have expected better reasoning , that the corruption follows of necessity from the laws respecting bribery in the case of individual voters ; for that it is impossible that the law should be guilty of such monstrous inconsistency , as well as of such a flagrant injustice , as to punish the poor for bribery in retail , while they suffer it to be practised with impunity by the rich in wholesale . There is something so wildly inconclusive in this argument , as to make it difficult to set about formally to confute it . I can not better illustrate its fallacy than by an argument something of the same sort , quite as good in respect to conclusiveness , and much better in respect to point and archness , which I remember when I was a boy , at a contested election for the county of Norfolk ; where one of the candidates , a most respectable man , had rendered himself obnoxious by the inclosure of a common , ( a proceeding less familiar at that time than it has become since , and better calculated therefore to be made a subject of popular clamour ) ; upon which the wit of the day was to ask , in way of dialogue , what that man deserved who should steal a goose from a common ? and when the answer was given , to follow up the question by another , what then shall be done to him who steals the common from the goose ? This was very good election wit , but certainly very bad argument
