, and that it should be the subject , not of angry contention , but of fair discussion . At the same time , there are some doctrines and opinions which have been recently promulgated in this house , of so misleading and mischievous a tendency , that I can not allow myself to pass them over altogether without some animadversion . The course I have prescribed for myself is to state the Evils arising out of the defective state of the Representation , and then to point out the Remedy , which is simple , and perfectly practicable , not only consistent with the habits and interests of the people , and in unison with the laws and constitution of the country , but is ( as I think I can shew ) the Constitution itself : —Let others deal in whimsical speculations , in undefined mysterious notions of a Constitution , which eludes the grasp , and soars above the conception of ordinary minds , let them amuse themselves with intricate theories and fine-spun metaphysics , whilst I shall hold fast by that plain and substantial Constitution , adapted to the contemplation of common understandings , to be found in the Statute Book , and recognized by the Common Lam of the Land.—If it can be shown that the principles on which I proceed are erroneous , unconstitutional , and inconsistent with the ancient , fundamental laws of England , I shall stand corrected , and willingly abandon my proposition ; but if , on the contrary , I shall be able to demonstrate , that the present system is the creature of innovation , and a departure from the old , established , unrepealed laws of the country , and that a recurrence to the practice of these laws , is an easy and adequate remedy for the evil , though I may not indulge a hope of the 1043 concurrence of this house , yet I may hope for the approbation of the public , and , at all events , I shall enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that I have performed an essential duty , both to the people and myself , in bringing forward the present inquiry . Before I proceed to the consideration of the subject more immediately before the house , I think proper to make some remarks upon those very extraordinary doctrines to which I have before alluded.—It has been asserted , that Corruption is not only a part of our Constitution—that it was not only necessary and to be tolerated , but ( as it should seem ) that the Constitution was to be tolerated for the sake of the Corruption . We have heard it seriously alledged , that without the auxiliary of Corruption in this house the Constitution would be insecure , that the Government could not be carried on . It has been described as `` growing with our growth , and `` strengthening with our strength : '' it had been more consolatory to have been informed , that it decayed with our decay and diminished with our decrease . One can hardly conceive a more unhappy quotation for the purposes of those who have made the allusion . What is it the poet speaks of , when he says it `` Grows with our growth , and strengthens with our strength ? '' It is a state of disease necessarily terminating in final dissolution . `` The young disease , which must subdue at length `` Grows with our growth , and strengthens with our strength . '' It applies strongly , indeed , in favour of those who call for some Remedy to arrest the progress of destruction , for some stimulus to re-invigorate the Constitution and save it from decay , by extirpating the vile and loathsome canker of Corruption , which preying upon the vitals , palsies the energies , and consumes the substance , of the country.—The various and contradictory arguments by which this Corruption has been attempted to be defended challenge particular observation : at one lima it has been alledged to be so trifling as to be unworthy of
