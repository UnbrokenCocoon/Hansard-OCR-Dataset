his familiarity with office , he may be enabled to select a partial Jury . `` Your Petitioner also reminds this honourable house , that , by a statute of the 7th and 8th year of king William 3 , ( ch . 32 ) , it is enacted , that `` every summons of any person qualified to any of the aforesaid services , ( namely , serving on Juries ) , shall be made by the sheriff , his officer , or lawful deputy , six days before , at the least ; '' but in the case of your Petitioner , the summonses to the Jury were not delivered six days before the day of trial , nor five days before , nor four days before ; from which cause your Petitioner was not able to avail himself of a trial before a Special Jury , contrary to the rights of the subject and the law of the land and this circumstance of not summoning the Jury six days before the trial , contrary to the positive and explicit enactments of the law of the land , has prevented your Petitioner from bring tried by a Jury of such men as had been assigned him ; as his peers . `` Your Petitioner was not tried by a Jury of his peers ; for , as the court of King 's Bench had ruled that a Jury of freeholders and merchants were his peers , it necessarily follows that those who were neither freeholders nor merchants could not be his peers ; and yet those who were added to the Special Jury were neither freeholders nor merchants , and therefore were not his peers : —and of a Jury composed of men who were all of them neither peers of your Petitioner , nor peers among themselves , a verdict was given . `` Your Petitioner also craves the attention of this honourable house , to the words used by sir Nash Grose on the trial , in his charge to the Jury , which your Petitioner humbly presumes to have been a deviation from the spirit of the constitution , which enjoins lenity and impartiality 178 to form the basis of the conduct of every British Judge , to have been also inimical to the letter and fair interpretation of the Act of Parliament entitled , `` An Act to remove doubts respecting the functions of Juries in cases of Libel , '' which Act directs , that `` on every such trial , the Court or judge before whom such indictment or information shall be tried , shall , according to his or their discretion , give their or his opinion and directions to the Jury in the matter in issue between the king and the defendant or defendants , in like manner as in all other criminal cases . `` —Your Petitioner therefore prays to submit , for the decision of this honourable house , the propriety or impropriety of the following words , as used by sir Nash Grose on this occasion , and which instead of delivering an opinion or direction , `` as in all other criminal eposes , '' are conceived by your Petitioner to be unprecedented in the annals of modern British jurisprudence . The words that your Petitioner complains of , and which were taken down at the time by Mr. Farquharson , the short-hand writer , are as follows : — '' In order to shew that they are most wicked , gross , and abominable Libels , it is only necessary to read , not all , but one or two of them . But , gentlemen , under this Act of Parliament , I am to give you my opinion upon these publications , and I have no hesitation in saying that any thing mere libellous I never heard read : in my opinion . they are gross , scandalous , and abominable Libels !
