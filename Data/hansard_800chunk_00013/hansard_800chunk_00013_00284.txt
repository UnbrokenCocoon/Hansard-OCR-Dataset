the aids of sage counsel to give that enthusiasm direction and effect ? But , said the noble lord , what did not the people expect from the government ? Why , a great deal was unquestionably expected : —the subject was of a nature to excuse a generous people from expecting so much hum such ministers—it was pardonable at such a time to indulge in such extravagant expectations.—They expected their government would have been vigilant in the cause they had so sanguinely espoused—that they would have been prompt and vigorous in the measures they resorted to—but such an expectation was not to justify that government in their rashness , folly , and precipitancy . But , among the causes assigned by the noble lord for the sanguine hopes then entertained of ultimate success , was the circumstance of the preparations at that time making by the court of Austria , to taka advantage of that opportunity , and enlarge her military means to the greatest extent she could . If this was the case , he thought the noble lord had been imprudent in uttering that fact in his place in that house as a minister of the country ; such a statement coming from a minister would go to give a sort of colour to the charges that appeared in the Manifesto of the emperor of France , not that he thought that those 463 charges were founded in fact ; far from it ; but still he did think , that such a statement was calculated to give colour to those charges , and therefore was of opinion , that the noble lord had been indiscreet in mentioning that fact , if it was a fact , as he had done.—With respect to the Portuguese expedition , he condemned it as most ill advised ; there was no man who must not condemn it , and for the plainest of all possible reasons ; that had it succeeded , even its success would have had no material effect upon the fortunes of Spain , whereas , if Spain was once delivered , Portugal would thereby he secured . But what he particularly blamed ministers for was , their not taking proper precautionary measures to ascertain the real state and temper of Spain before our army had been embarked . That they had not done so was sufficiently clear from this one instance , were there no other—the division under sir A. Wellesley sailed on the 15th July , and the first step taken by ministers to ascertain the real state of Spain , and the sentiments prevailing there , was not resorted to until the 4th of August following ; but the strangest amongst all the strange arguments of the noble lord was that , by which he endeavoured to shew that , on account of the great interest taken in the co-operation of the British army by the Spanish government , our government was acquitted from all responsibility . This would be a sweeping argument to indemnify all ministers in all cases of alliances with foreign states ; for it would not be denied , that in each of them the respective government of each power would have its due portion of interest . But , notwithstanding this extraordinary interest which the Spanish government had taken , and which was to indemnify our own , it did not appear that this interest had produced any extraordinary co-operation ; for when the North of Spain had been fixed upon as the scene for British service , and sir David Baird had reached Corunna , ready to disembark his troops , it was in the memory of the house what delays he had to encounter before he was permitted to land—at one time upon one pretence , and at another time upon a different one ; but the real cause , according to sir David Baird 's own letter , was an objection upon their part to admit our troops to land there on account of the difficulty of supplying them with provisions , & c. And here the noble lord teemed to expect that his mere letter
