from their antiquity than valuable by reason of their intrinsic worth ; but this sentiment , laudable as in itself it may be , frequently is carried too far ; particularly where it renders us incapable of discriminating between the individuals who are guided by the light of reason , by the sole desire of altering in order to preserve , and those who are influenced by the most treasonable and base designs . The fate of other nations , which have fallen victims either to the treachery or ignorance of their political leaders , or have been overwhelmed by their blind , unbridled passions , adds not a little to the prevailing disinclination and distrust . The honest zeal of the reformer is set at nought ; the very excrescences are too sacred to be touched ; even the rust of time is to be respected , lest we should injure or deface . But in contemplating the fall of other states , we ought not to forget , that they refused to reform , while reformation was yet possible and safe ; neither should we confound with the leveller and revolutionist , those who are only desirous of doing away the abuses and imperfections arising from the operation of time , to which every government and all human institutions are more or less liable . The revolutionist would destroy , the reformer would preserve . It is only the ignorant and superstitious who fancy that that which was originally good , perhaps approaching to perfection , is not subject to corruption and decayâ€” '' corruptio optime pessimo . '' He had no doubt that the foundation and main pillars of the constitution were sound ; and while he admitted the theory of the composition of parliament to be admirable , it was impossible not to observe that the people were imperfectly represented , at the present period , in the house of commons . It was his duty to speak respectfully of the decisions of the house , although he had differed from many of those of the 1067 present sessions ; but he could not doubt , that had the house been otherwise constituted , the result of their deliberations would have been far different . Had the voice and wishes of the people possessed more influence , the appeals of the members for Oakhampton , Morpeth , Lanerkshire , Boston , Waterford , and Queen 's county , could not have been made in vain ; nor in the few instances in which ministers were defeated , had there been a different representation , would there have been found a set of men , hardy enough to have defended the measures which were arraigned , and by the vote of the house condemned . For instance , the motion of the member for Hull could not have met with opposition ; nor could a moment 's resistance have been offered to that of the worthy member for Waterford , who objected to a clause indemnifying from the operation of the law an entire class of his majesty 's subjects , which clause was defended by ministers on the extraordinary and disgusting plea of general and incorrigible corruptness ; a plea which contained a libel against the people of Ireland , and under the influence of which , an indecent attempt had been made to prevail on the house of commons to screen from punishment those who had corruptly violated the law . When the member for Carlisle , prompted by the purest zeal for the public interest , introduced a bill for `` securing the independence and purity of parliament , '' had the house been differently constituted , no minister would have ventured so to trifle with the feelings and interests of the people as to have converted that bill into one of a directly opposite tendency , a bill which he was one of those who thought ought rather to have been entitled `` a bill for more effectually preventing the sale of seats in parliament for money , and for promoting a monopoly thereof to the Treasury by the means of patronage .
