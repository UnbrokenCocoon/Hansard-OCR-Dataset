I do not believe what they say , that they can not give an account of the interest they have made upon the public money . I can not believe men , who , from their superior attainments in acuteness , method , and knowledge of figures , have been selected to conduct intricate matters of account for the public , when they come and tell me that in the management of their own private transactions , they have kept no account at all !

'' The following , which are the last words of the sentence , I can not but suppose , he amply feels , and that `` by a `` just retribution , '' he has `` completely `` sacrificed his own felicity .
