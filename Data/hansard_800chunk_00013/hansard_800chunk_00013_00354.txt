decision , and whether they are not precisely in point with the difficulties which I have anticipated , or with any others which opponents to the Bill can possibly anticipate ; I make a similar appeal to another noble and learned friend , who has filled the highest situation , I do not see him at this moment in his place , but to him also , I might make the same fearless application.—I can not , therefore , conceive a case on which a magistrate would be exposed to any difficulty under this bill , if it should pass into a law.—The cruelties which I have already adverted to , are either committed by owners or by servants charged with the care and government of horses and other cattle . If the owner unmercifully directs them to be driven to most unreasonable distances , or with burthens manifestly beyond their powers ; if he brings them up when past the age of strength , not for a use correspondent to their condition , but upon the barbarous and wicked computation of how long they can be tortured to profit ; in neither of these cases can the cruelty be imputed to the servant whom you meet upon the road , struggling to perform the unjust commands of his employer . The master is the obvious culprit ; `` respondeat superior ; '' the spectators and the servant are the witnesses ; and these are the cases where an indictment would operate as a most useful example , without oppression to those who thus offend systematically against every principle of humanity and justice . On the other hand , when no cruel commands are given to the servant , but his own malice offends at once against his master and the unhappy animal which he wickedly abuses , he of course is alone responsible ; and these are the cases in which a summary jurisdiction would be most generally resorted to , as more fa- 569 vourable at once to the disinterested informer and to the offender , who would be thus punished with a small penalty , and be delivered from an expensive prosecution.—The other house of parliament will no doubt accomplish this in the further progress of the bill . But in neither of these cases , which comprehend indeed every abuse which the bill extends to , is there any kind of danger that it will work oppression , or produce uncertainty in decision.—A man can not , if an owner , be the subject of an indictment , because he may have been less considerate and merciful than he ought to be ; nor if a servant , for an unreasonable blow of temper upon an unmanageable charge . No , my lords . Every indictment or information before a magistrate must charge the offence , to be committed maliciously , and with wanton cruelty , and the proof must correspond with the charge . This bill makes no act whatever a misdemeanor that does not plainly indicate to the court or magistrate a malicious and wicked intent ; but this generality is so far from generating uncertainty , that I appeal to every member in our great profession , whether , on the contrary , it is not in favour of the accused , and analogous to our most merciful principles of criminal justice ? So far from involving the magistrate in doubtful discriminations , he must be himself shocked and disgusted before he begins to exercise his authority over another . He must find malicious cruelty ; and what that is can never be a matter of uncertainty or doubt , because nature has erected a standard in the human heart , by which it may be surely ascertained.—This consideration surely removes every difficulty from the last clause , which protects from wilful , malicious , and wanton cruelty , all reclaimed animals . Whatever may be the creatures which , by your own voluntary act , you choose to take from the wilds which nature has allotted to them , you must be supposed to exercise this admitted dominion , for use ,
