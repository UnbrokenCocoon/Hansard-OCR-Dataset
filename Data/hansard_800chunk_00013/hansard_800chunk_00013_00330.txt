The whole of the Loan for the year was fourteen millions six hundred thousand pounds , of which three millions were for Ireland , and six hundred thousand pounds for the Prince Regent of Portugal , so that the Loan for the service of England was 11,000,000l . This Loan had been taken in part in the 4 per cents , partly in the 3 per cents , and partly in the Long Annuities . The particulars for every 100l . subscribed were , 4 per Cents £·60 0 0 3 per Cents 60 0 0 Lone Annuities 0 8 10 The amount of interest that would thus be paid on each 100l . by the public , cal- 533 culating it upon the present prices of the respective funds in which the Loan was contracted for , would be 4l . 12s . 10d . a rate of interest , at which the public had never before been able to borrow money—a rate at which it was hardly possible for any individual , however well secured , or prompt his payment might be , to procure a loan . It was not amiss to state in this place the terms upon which , according to the Convention entered into with the Prince Regent of Portugal , the loan of six hundred thousand pounds to that prince was to be secured both as to the payment of interest , and one per cent , sinking fund and the repayment of the principal . The funds which had been assigned for that purpose consisted of the revenues of the island of Madeira , together with a consignment of such produce of the Brazils as belonged to the Prince Regent to his agents in this country , which property was to be placed under the management of these agents , and the proceeds appropriated to the payment of the interest and sinking fund , and the liquidation of the principal of the loan.—It would be in the recollection of the house , that in a former part of the session he had submitted a proposition for funding eight millions of Exchequer Bills , which proposition had received the sanction of that house . Though this operation had not proceeded to the full extent , which he then expected , he was yet happy to be able to state to the Committee , that the sum which had actually been funded under the bill of the present session , amounted , within a fraction , to the sum originally proposed , being not less than 7,932,100l . It became his duty on this occasion to state to the Committee , that the capital created by that operation amounted in the 5 per cents to 7,87 7,308l . ; in the 3 per cents , 386,336l . ; amounting in the whole to capital created 8,253,654l . The total charge for management and sinking fund upon this capital was 495,221l . The total charge upon the loan was 651,345l . making the grand total charge upon both operations 1,146,566l.—It might be satisfactory to the house that he should here make a comparison between the terms upon which the money had been raised for the service of last year , and those upon which he had been able to effect the loan , and provide the other ways and means for the service of the present year . The amount of Exchequer Bills funded last year did not exceed four millions , and had been funded at an interest of 5l , 4s . 9¼d . 534 with a sinking fund charge of 1l . 1s . 2½d . per cent , making together a charge of 6l . 5s . 11¾d . The interest on the Exchequer Bills funded this year was 5l . 3s 1½d . which with a charge for sinking fund of
