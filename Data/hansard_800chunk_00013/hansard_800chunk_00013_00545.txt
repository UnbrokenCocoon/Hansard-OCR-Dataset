His grace begged , however , to state , that with respect to the Licences alluded to , the bishops had no power whatever . concurred in most of what had fallen from the preceding speakers . His lordship thought the matter of the highest consequence . He held in his hand a printed letter to the late archbishop of Canterbury , calling upon his grace 's interference ; and stating , out of not a large number of persons receiving Licences , that seven or eight of them spelt the word `` Gospel '' differently ; and as many others made their mark , instead of signing their names , on paying their shilling for a licence under the Toleration Act . expressed his desire to see every thing done that could be done in favour of the established church , and hoped that something might be done to prevent those abuses that wire practised on the Toleration Act , by which men who never intended to preach or teach took advantage of that liberal enactment , to avoid that civil or military service which no conscientious or religious person would take such means to avoid . said it was not his wish to oppose the increase of salary intended to the judges ; but he gave notice that he should , in the progress of the bill , take the liberty of suggesting to the house some propositions on the subject , and particularly for preventing the sale of the office of clerk of assize , and also for preventing the Welsh Judges from holding other places of profit under the crown , and from occupying seats in parliament , both of which 859 he considered as incompatible with the independent and impartial administration of justice , as well as with the principle upon which the judges of England held their appointments . There was another point to which also he should take occasion to advert ; namely , the great grievance under which the remote parts of the kingdom , and particularly the county of York , laboured under from the delay of justice , as being only visited by the judges of assize once in a year , and that only for a week ; a circumstance extremely oppressive , not only to suitors in that great county , but to all persons there awaiting the course of justice , civil or criminal . said , that the judges , on going a circuit , certainly allotted by anticipation the time they should remain at the different towns on their respective circuits , according to their calculation of the time the business to be done at each would probably occupy ; sometimes certainly the business occupied more time than they expected , and , rendered it impracticable to accomplish the whole , consistently with their arrangements made for other places ; this , however , seldom happened ; and where it was conceived the business would occupy more than the ordinary time , two judges went to York instead of one , whereby double the business was disposed of within the same period . It would be for the wisdom of parliament to make such arrangements on this head as might seem necessary hereafter ; but he hoped the house would not clog the present bill by such regulations . coincided in the necessity of rendering all the judges equally independent of the crown with those of England , and therefore agreed in the propriety of precluding them from seats in parliament , as well as from other lucrative offices under the crown , in order that they might not only be removed from the influence of the crown in that house , but even from the suspicion of it ; and he thought that a clause for this purpose , as well as for preventing the sale of the office of clerk of assize , ought to be inserted in the bill . deprecated the idea of precluding the Welch judges from seats in that house , under any idea of their dependence on the crown , their places being for life . By such
