Henry Petty ) has taken a wrong view of the subject : â€”such a committee would not be furnished with the power of accusation ; the members of that committee would not become the public accusers ; their province would be simply to investigate ; and having investigated , to report , where they should see occasion , matter of accusation , subject to the consideration and decision of the house of commons . For my own part , I must sin- 57 cerely wish that I could feel a doubt , whether matter of accusation would probably be found by such a committee ; but I deeply lament the necessity I am under of stating my firm belief , that there would be found much matter and strong ground for accusation , in instances almost innumerable ; and I greatly fear , that on a general investigation , practices of a nature most corrupt , would be found to exist in departments where their existence can not even have been dreamt of by the public . Sir , I will venture to assert , that by such an inquiry , practices would be brought to light , the exposure and punishment of which are the only means by which you can continue a safe government , such as you now are . My noble friend has reminded us of two special instances of general inquiry , from which no beneficial effects were found to result . But there is a question which , determine as we may , the public will very naturally ask ; and that is , whether in the progress of those inquiries , when the committees touched on some fact of magnitude , so great that it ought to have been exposed , and laid bare to the view of art expecting and indignant public ; they will , I say , naturally ask , whether the committees did not on those occasions blink the question ? if , sir , those committees neglected to do their duty , I can not hold that to be an argument why we should shrink from the performance of that duty which we owe to the people , by whom vie are , or ought to be , sent into this house . There is , I admit , a very powerful reason for minute caution in scrutinizing the qualities of those whom we may appointon that committee ; but whatever danger may be apprehended by the appointment of such a committee , and with such general powers , and which committee seems to be so greatly the object of terror , it is my firm conviction that the refusal or hesitation of this house to grant and even promote a general inquiry into those abuses , of the existence of which the people are impressed with so firm a conviction , will be attended with danger paramount to any that can be suggested by the apprehensions of those gentlemen who oppose the motion of the noble lord . Whatever may be the extent of their apprehensions of danger , I can not but think that an investigation of the abuses existing , or which are suspected to have existed , is of the highest importance to the welfare and tranquillity of the country ; and it is my unqualified opinion , 58 that nothing can so certainly allay the ferment which has been raised in the minds of the people , as that the true colour of every transaction , whether black or white , should be displayed . If black , let exposure and punishment follow ; if white , let us have the satisfaction of displaying to the nation the purity and innocence of those into whose conduct inquiry has been instituted . With these views , and for these reasons , I shall certainly support by my vote the motion of the noble lord . remarked , that the house had certainly something to complain of with respect to the proceeding of the noble lord , who had not given a notice of that specific nature which the magnitude of the case required .
