different sorts , â€”some from folly , and some from wickedness ; some because they know not what they are about , some because they do know ; some as knaves and more as dupes ; many from motives of interest , and more from motives of passion ; some because they hate one part of the establishment , and others because they hate another ; some as mere fanatics , and because they have entangled their ( commonly ) moderate understandings in speculations to which they are wholly unequal ; others from mere restlessness and love of something to do ; but far the greater part , from some species of bad passion or other , ( not excluding of course those most powerful and general ones , vanity and love of distinction , ) are desirous of seeing some great change in the order of things as they find it established : not all of them by any means desiring a change of the same sort or to the same extent : Oh , no ! but all of them a change suited to their several views , and proportioned to their several interests and situations . My hon . friend , the author of the measure , and a great landed proprietor , thinks that there would be signal advantage in a change which would throw more weight into the scale of the landed interest . Another hon . friend of mine , likewise a great landed proprietor , is of opinion , that those , who can only purchase their seats , are intent upon nothing but getting back their money . To these are opposed many gentlemen of the monied interest , who see no reason , ( nor do I , I confess , see any ) why they who may have paid a sum for their seats once for all , should be more desirous of getting back their money , than he who has spent that sum , or three times as much , in a contested popular election . I am far , too , from being convinced from any observations that I have made of the conduct of men in parliament , that such in point of fact is the case . To my apprehension many of those who may be suspected to have come into parliament through these condemned and reprobated ways , have been among the most upright , honourable , and independent member 's , that parliament has had to boast , fair exceeding others that could be named , who from the money they have spent , and the interests they have staked , in elections pretending to be of higher account , have only brought themselves to be the mere 751 slaves of popular opinion , that is to say , of their own future hopes , in the places which they represent . Many of the former description , from the class to which for the most part they belong , will be of opinion , probably , that the best improvement would be that which conspires best with the general change in the circumstances of the country , and by taking something from the old and obsolete privileges of the landed aristocracy , the barbarous remains of feudal times , gives a free scope to men who owe their wealth , not to dull hereditary descent , but to their own enterprize and industry , and have grown rich by means that have at the same time enriched , or otherwise benefited the country . But there is a third and more numerous class , who looking with no very friendly eye to advantages which they do not share , and knowing that they have not either land or money , yet fully persuaded that they have talents , will be for levelling to the ground all those barriers , which have hitherto , as they are firmly convinced , been the sole obstacles to their advancement , and have alone hindered them from figuring in the first situations of the state . The general rule will , I believe , be ,
