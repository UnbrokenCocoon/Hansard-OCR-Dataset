. To this view of it , founded on the circumstances under which it took place , and on the boundless ambition , and known character of the ruler of France , he had endeavoured in the years 1803 and 1804 , to adapt our expenditure , and the system by which it was to be provided for . The former , though complained of at the time , as being restricted within the limits of a too rigid œconomy , had nevertheless been found fully sufficient , not only , for the purpose of complete domestic security , but for more extensive foreign conquests than had ever been made in the first year of any former war : and the latter , the objects of which were to prevent , by the operation of the sinking fund , combined with the imposition of war taxes to an unexampled amount , any considerable addition to the public debt , or permanent taxes , was carried into immediate effect by the firmness of parliament , seconded by the ardent zeal and fortitude of the people . The conviction had become universal , that the renewal of war was solely occasioned by the restless and insatiable ambition of the enemy , and accordingly the truth of what was said by Mr. Burke , that the pecuniary moans of a country , which were accessible by taxation , consisted not merely of what it possessed , but of what it would consent to pay , was never more completely illustrated than at that memorable period . War taxes to the amount of upwards of twelve millions , were imposed by parliament with little , or no opposition in either house , and submitted to without complaint by the people ; although an addition of near one hundred millions to the public debt , and of near five millions to the permanent taxes had been made in the year 1802 , for the purposes of funding the sum , for which the income tax had been mortgaged , and of 907 winding up the arrears , of the war . That this system was eminently successful , was manifest from the fact , that , with a loan of ten millions only , the provision for the first year of the war proved not only adequate to its expenditure , but , as appeared from a resolution passed by the house of commons after he had quitted office , to be also sufficient , ( supposing the war had then terminated , ) to liquidate the whole of the funded and unfunded debt incurred during that year , and to leave a surplus of upwards of two millions to the disposal of parliament.—In the subsequent year ( 1804 ) the loan was for no more than ten millions : but as an increase of expence had taken place , he had proposed , and parliament had adopted , the measure , of adding one million to the war taxes ; a measure directly opposite to that of the present year , by which , even under the pressure of increased expenditure , one million was to be withdrawn from that fund . The great object he had in view , was to arrive at the point where the sum borrowed , would be balanced by the sum to be redeemed in the same year ; after which , if there was no additional expenditure , the public service would be carried on with a diminishing , instead of an en-creasing debt . It was however at that time , and continued to be his decided opinion , that , if an addition to the expenditure became necessary , it ought to be provided for by an addition to the revenue , so that the great object of preventing a permanent accumulation of debt might be effectually accomplished . He acknowledged it to be also his opinion , that , when the sum borrowed could by the amount of war taxes , be brought within the limits of the sum redeemed it would be warrantable and wise to leave the interest of the sum annually
