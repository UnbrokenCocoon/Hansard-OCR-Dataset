, and suggested , that the best plan would be to leave it to ministers to make up the accounts according to the scope of the motions , in the best manner they could ; and if the Returns were not satisfactory the hon . gent . might renew his motions next session . Mr. Wardle assented to this , and all the motions were agreed to . spoke to the following effect : ; I feel myself bound in 1132 the first place to acknowledge the candour and liberality of the Gentlemen opposite , by whom I have been furnished with every official assistance which could diminish the trouble of preparing the Resolutions which I am about to submit to the house , or render them more correct and perfect . This is not only a great satisfaction to me , for many obvious reasons , but especially so , because it will spare the House the trouble of any minute investigation of the details of the Accounts , which would be not only irksome and tedious in itself , but might divert their attention from those principal points to which I wish their consideration to be directed . Whether those Gentlemen may concur with me or not , in the inferences which I may draw from the facts I shall bring forward , no dispute can arise on the accuracy of the facts themselves . I have , however , still greater satisfaction in believing , from intimations which have been given me , that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is disposed to concur in the whole of the Resolutions which I shall propose . This will not only enable me to abridge the statement into which I shall be obliged to enter ; but is much more important , as affording a presumption that , however the Right Honourable Gentleman may have departed in the arrangements of the present year , from those principles which I think wise and salutary in Finance ; he has done so under the real or supposed pressure of some occasional circumstances , and not from any fixed or systematic difference of opinion . At the time that in stating the Finance arrangements of the year , he disclosed his intention of charging the greatest part of the Loan on the War Taxes , I felt and intimated , that it would be impossible for me to acquiesce in such an arrangement , without remonstrance . On some occasions , when the subject might have been properly discussed , I was prevented , by private circumstances , from attending ; but , I also felt , that considerable advantages would attend the mode of proceeding now adopted . If I had opposed the Bill for charging the War Taxes , with much more eloquence and ability than belong to me , it might have been difficult for the Right Honourable Gentleman , even if he had seen the force of my reasons , to have agreed to my conclusion , After having intimated in the Speech from the Throne , and deliberately proposed in his Budget , that no 1133 new taxes should be brought forward for the service of the year ; he might not easily have persuaded the Country to acquiesce in the imposition of taxes , which might be found burdensome ; and , which his proposed measures had shewn to have been in his opinion , unnecessary and inexpedient . Nor could I overlook the objections which must occur to a great prolongation of the sitting of Parliament , which might probably have been the consequence of such a change of system . But , I hoped , that by adopting the present mode of proceeding , and entering upon a discussion not immediately connected with any practical measure , but rather in the nature of an historical review of measures already past , though recent ; we should reason with cooler minds , and be much more likely to agree in a result which might at least prevent the repetition of any injurious practice , if not lead to the immediate remedy of mischiefs already effected .
