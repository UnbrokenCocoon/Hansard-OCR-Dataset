to which Deacon 's orders could not be conferred , or of whose moral characters and conduct satisfactory attestations had not been adduced . It was also highly desireable , ( and surely it would not be deemed unreasonable , or improper to require , ) that persons claiming Licences to preach should state , if not the grounds of their , dissent , the denomination , at least , of Dissenters to which they professed to belong ; that they should be recommended by the religious society of which they were members ; that they should be attached to a known and distinct place of public worship ; and that they should not be at liberty to officiate habitually elsewhere without afresh Licence.â€”Whether these or any other regulations should be adopted , it would be for the wisdom of their lordships , and of the other house of parliament , to determine : but it appeared to be due to that profession of faith , concerning the fundamental doctrines of which we were all agreed , that no subordinate differences of opinion should allow us to be regardless of the qualifications and characters of those by whom religious instruction was to be conveyed . With respect to the tenets of the various sects of Dissenters , we had , indeed , no right to interfere : but to endeavour that , be they what they may , they should not be preached and taught by the grossly ignorant and the profligate , was surely no infringement on the sound principles of an enlightened toleration . That the number of persons who frequent meeting houses , and conventicles had , within the last few years , considerably increased , could not be denied : but it was not to be supposed that the number of dissenters had increased in the same proportion . He believed the fact to be , that the awful occurrences of the last twenty years had created a more general sense of the truths , and importance of religion than was previously entertained ; and that whilst these impressions were spreading , and the population of the country rapidly increasing , the number of places of worship under the established church , of clergymen engaged in the performance of parochial duties , remained nearly the same . Many persons were therefore induced to prefer an attendance in conventicles , and meeting houses , to a neglect of public worship altogether . By an Address to his majesty 856 with a view to the improvement of small Benefices , to which their lordship 's had unanimously agreed on the preceeding day , a step had been taken , which amongst its other advantages tended to obviate one of the causes of apparent separation from the church ; inasmuch as the inducement to unite many small livings for the purpose of affording a decent subsistence , would be weakened , as the actual value of each was materially improved ; and thus whilst the number of pluralists was diminished , that of the resident efficient clergy would be increased . But the great and most effectual check to the progress of Schism , as proceeding from the causes to which he had adverted , must be derived from an augmentation of the number of churches properly endowed , to which all persons should have access . Proprietary chapels would in no degree answer the purpose , unless it were enacted , as he thought it ought to be , by the authority of parliament , that for a certain proportion of the Aiea of places of public worship to be consecrated in future , no pew rent should be taken . He was however of opinion that the charge of providing additional places of worship , where an increased population appeared to require them , ought in part to be defrayed by local contributions , and not be thrown exclusively on the public . To these objects , he trusted that the attention of government , and of parliament would be speedily and earnestly directed : it was a duty of primary , indispensable , and urgent importance
