state , and see from what they originate , and in what manner they are brought forward . A gentleman at the eve of a general election , or on some vacancy in a borough or county , is addressed by some one who is , or , who , he hopes , will be his constituent , some full-grown manufacturer , or opulent brewer , or attorney in great practice , who says , 'You know my son Tom , who is in the navy . He has been for some time a lieutenant , I should be very glad , if you would get him made Master and Commander . ' The candidate or member bows assent , ( Mr. Such-a-one is not a man to be disobliged , ) he speaks to his friend the minister ; the minister speaks to the first Lord of the Admiralty , and , without further inquiry the thing is done ; nobody being able to divine , of those who are not in the secret , and only know our son Tom professionally , for which of his good qua- 759 lities or meritorious actions he has been made , so much out of his turn , and over the heads of so many old and deserving officers , a master and commander.â€”Here then is a complete job , passing through several successive stages , and disgraceful enough in its progress to all the parties concerned in it , including the member , the minister , and the first Lord of the Admiralty , but certainly not ex-eluding the constituent , the corrupt constituent , who is no member of the government high or low , but one of the people , and the prime author and mover of the whole . When this constituent shall hereafter reproach his member , as one of a body that is all corrupt , composed of persons who think of nothing but their own interests , without any regard to the interest of the country , the member may possibly be able to reply : `` The most corrupt act I ever was guilty of was that scandalous job by which I bought your vote and interest , when , contrary to all right and justice , I procured your son to be made a master and commander . '' We have here the history of a job , which though springing from a root , that lies totally among the people , is supposed not to confine itself to the place of its original growth , but to extend into the parliament , and into the executive government . With a view , however , of shewing the temper of some of these declaimers against abuses , let us take another case , ( not more difficult , I hope , to be met with ) , when , after inquiry made , either the member , or the minister , or the first Lord of the Admiralty has virtue enough to say , that the pretensions and merits of the person in question are so small , and the injustice of promoting him would be so great , that in spite of all the wish that one of them necessarily has to promote his own success , and the others may have to promote the success of an important parliamentary friend and adherent , and much as it may even be their duty to promote by all honest means the success of one , whose conduct in parliament is likely to be what they think right , they feel it impossible to comply with the application that has been made . Is it quite certain , is it quite a matter of course that the author of the . application , this inveigher against the corruptions of the times , is satisfied with this answer ; that he does not turn away with a sulky look from his late friend , and without disputing at all the truth of the reasons on which the refusal is founded , of which he perhaps was more fully aware than any 760 other person
