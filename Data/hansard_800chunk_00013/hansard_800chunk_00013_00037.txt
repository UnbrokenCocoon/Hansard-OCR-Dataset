moment , and would oppose the further progress of this bill . The question being loudly called for , the gallery was cleared , but the Amendment was agreed to without a division . desired that the Report of a Committee appointed in 1804 , to enquire into the State of Ireland , as to its Circulating Paper , its Specie , and current coin , and the Exchange between that part of the United Kingdom and Great Britain , should be read , and the same having been entered by the clerk as read , the hon . gent . addressed the house as follows ; — ; I rise , Sir , for the purpose of moving that the house do resolve itself into a committee of the whole house , to take this Report into consideration ; and if the house shall think proper to accede to this motion , I shall then submit to the committee the following Resolution : `` That it is expedient that the Coin of the United Kingdom shall be of the same standard and value as the Coin now is of Great Britain . `` —It appears to me , Sir , that the difference which now exists between the currencies of Great Britain and Ireland contributes to keep alive a feeling of separation and distinction between the inhabitants of these countries , very inconsistent with their mutual prosperity : that it gives a character to the respective parts of the United Kingdom that belongs rather to countries foreign to each other than to members of the same community , a character by no means belonging to the spirit of real union and the true interests of the peo- 76 ple . I have always considered the Act of Union as very imperfect , because it did not provide for the assimilation of the coin ; and though I opposed that measure , and now think that it ought to be repealed , if the expectations which the people of Ireland were taught to entertain of its beneficial consequences are for ever to be disappointed , still I am desirous to do every thing that can be done to establish unanimity and identity , between the two countries , and therefore I wish to see the difference in the currencies completely done away.—Another bad consequence of this difference , is the restraint that it imposes upon the commercial intercourse of the two countries ; a restraint very inconsistent with that perfect freedom of trade , which is necessary , in order that trade may be carried on to the greatest possible advantage . For though the operation of converting sums of one currency into sums of the other is a very simple one , and to those accustomed to it may present no difficulty whatever , still it necessarily must be to all others the source of doubts , respecting the results of any commercial speculation connected with Ireland in which they may embark , and therefore it must contribute to deter many from undertaking such speculations , however strong the probability of their success might be , if the local circumstances , and national resources of Ireland were alone taken into consideration . I therefore feel that there is good ground for stating , that this difference does form an obstruction of very considerable effect to the free circulation of the capital , labour , and industry of these countries , and , consequently , ought to be removed.—But the principal inconvenience that results from the present state of the currencies is , in my opinion , the existence of an Exchange between them : such a thing not being known ever to exist between any two places that have a circulating currency common to both of them . * I shall endeavour to support this opinion by an examination of the causes of fluctuations of exchange , and by reference to such authorities as ought to have considerable weight in the house upon this subject.—Exchange between London and Dublin is considered to be at par , when a bill for 100l. , payable in London , will * The
