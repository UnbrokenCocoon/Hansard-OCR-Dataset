that at a time when the Spanish government was undisturbed , when the attacking army was to be aided by a friendly country in its rear , and had consequently no precaution to take for the security of retreat in case of failure , to what degree would not the difficulties be increased by the actual state of Spain at the present moment ? —His lordship said , he stated this in order to justify an opinion he had long entertained , that if the resources of Portugal had been wisely applied , the spirit of the people encouraged , a government established that was calculated to inspire their confidence , and an army , such as sir John Moore had commanded , sent for their protection , not only would that country have been rendered impregnable against any efforts the French could have made under the present circumstances , but the foundation laid of affording the most effectual support to the Spaniards which could be derived from external co-operation.—If , in the month of August , a blow could have been struck at the French army upon the Ebro , much might have been done to have prevented the disasters of the last campaign ; but as his majesty 's ministers had not judged it advisable to adopt that measure , Portugal was the point to which every national hope was directed , and where , indeed , advantages did actually present themselves of a nature so important and so evident , that it is utterly inconceivable how they should have escaped the notice of his majesty 's ministers.—His lordship said , he should then proceed to that part of his subject which embraced the conduct which had been pursued in Portugal , founded upon the events that had taken place in that country.—It had appeared in papers before the house , that previous to the arrival of sir Arthur Wellesley with the force under his command , the disposition 282 of the people of Portugal to resist the French , had been manifested in the most unquestionable manner . Sir Arthur Wellesley , speaking of the situation in which he found that country , says , `` In respect to Portugal , the whole kingdom , with the exception of the neighbourhood of Lisbon , is in a state of insurrection against the French . The means of resistance are , however , less powerful than those of the Spaniards . Their troops had been completely dispersed , the officers had gone off to the Brazils , and their arsenals pillaged , or in the power of the enemy ; and their revolt under the circumstances in winch it has taken place more extraordinary than that of the Spanish nation . '' To these exertions they had been urged not only by their own feelings , but by the proclamation of sir Charles Cotton , dated the 4th of July , 1808 , who thus addressed them : — '' Some months experience must convince you of the effect of French friendship . It is now to British faith and assistance , aided by your own energy and efforts , that you will , I trust , be indebted for the restoration of your prince , and independence of your country . '' Thus called upon , such was the attachment of the Portuguese people to their prince , such was their sense of the oppression they were suffering from the French , and such was their reliance `` on British faith and assistance , '' that in the month of July the provinces of Entre-Minho-y-Douro , Beira , and Tra-los-Montes , as well as Algarva , comprehending more than hall the population of Portugal , were in a state of insurrection against the existing government . This was the situation of things when sir Arthur Wellesley landed , and which enabled him , with a force not otherwise equal to the attempt , to move forward for the purpose of meeting the enemy in the vicinity of Lisbon . The insurrection in Algarva had obliged Junot to detach six thousand men under Loisson , in order to
