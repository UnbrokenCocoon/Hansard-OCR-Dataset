enemy arrived in the vicinity of Oporto . On the 27th they made some warm attacks , which were repulsed by the intrepidity of our troops . They continued their attacks on the following day with the same success , but on the 29th , the distrust which had arisen between the people and the army causing and increasing that anarchy and 286 confusion which it ever produces , rendered ineffectual all the endeavours of the officers , as well Portuguese as English , to direct the operations of the great force which was in the city . The enemy entered with little loss . Much as the marshal regrets the loss of this important city , he feels with more acuteness the alarming cause to which it is to be attributed . Let it be a warning to the rest of the kingdom to avoid the fatal consequence of anarchy and insubordination . The marshal hopes that the army will perceive that we ought always to distrust those who have been with the French , or their partisans , and what reports they may propagate , as they are undoubtedly paid by the enemy to promote confusion and distress , the arms of which they make the most dangerous use . `` —His lordship said he had drawn the attention of their lordships to these orders , for the purpose of bringing the actual situation of Portugal more immediately under their observation : a situation the more alarming , because whilst so important a conquest had been made by Marshal Soult in the north , a great army under Marshal Victor was threatening that country from the east . At such a crisis every thing might depend upon the promptitude , the judgment , and the energy of the Commander-in-chief.—Lord Buckinghamshire said he knew sir John Craddock well enough to be quite confident that nothing could abate his zeal , or check his exertions in the advancement of the public service ; but at such a conjuncture , when all the faculties of the human mind were called into action , when the most splendid military talents might be unequal to the task of extricating his majesty 's troops from the difficulties with which they were surrounded , it was seriously to be lamented , that the general upon whom so much depended , should act under the knowledge that he had been superseded by an officer many years his junior in the army.—That the approbation of all the measures he had pursued in Portugal , under circumstances of extreme difficulty , and his acknowledged gallantry and approved exertions in Martinique , in Ireland , and in Egypt , had not been sufficient to protect him from so severe a mortification.—His lordship said he could not avoid remarking , in this place , upon the peculiar talent the present administration possessed , by the most ingenious contrivances , so to form their military arrangements that at the most critical periods they should never 287 have the full benefit of the abilities of the officers employed by them ; for under the hourly expectation of supercession , or under the controul of a presumptuous and inconsiderate interference , the human mind was incapable of those efforts by which alone great military achievements could be accomplished . The instances of sir Arthur Wellesley , when engaged in the operations against Junot , sir John Moore in Spain , and sir John Craddock at present , his lordship said , would fully illustrate the force of his observation.—Lord Buckinghamshire then proceeded to express ( as not totally unconnected with the subject under discussion , ) the satisfaction he had derived from the appointment of the marquis Wellesley to the Spanish embassy.—He dwelt upon the services he had rendered the British empire in India ; the manner in which he had conducted the operations of the wars that had broken out during his administration in that country ; the foresight , energy , and judgment he had displayed , and whatever differences might have arisen upon other points , the universál applause and admiration with which his military measures had been distinguished.—Was he
