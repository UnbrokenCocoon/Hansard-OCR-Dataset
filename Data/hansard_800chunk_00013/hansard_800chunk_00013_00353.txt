without trouble and expence . The law is , therefore , more open to the charge of inefficacy than of vexation.—It can indeed have no operation except when compassionate men ( and I trust they will become more numerous from the moral sense which this Bill is calculated to awaken ) , shall set the law in motion against manifest and disgusting offenders , to deliver themselves from the pain and horror which the immediate view of wilful and wanton cruelty is capable of exciting , or is rather sure to excite in a generous nature.—What possible difficulty , then , can be imposed upon the magistrate , who has only to judge upon hearing , from his own human feelings , what such disinterested informers have judged of from having seen 567 and felt . The task is surely most easy , and by no means novel . Indeed , the whole administration of law , in many analogous cases , consists in nothing else but in discriminations generally more difficult in cases of personal wrongs . Cruelty to an apprentice , by beating , or over labour , is judged of daily upon the very principle which this Bill will bring into action in the case of an oppressed animal.—To distinguish the severest discipline to command obedience , and to enforce activity in such dependents from brutal ferocity and cruelty , never yet puzzled a judge or a jury , never at least in my very long experience ; and when want of sustenance is the complaint , the most culpable over-frugality is never confounded with a wicked and malicious privation of food.—The same distinctions occur frequently , upon the plea of moderate chastisement , when any other servant complains of his master , or when it becomes necessary to measure the degree of violence , which is justifiable in repelling violence , or in the preservation of rights . In the same manner the damage from a frivolous assault or of a battery , the effect of provocation or sudden temper , is daily distinguished in our courts , from a severe and cold-blooded outrage . A hasty word , which just conveys matter that is actionable , is in the same manner distinguished in a moment from malignant and dangerous slander . Mistakes in the extent of authority , which happen every day in the discharge of the complicated duties of the magistracy , are never confounded for a moment , even when they have trenched severely upon personal liberty , with an arbitrary and tyrannous imprisonment . Unguarded or slight trespasses upon property , real or personal , are in the same way the daily subjects of distinction from malicious deprivations of rights , or serious interruptions of their enjoyment.—Similar , or rather nicer distinctions , are occurring daily in our courts ; when Libel or no Libel is the question . A line must be drawn between injurious calumny , and fair , though perhaps unpleasant animadversion ; but plain good sense without legal subtlety is sure to settle it with justice ; so every man may enjoy what is his own , but not to the injury of his neighbour . What is an injury , or what only a loss , without being injurious , is the question in all cases or nuisance , and they are satisfactorily settled by the common understandings and feelings of mankind . 568 My lords , there would be no end of these analogies , if I were to pursue them ; I might bring my whole professional life , for near thirty years , in review before your lordships.—I appeal to the learned lords of the house , whether these distinctions are not of daily occurrence ; I appeal to my noble and learned friend on the woolsack , whether , when he sat as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas , he found any difficulty in these distinctions ; I appeal to my noble and learned friend , who sits just by him , whose useful and valuable life is wholly occupied amidst these questions , whether they are doubtful and dangerous in the
