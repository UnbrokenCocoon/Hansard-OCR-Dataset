, owing to the suggestions , of the petitioner , very great retrenchments took place in the barrack department ; and , amongst other circumstances , the vent of the temporary barracks hired upon the part of government were reduced nearly one half , and others given up as useless ; and that at the time the petitioner was induced to point out the-above-mentioned abuses to the Secretary at War he stated the disagreeable predicament in which such a proceeding would inevitably place him if he was suffered to remain under the immediate controul of those who were implicated in the transactions he complained of , and upon this ground he solicited a removal from the Isle of Wight to a similar appointment then vacant at Deal , but such solicitation was not attended to , end he was left singly to contend against an host of enemies , whose frauds he had been the means of detecting , and after suffering various mortifications he was turned out of his situation , having a numerous family to support , without even having been acquainted with any accusation alledged against him ; and that the petitioner was informed at length through anc- 1160 ther channel , that the cause of his dismissal was an affidavit produced against him by a proprietor of one of the barns then hired , by government as a temporary barrack , and about to be given up , at the petitioner 's recommendation , on account of an exorbitant rent paid for it ; and the petitioner being denied the advantage of a fair trial , he instantly adopted the only means ill his power of rebutting such affidavit , namely , by a counter affidavit ; and the petitioner conceives that , if an inference is to be drawn out of these affidavits , printed by order of the last parliament , his character will stand acquitted , inasmuch as those in his favour are the joint depositions of three persons , and state a connected chain of circumstances , whereas the one exhibited against him is the assertion of an individual , avowedly his enemy , and an interested person ; and that the petitioner humbly requests a fair and open investigation , whereon he undertakes not only to manifest his own innocence , but to substantiate charges of a most criminal nature against one or more persons who are now unworthily filling situations of public trust ; and that by reference to the Fourth Report of the Commissioners of Military Enquiry , it will appear great rents are paid for buildings or barns , and regarding which there is contradictory evidence ; and that the petitioner offered to substantiate the above charges upon oath before the commissioners of military enquiry , but as that tribunal would not accede to the proposal of the petitioner , to allow him to be present at examination of witnesses , or permit counsel on his behalf , or allow him to call on such evidence as the petitioner requested , and which he conceived necessary , he was deprived of all reasonable expectation or hope of redress , and consequently he was induced to decline the further prosecution of the charges ; and praying that the House will take his unfortunate case into consideration , and afford him such relief as the justice thereof shall be thought to require .
