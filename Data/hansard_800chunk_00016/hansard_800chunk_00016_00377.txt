king and fidelity to the constitution , prescribed by the statutes of 1774 and 1793 , and universally taken by all the Irish Catholics . And lastly , the strong and incontrovertible evidence , which every successive relaxation of the penal code has continued to furnish , of the conviction of the legislature , encreasing and confirmed , respecting the assured loyalty and perfect trustworthiness of the king 's Irish Catholic subjects , as members of the Protestant state . To the claims of the Petitioners , founded on such titles as these , to a full particiation with themselves in every constitutional privilege and capacity , what were the objections which he was to anticipate ? If arguments were to be counted , and not weighed , the cause of the Catholics would indeed be hopeless ; nothing had been left unsaid against them , which human ingenuity could suggest , or credulity itself affect to believe—imputations the most unfounded—charges , the most contradictory—idle doubts , and causeless apprehensions , have continued to mark the lingering retreat of prejudice and bigotry , and 653 the slow and impeded march of truth , wisdom , and philosophy . Was it fitting that he should exhaust their lordships ' patience by a repetition of all those calumnies which have issued forth , at the appointed seasons in the shape of arguments , in strong array , against the Petitioners ? and which , though beaten down by evidence the most convincing and conclusive , they had seen return to the charge again and again . Must he be prepared to demonstrate , by a regular chain of proofs , that the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church do not enjoin or justify , in any possible case , the breach of that sacred obligation which binds man to man , and is the strongest cement of human society—that Catholics are not , of necessity , and from the very nature of the religious ' opinions which they profess , faithless members in every Protestant community—that they are not bound to the subversion of that property , the present arrangement of which they feel to be their own best title and security ; nor to the overthrow of those establishments which they had so solemnly sworn that they would never assail ? Could it be necessary that he should consume the time of the House , by pressing again upon their attention , those arguments by which he endeavoured to shew , and he trusted not without some effect , when he had before the honour of addressing their lordships on behalf of the Petitioners , that the so much relied upon Corporation and Test Acts which they had already repealed and modified , from time to time , in favour of Dissenters from the state religion , of every description , are not to beset up , at this day , as insurmountable obstacles against a continuance in the same course of legitimate concession ? And lastly , was he to expect to hear it still resounded in his ears , in the same solemn tones , that , because the settlement of 1688 established the principle of a protestant king , the principle of an exclusively Protestant parliament must , of necessity , be inferred as an inseparable consequence , when they had already recalled the Irish Catholic to his just share in the choice of that representative body , by giving him back the elective franchise ; and whilst his constitutional capacity to hold every civil and military situation had been restored and recognised by the general repeal of all existing disabilities in 1793 , what species of reasoning was it , which would give to the exceptions , created by 654 that act , the quality and character of fundamental exclusions , unchangeable and eternal ? But what , he would ask , were those apprehended dangers against which the penal code was to have afforded us its protection ? If they were to be searched for in the fears of a disputed succession , and the claims of an exiled family , had they not long since
