and he has distinctly stated , that if this bill shall be found ineffectual to support the credit of Bank-notes , it is his intention to make them a legal tender . I am compelled therefore to refuse my assent to the bill , because no disorder in our finances , no disappointment in our plans of external warfare , is equal in danger to the evils of a violation of the sacred law of property , uniformly consequent , in all ages and all countries , on measures like the present . With a view to understand , how far this Bill is calculated to answer its professed purpose , it is material to consider , how the law actually stands ' , and what is the purpose of lord King in the appeal he has made to it . In this House , it is sufficiently known , though not fully understood in other places , that the effect of the ; Restriction act in 1797 , and the other measures connected with it , is to make payments in Bank-notes obligatory on the public creditor alone , by placing him in such a situation , that if he refuses Bank-notes when tendered to him at the Bank ; in payment of his dividend , he can get nothing else . In the acquittal of all obligations between individuals , the wise and salutary maxims of the law are unimpaired , and it is yet the privilege of Englishmen , that in the payment of a debt of twenty shillings , they may refuse all the paper of the Bank of England . Not only is this the wording of the statute , but the case has been solemnly considered and ruled by the unanimous opinion of the four judges of the court of Common Pleas in the instance of Grigby v Oakes . Under these circumstances , lord King has formally announced to the world that he will no longer receive a currency , manifestly depreciated , in discharge of obligations contracted when the nominal and the real value were the same ; and that he will assert his right and seek his remedy in a court of justice . Such is the portentous evil against which we are required to provide by legislative mea- 1041 sures , and now , for the first time , have we heard censure , nay criminality , attached to an appeal to the law , which has hitherto been regarded as our only safeguard and protection . There are some gentlemen , who , disapproving of the Bill generally , do not object to that part of it , by which all process by distress is suspended , on tender being made in Bank-notes ; they deem it expedient that all summary process shall be suspended , by which men may be induced to submit to the demands of lord King ; and consider it essential , that parliament be actually sitting , when the final judgment of the law is pronounced . An hon . friend did put some very pointed questions to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , as to the actual state of the law , but had not the good fortune to receive explanations equally distinct ; yet he must be well aware , that although the process of distress is prompt and efficacious , with a view to secure the landlord from ultimate loss , it does not accelerate the decision of any point of contention , more than the other remedies reserved to lord King , â€”an action on the case , or by ejectment . In every instance of distress , the tenant may replevy , and , on giving security to the sheriff the cause can not be decided , and judgment obtained , in less than two terms : if , therefore , parliament , shall refrain from interference , and lord King remain at liberty to exercise all the powers of distress , the cause can not be tried in Westminster hall until the next term , nor judgment obtained until Hilary term , in January 1812 , or if
