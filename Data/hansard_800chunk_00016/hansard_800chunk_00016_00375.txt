said , he desired that he might not be misunderstood ; in that House he was not afraid of being misrepresented . On the part of the Catholics , he did not urge it as a grievance from which they were weak or wicked enough to seek to be relieved , that the Protestant church was the established religion of the State . He claimed not on their part , and as their advocate , what they had themselves solemly renounced upon oath , a share in the honours or advantages of the established church . He did not mean to recommend `` to the imitation of the petitioners , that system of violence in the pursuit of their object , which however successful in the case of Scotland , he had unequivocally condemned , and from the excesses of which humanity itself recoils with disgust . In making that statement , and in the parallel which he had drawn , his intention had been only this—to endeavour to awake the slumbering feelings of their lordships to a more kind and favourable consideration of the petitioner 's case , from a just recollection of the peculiar grievances by which they had been oppressed ; and of those circumstances of unexampled severity , under which it had been their misfortune to have suffered so long . And here he must be permitted to express the particular satisfaction with which he had received the printed reports of their lordship 's late proceedings on the Petition of the Protestant Dissenters ; having been necessarily detained in the country for the recovery of his health , he was reluctantly prevented from being personally present . No man , however , more cordially approved the decision of the House on that very important discussion , 650 and the respectful deference to the conscientious scruples of other men , however essentially differing from the doctrines and discipline of the Established Church , which marked the whole course of that interesting debate . No voice was raised against these petitioners , as avowed and formidable opponents to the principles and practice of our ecclesiastical establishments—no attempt was made to misrepresent their motives or themselves ; when 500 petitions upon the same subject were heaped upon their lord-ship 's table almost at the same moment , noble lords abstained from that line of argument which he had known resorted to on other similar occasions , when the numbers of the Catholic petitioners had been represented by their parliamentary advocates , as furnishing additional ground , at least , for due and respectful inquiry into the claims of so important a class of their fellow subjects . He might then venture to remind that House , without the fear of being charged with an attempt at intimidation , that he stood before their lordships the unequal advocate of four millions of his country-men , and their fellow subjects—armed in support of the same establishments—in defence of the same gracious King—the joint inheritors with themselves of all the privileges and immunities of the British Constitution . A salutary caution had suggested itself to him from this part of the argument . He addressed it to those , if any such were still to be found in that House , whose per severing hostility to the petition had not been satisfied by the perpetual rejection of every measure of kindness and conciliation which had been offered on their behalf ; who appeared to have considered them selves bound , as it were , by a due regard to their own consistency , to a state of eternal warfare with his Majesty 's Catholic subject , and who had been unable , in their mode of considering this question , to distinguish and separate its intrinsic nature and constitutional bearings from their own rooted prejudices , and those justly reprobated doctrines , which , however disclaimed again and again , under the most solemn sanctions , they are determined stilt to impute , with injustice the most relent less and persevering , to the religion of the great mass of the Christian world . If there should happen to be in that
