of interest to the subscribers on the 3 per cent . loan , was 4l . 14s . 11 d. per cent . ; on the 5 per cent . loan , 5l . 3s . 8¼d . per cent . The difference on the charges being not quite one shilling per cent . and which difference was attributable to the Sinking Fund . The rate per cent . on the whole debt created , paid by the public , was 6l 48 , 3¼d . It was a great satisfaction to him to state that so large a portion of the loan of the year had been funded in the 5 per cents . For on a comparison of the 3 per cents , at present with the 3 per cents , of last year ; and of the 5 per cents , at present with the 5 per cents , of last year , the Committee would be surprised to observe , how little disadvantageous the bargain in the 5 per cents , had been as compared with that in the three ; the 5 per cents having been much more stationary and not proprotionably depressed . When last year 8,500,000l . only was funded in the 5 per cents , instead of 12,000,000l , as in the recent instance , the expence created was 6l . 4s . 7¼d . per cent . In the recent instance the expence created was 6l . 5s . o¾d . per cent . making a difference of only 5½d . per cent . between the two charges . The difference in the 3 per cents , in the two years was much greater . Last year the expence was 5l . 13s . 3d . per cent . this year the expence was 6l . 4s . 1¼d . 216 Last year the interest was 4l . 4s . 2d . per cent . ; this year it was 4l . 14s . 11d . making a difference of above 10s . per cent . This was to him a satisfactory reflection , as he had so pertinaciously persisted in procuring the whole of the 12,000,000l . to be funded in the 5 per cents . Having thus stated that the whole of the charges created by both loans , wag 1,215,819l . he should next submit to the Committee the mode by which he proposed to meet these charges . Before he did this , he must add , that it was his intention to recommend a repeal of the duty on Hats , which , ever since he came into office , had continued to decrease in amount . When this tax was first levied it produced 60 or 70,000l . He did not suppose that fewer hats were worn than formerly ; but the fact was that the produce of the duty last year was only 29,332lt It had been gradually diminishing . In 1809 it was 38,000l . ; in 1809 , 33,000l . ; in 1810,31,000l . : and in 1811 , as he had already stated , only 29,332l . This was a rapidly decreasing ratio . He was aware therefore , that in giving up the duty he did not give up much , for it was gradually wearing itself out . It was the cause of great vexation and trouble to the persons carrying on the trade of hat dealers , and particularly to those who dealt on fair terms , over whom the dealer who was disposed to second the fraudulent wishes of his customers , by omitting the stamp , had a very unmerited advantage . The Committee was aware that a similar duty on gloves had formerly been abandoned . Before he came to the resolution of proposing the repeal of the duty on hats , he had seriously considered whether it might not be collected in some other manner ; but after a good deal of deliberation he was persuaded that no mode could be adopted which would not be so inconvenient to the trade and to the public , as to render it highly unadvisable . He
