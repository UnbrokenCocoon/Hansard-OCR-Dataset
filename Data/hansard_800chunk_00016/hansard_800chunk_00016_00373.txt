the present question , because they would be premature , all those learned disquisitions of which they had heard so much , respecting the Veto proposed to be given to the crown in the appointment of their Bishops , or the Domestic Arrangement , which had been suggested in its stead . He would not turn aside , to compare the Resolutions of the Catholic Prelates in 1799 , ( framed as an answer to a direct proposal from a friendly government , and in the expressed confidence of approval by the sovereign pontiff , ) with the Resolutions and Address of the same persons in September 1808 and February 1810 , when the violence of the common enemy had deprived them of every means of communication with the spiritual head of their church—whose sanction they had declared at all times to be an indispensible requisite to any arrangement on their part , and when they could have had no possible inducement to suggest facilities to a decidedly hostile administration . He did not feel it to be any part of his present duty to examine , for the purpose of endeavouring to reconcile them , those , misapprehensions , which had unhappily prevailed between their avowed agent , of whom he could never speak but with much respect , and some of their most conspicuous parliamentary friends . Those differences of opinion , however greatly to be lamented , had not deprived the Catholic cause of any one of its former supporters , in either House of Parliament ; and , whatever their ultimate amount and value should be found to be , they could not , on any just principle of reasoning , be erected into an insurmountable obstacle , in limine , to any consideration of the Petitioners ' case . Many and weighty objects would , of course , press themselves upon their lordships ' attention , when they should have once engaged in the good work of national conciliation to which they were then invited . Whenever that moment , so devoutly to be wished for , should arrive , the advocates for Catholic privilege , the enemies of the still existing system of proscription , would be prepared to enter into all the necessary details—they would be prepared to shew , that they sought ; nothing for the petitioners which was not consistent with the perfect security of the Protestant state . That the tests , by which the petitioners were already bound , afford assu- 647 rances the most complete for the protection of all our establishments , civil and Veligious . That with respect to those alleged dangers which had been so much relied upon , from the possibility of foreign appointments to the prelacy of the Catholic church , they entertained the best founded confidence in the declared and cordial disposition of that community , lay , as well as ecclesiastical , effectually to remove ail just grounds of apprehension : If , indeed their own experience of the past should not be considered as in itself sufficient security for the continuance of the same course of chaste and uninfluenced selection for the time to come . On behalf of the Petitioners , he only-claimed the justice of being permitted to prove the merits of their case : The opportunity of rebutting those false and cruel Aspersions , by which their holy religion , and they , as the professors of it , had been unceasingly assailed ; the opportunity of challenging their calumniators to come forth and shew in what manner they had tinned against their common country , by what transgressions of theirs they had de-served that condition of restraint and de-gradation , under which they still continued to suffer consistently with the unity of the Catholic church , under one and the same spiritual head , its great land-mark and distinguishing characteristic , and which they could never cease to uphold until they should have renounced the religion of their forefathers : there was no sacrifice which they were not prepared to make , to conciliate the esteem and the affections of their Protestant fellow subjects .
