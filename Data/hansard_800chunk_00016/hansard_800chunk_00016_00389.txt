the best of those who hear me , have also subscribed to tenets of such a description ; and not only so , but have anxiously endeavoured to impress these tenets upon the minds of their nearest and dearest relatives , as the best guides of life and the surest consolation in the hour of death ; if I say , I should he called upon to make declarations of this kind as the only way of proving my attachment to the established Church , and to its ministers , I very frankly own that I disclaim so exclusive , so uncharitable an attachment ; I never professed it , I do not feel it , nor , to speak plainly , do I greatly envy those who do . I beg your lordships pardon for having talked so much of myself , and for having presumed to lay before you the leading articles of a creed , which I am now much too old to change , nor in truth , if I were given to change , do I know where to go for a better—for one , I mean , better cal- 671 culated to promote individual happiness , and at the same time , that public union of heart and hand , if not of opinion , Which is so loudly called for , and at the present very serious crisis , so much wanted : that real affectionate union , I mean , which is the `` very bond of peace , of perfectness , '' and an unassailable bulwark of security , prosperity , and permanency to , I verily believe , the purest ecclesiastical establishment , and the best form of civil government , in the universe . said , he did not rise for the purpose of answering the speech of the right reverend Prelate , but to state the ground upon which he should resist the motion for going into the Committee .

It might as well be urged , that the advocates for the wildest notions of Parliamentary Reform , universal representation for instance , should ultimately prevail provided the occasional failure of their efforts to carry it in parliament should not be followed by the disturbance of the public tranquillity . His lordship then proceeded to draw the attention of the House to the doctrines and principles which had recently been promulgated upon the subject of religious liberty , and Catholic rights , which he described as of an alarming and dangerous tendency . Without entering further into that subject his lordship said he would observe , that if the rights asserted , existed now , they must always have existed , and every man who had forfeited his property on account of his religious tenets , had in that case been unjustly dispossessed ; that even the right of the House of Brunswick to the throne would be shaken to its foundation by such a doctrine , for that right rested upon a principle in contradiction to this assumed religious right , and was incompatible with it.—Lord Buckinghamshire could not , with the right reverend prelate , look at the conduct of foreign governments as affording 672 an example for this Country to follow .
