passage in question . It referred merely to a recommendation of the Committee of that society in the East , that the Scriptures should be read in public to the people in their native language . The Hindoo and Mahometan Scriptures were read publicly already , and the reading of the Christian Scriptures in the same manner , would give no offence whatever . But even this could not be attempted without the sanction of the government ; and the regulations of the government on this subject , if at all erring , fired rather on the side of extreme prudence and caution . He trusted he need make no apology for the Committee in this country ' . There was no intention to enforce this measure by any authority of government , or any compulsory means whatever . It was only proposed to leave the matter to make its own way . said he was satisfied with the explanation , and would not press his motion . called the attention of the House to the case of a soldier who had been lately condemned to be flogged in the Isle of Wight , for being absent at night . It appeared from this , that the discretionary power given in the mutiny act , was not likely to be attended with much effect in prevent- 760 ing the infliction of that disgraceful punishment . Rather than submit to it , the man actually cut his throat ; but it was sewed up , and it was said that the man only deserved additional punishment for the attempt . He belonged to the royals , and his name was John Evans .

It had been an object for many years in the Irish parliament to acquire such a control . The Bill which established it was termed the Responsibility Bill , a name implying that so long as the management of the finances was in the hands of the lord lieutenant , there was no adequate responsibility.â€”Now , this proceeding of making the lord lieutenant 's secretary Chancellor of the Exchequer , looked very like a recurrence to the old system ; and as if it was intended to put aside the board of treasury . If this was the case , it would be as well to say so , and then the public might be saved the expence of paying salaries to a number of useless lords of the treasury . As the chief secretary for Ireland was in that capacity subordinate to the lord lieutenant , and would be in the capacity of Chancellor of the Exchequer , subordinate to the right hon . gent . opposite , ( Mr. Perceval ) from his being first lord of the Irish treasury ; the question to which he more immediately required an answer was this ; whether the communications that would hereafter be made to the several boards of Commissioners in Ireland employed in the collection of the Revenue , would be made in the name of the lord lieutenant , or in the name of the treasury , and with the concurrence of the right hon . gent ? The answer to this question would decide whether or not the finances of Ireland were to 761 be under the constitutional and proper control of aboard of treasury . If it should turn
