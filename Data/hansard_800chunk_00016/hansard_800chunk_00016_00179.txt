explained that the proposed regulation first took in the surplus of the Civil List , and the deficiency only was to be supplied from the consolidated fund . objected to any augmentation 334 whatever to the Lord Lieutenant . He was already relieved from great part of the expence attending his state and dignity , by the removal of the Houses of Parliament . said , that without an increase above the present allowance , the expence must prove ruinous to any private fortune whatever . after observing that the information before the Committee on this subject only extended to the comparative increase of business in the Court of Chancery between the periods of ten years up to 1755 , and ten years from 1800 , moved for an account of the business before that court from 1755 to 1800 , and the number of Decrees from 1755 to 1810. had no objection to the motion , but could not consent to delay , till the information was produced , the measure in contemplation for the more speedy hearing of Appeals in that House , which he thought it was of great importance should be passed before the session closed , in order that they might begin in the next session on the new arrangement.—The motion was agreed to . The order of the day was read for taking into consideration the Report of the Committee relative to the slate of the Appeals in the House of Lords . The Report was read by the clerk at the table as follows : — '' Resolved , That it is the opinion of this Committee , that it is indispensably necessary , and that it so appears to be from the great number of Appeals and Writs of Error now depending in the House , amounting together to 338 , of which 296 are Appeals , and 42 Writs of Error , that a greater proportion of the time of the House of Lords should be employed in hearing Appeals , than has been hitherto allotted to this part of the business of the House ; and that it will be expedient , therefore , that the House should determine to sit for this purpose at least three days in every week during the session , meeting at ten o'clock at latest on each day till the present arrear of causes shall have been considerably reduced , and subsequently two days in the week at least , meeting at the same hour .
