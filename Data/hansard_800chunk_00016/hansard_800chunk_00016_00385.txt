few months before his death , that he had no plan , and that he could conceive no plan whatever , by which a sufficient security could be provided for the established church , in the event of the Catholic claims being granted . The constitution was essentially Protestant ; it could not bear a Catholic sovereign , and how much less a Catholic minister ? He would not say that 665 the obnoxious doctrines were now held by the Catholics ; but that they were once the tenets of the Catholic church , was proved by the evidence of all history . Let them give up the doctrine that no one could be saved out of the pale of their own church , and then , perhaps , they might have a chance of success ; but till they did this , they could not safely be trusted with political power . bore testimony to the merits of the noble lord who spoke last , but he thought it but just to say , that that noble lord had misunderstood what had been said by the noble earl to whom he alluded . ( Dr. Henry Bathurst ) , rose and said ; My Lords , if the noble and learned lord who spoke last had been content to state his own opinion , without asserting that the Catholic Petition was brought forward merely as a party question , and consequently , that those who support it , are actuated solely by party motives ; I should very gladly have remained silent : Because , the expediency , the policy , the justice , —I had almost said the necessity—of conciliating the minds of the Catholics of Ireland ; of gratifying their reasonable expectations ; of acceding to their just demands , upon prudent and equitable conditions for the security of the Civil and Ecclesiastical Establishment , have been already repeatedly discussed in this House , and have also been , as it appears to me , unanswerably proved , by noble lords , far better qualified than I am to do justice to so important a subject : —and especially by he noble earl who opened this debate , in so copions , 30 clear , and so conclusive a manner , that it would be presumption in me to attempt to add any thing to what he has advanced .

I should be sorry , my lords , to have it thought that I am hardy enough to make an assertion like this , in such an assembly , without having , what appears to me , at least , sufficient authority for so doing . I could wish that those who entertain a contrary opinion , would turn their eyes towards the continent of
