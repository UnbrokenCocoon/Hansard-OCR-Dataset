opinions had been much misunderstood , and it would have been necessary for him in some stage or other of the business , to attempt to set the matter right , had not his noble friend called on him at this time to do so by his reference . The whole proceeding was indeed so anomalous , that it was no wonder that misconceptions and misunderstandings should take place , and therefore this mutual leave became the 868 more necessary—'Damus petimusque vicissim . ' It was proper to consider the nature of the proceedings ; and here he would say , that when the noble earl had stated that he had advocated the cause of the abolishment of the Slave Trade , of the Catholics , and of the Protestant Dissenters , on the ground of justice , he could not but believe the noble earl . He had heard the powers of reasoning which he had displayed in that House ; and he thought , he was sure they could only be the result of sincerity and conviction . But how did it happen , that the noble lords opposite who heard his reasonings on those questions , which they were unable to answer , used uniformly to say , that these reasonings were no doubt very ingenious , but were entirely speculative ; and now , when the noble earl had introduced a Bill , which by his own confession was only the forerunner of a series of Bills which would go to operate a great change in the laws of this country , those noble lords whose maxim constantly was 'principles obsta , ' who had uniformly professed their determination to oppose every thing like innovation , and who would listen to nothing but what they called practical arguments , how did it happen , he repeated , that they had now no apprehension of this speculation , but thought proper to adopt it ; that they now thought proper to court one of the most dangerous innovations ? The noble lords had , it was true , had the nursing of this Bill ; and by the introduction of clauses in the Committee , they had produced a very great alteration on it . At first there was no principle in the preamble of the Bill , because the Bill bad no preamble ; but now since the clauses which had been moved in the Committee , the only words of the original Bill which had been retained were , `` Be it enacted by the Kings 's most excellent Majesty , by and with the advice and cousent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present parliament assembled , and by the authority of the same , that from and after the passing of this act , no person shall receive . `` —This was the whole of the original Bill which they had adopted ; and all the rest was to be considered in the light of an excrescence , as a superstructure on the original . He contended , that this would go to effect a material alteration in the law ; because it was contrary to what had been laid down a few days ago by the judges of the land . And here he could not help alluding to what had fallen from a 869 noble and learned lord ( Redesdale ) on a former evening , who , though he did not now hold , had formerly held , a judicial situation in the country , as to the propriety of making a declaratory law on this subject . He had frequently been told , that a systematic attempt had been made to bring the justice of the country into contempt—nay , he had frequently heard this asserted within these walls ; but if any lords should come forward and say , that this ought to be a declaratory law , for this reason , that the judges had unanimously-said that it was not the law , what was this but giving a slap in the face to the whole of the judges ? What could be
