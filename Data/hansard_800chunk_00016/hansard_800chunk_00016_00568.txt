of circulation is at an end . I admit the principle contended for by the learned member , that such a premium has a tendency to preserve guineas in circulation , and to counteract the profit which leads to their being melted and exported ; but , for the reasons already stated , it never can be recognised as a just measure to regulate the rate or value , at which another currency shall be received in liquidation of a debt . As a new regulation in this country , I am not aware of any benefit which could result from it , possessing , as we do , a currency adequate to all our internal wants , and , in my judgment , neither depreciated , nor liable to depreciation , so long as its issue is regulated upon those principles which have hitherto governed the conduct of the bank of England . In Ireland I can conceive such a practice may have had salutary effects . It has tended to preserve , to a considerable degree , a metallic currency in circulation , in a country whose national bank did not possess the same proportionable capital as the Bank of England ; and in which private capital does not yet much abound for the establishment of private banks . It was , under such circumstances , advantageous , that the transition to a circulation , in which Bank-notes were to preponderate , should be gradual ; that the efforts of credit to supply the demand for currency should be made with circumspection , both on the side of the issuers and receivers of notes ; and above all , it required time to reconcile and to accustom a population , habituated exclusively to coin , to the use of notes , to judge of their reality , of their preservation , and of the steps they were to take when the notes were worn out to have them renewed . 966 That transition has been silently , taking place , and I am induced to believe , is so far matured , that no shock to credit or industry need now be apprehended in Ireland , from any regulations which parliament in its wisdom may deem necessary to adopt for the administration of justice between man and man . The House will , I am sure , excuse my having detained them so long on the question as applied to Ireland . The exclusion of that country from the provisions of the act appeared to me to require to be examined ; and I was the more desirous of offering some general remarks on the peculiar state of the currency in that part of the United kingdom , from the misconception which has prevailed with respect to it , more especially observable in the Report of the Committee in 1804 on the exchange between Great Britain and Ireland . With respect to the extent of the Bank issues , and particularly whether some limit to their amount ought not to make a part of the present bill , as a security against depreciation arising from excessive issues , I certainly am one of those who admit that mischief might arise from a disposition in the Bank improvidently to extend their circulation of notes ; at the same time , I must say , that the facility of committing such an abuse , as well as the temptation to do so , so far as the motive of personal interest can be supposed to influence the conduct of the bank directors , has been most unreasonably exaggerated in argument . I am also ready to admit , that , in proportion as the system founded on the bank restriction act is protracted in point of time , and fortified by provisions , such as the present bill contains , it becomes more strongly , not only the right , but the duty of parliament , to impose such restraints upon the Bank as may appear calculated to protect the community at large against any improper employment of the discretion , which is now exercised by the bank .
