of which can not be mistaken , and it has my approbation as such . I trust it may be unnecessary to go further ; but if it should , parliament , I hope , will not hesitate in performing the duty , which may in that case be cast upon it . With respect to the other provisions of the Bill , namely , those which render it a misdemeanor to receive more for a guinea , or less for a Bank-note , than their standard and accustomed value , I consider them as of very subordinate importance to the clause we have been hitherto considering . So far as the clause prohibiting Bank-notes from being received at less than the sum for which they were issued , may render it illegal to claim , or accept them in discharge of a debt to a greater amount , that is , at a value inferior to their nominal value , it meets precisely the case to be provided for , and it puts the creditor in the situation I wish to see him placed in , that is , that he shall be obliged to accept the notes of the Bank of England at par , or not at all , whilst the Bank restriction act lasts . The other prohibition against purchasing the coin of the realm at more than its legal value , is of less consequence , but may be of some use , as tending to discourage a traffic in guineas , a practice novel at least in this part of the empire , not requisite if creditors are protected from the species of demand , against which I have 960 been contending , and which is principally carried on by persons , who make a trade of melting , and exporting our standard coin , a practice which law can not prevent , but which it may be expedient , as far as possible , by penalty , to check and counteract . The object of the Bill is not by law to attempt to give to a guinea , or a Bank note , a compulsory value ; no law could have this effect ; and it would be unjust , if it were possible that it should . In all prospective bargains , where the parties know what is to be the medium of payment , whether guineas or Bank-notes , no law can , or ought to restrain them from framing the price of the commodity sold , with reference to their opinion of the real value of the currency to be received , whether it be a value depending upon credit , or the intrinsic value of the medium itself . The intention is to deprive creditors , during the interval of cash payments being suspended at the Bank , of the power legally to compel debtors to pay them Banknotes , at less than they are actually worth IF the process of the law , which was framed to compel payments in standard coin , when coin could be procured , is now to be used , as an instrument to impose arbitrary conditions of payment , when coin can not be procured , Bank notes may become depreciated in public estimation . If they pass , as in justice they ought to do , in the eye of the law , at par between man and man , they are not likely to stand depreciated in the daily transactions of life . Every man in the community ought to have a common interest in upholding their credit , which will not be the case , if creditors are allowed to dictate the rate at which they alone will consent to receive them . With these views , I am disposed to support these clauses , as regulations salutary in themselves , in aid of the main object , which , I must again repeat , is , that the paper of the Bank of England shall not be exacted , under colour of law , as a depreciated medium in payment of debts ; being myself convinced ,
