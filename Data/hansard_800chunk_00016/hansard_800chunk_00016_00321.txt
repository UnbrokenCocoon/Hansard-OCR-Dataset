have originated in mistake , as the plans and estimates had been ultimately produced , and as the objection was made at so late a period , perhaps the House would not think that sufficient to prevent the third reading . But the great point for the consideration of the House was , whether they would agree to the passing of a Bill , granting leave to open 15 new lines of road , without the parties interested being apprised of their intended course . For this the Standing Order of 1807 expressly provided , as it directed that the parties concerned should be informed , by a map , of the direction of any intended road . If the Bill were agreed to , it would give to the parties , for 21 years ; a right of infringing on the estates of many persons in Perthshire , without affording them the necessary information . observed , that the powers of alteration were similar to those contained in every Turnpike Bill , and extended only 300 yards from the level road . The turn-pike road act , at present existing in Perth- 563 shire , would expire on the last day of this session ; and if the present measure were not agreed to , much inconvenience would be the result . said , that perhaps the inroad of 300 yards made on a gentleman 's estate , might include that very part of it which he prized most . The old act could not be renewed for a year , which would enable the parties to bring forward a proper Bill . thought the most advisable way would be to adjourn the debate till Thursday next . In the interim , the objectionable parts of the Bill could be expunged , and those which were not opposed , might be suffered to remain . After a few words from Mr. Huskission , Mr. Abercromby , and sir John Anstruther , the debate was adjourned , on the suggestion of the Speaker , until to-morrow , to give the parties time to confer together . said , he understood the right honourable the Master of the Rolls had , during his absence from the House , on Saturday , contradicted a report which he had noticed in his speech on the preceding evening . Perhaps he ought to apologise for having brought forward the question , which was agitated on that evening , during the absence of his honour ; but , as he was present in the early part of the afternoon , and as it was generally understood that the question would come on , he trusted he would be absolved from any blame in that respect . He was not aware of the extent of the contradiction ; if it went to deny the existence of any difference of opinion in her Majesty 's council , he should be extremely glad to hear it , as it was of very great importance to the public . He would not trouble the House with any further observations on this subject , but would beg leave to present a Petition from the inhabitants of the county of Kent , on the question of Parliamentary Reform . ( A laugh . ) expressed some surprise at the two very dissimilar subjects , which the horn gent . had in tome degree blended together . With respect to the observation he had made , as to the contradiction given by his learned friend , he could , from his recollection of the circumstance , say , that that contradiction was as full and complete as it possibly could beâ€”not only with respect to a division of voices , on a particular fact , that 564 of his Majesty 's resumption of the royal functions , but in relation to any division on any subject whatever . Points undoubtedly might have been discussed , but no dissention had prevailed . said , he was pleased to hear that there was no foundation for the report which had reached him , under such circumstances as induced him to give it a degree
