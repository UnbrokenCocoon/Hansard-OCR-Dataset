correcting the misconception , when a term fell from the noble and learned lord which he thought necessarily closed his mouth . He had certainly alluded to the judicial capacity of the noble and learned lord , but not for the purpose of charging him with a corrupt administration of it , but merely to designate him when that noble and learned lord was in Ireland . He had materially differed from that noble and learned lord , in many of his political principles , but he never questioned the purity of his administration of justice . He expressed himself satisfied with what had just fallen from the noble and learned lord , and returned his acknowledgments to their lord-ships for the patient attention with which they had honoured him . The House then divided , presented a Petition from James Oliver , esq . late a colonel in the service of the East India Company , under the presidency of Fort St. George , setting forth : `` That the petitioner entered into the service of the East India Company in the year 1769 , and continued in the Madras army until the year 1800 , at which last-mentioned date he gradually obtained the rank of colonel ; that , during the long period of his service , an interval of thirty-six years , he had been in constant employment , and had been engaged in fourteen general actions , thirty cannonades , and was at the reduction of twenty-six forts , many of which were taken by assault ; and that he was appointed to and employed from January 1802 to July 1803 in the civil and military government of the Molucca Islands in the eastern seas , captured from the Dutch ; and in the year 1805 , he returned to England for the benefit of his health ; and that complaints against him were put forth , in a letter from the court of directors to the Madras government , bearing date the 15th of February 1804 , charging principally , that , while in the civil government and military command of the Moluccas , the petitioner had been concerned in the purchase of a certain quantity of spices with an European inhabitant of the island ; next , that he had an interest in a cargo of European goods sent there for sale , which had given rise to an alledged arbitrary act , on his part , preventive of the fair sale of other European articles composing the investment of the officers belonging to two of the Company 's ships , and consequently prejudicial to those officers ; and , lastly , that he had prematurely delivered up to the Dutch the islands entrusted to his government ; and that a Committee being appointed for the purpose of investigating these matters , the said Committee assembled on the 4th day of August 1804 , and proceeded to examine witnesses in support of the matters submitted to them , and continued their sittings for the space of a month and upwards , when at this latter period , and under circumstances to which considerable suspicion attaches , and notwithstanding the instruction under 695 which they were bound to act , that the I accused should be acquainted , in limine , with the nature and full extent of the exceptions taken at his conduct in the premises , the government of Fort St. George sent fresh articles of accusation against the petitioner , and required the Committee to proceed thereon ; and that the new criminatory matters depended solely on the assertion of an individual of the name of William Betty , and were submitted in the form of a letter forwarded to the government of Fort St. George after the writer of the said letter had been dismissed from the Company 's service by the sentence of a court martial , and after he had already embarked and was on his passage ; and that the Committee was detained for several weeks until the 18th day of February 1805 , when the petitioner was allowed to urge certain matters in his own behalf ;
