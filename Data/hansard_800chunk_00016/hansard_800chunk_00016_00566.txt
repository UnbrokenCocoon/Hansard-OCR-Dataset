In those counties , no other medium than coin has ever been taken for rent . Guineas have been uniformly the medium of payment between landlord and tenant , both before and since the Bank Restriction Act ; and guineas have , at all times , borne a premium in the North of Ireland . The only new feature in the Irish case is the increased amount of the premium requisite to procure guineas . In November last , when I left Ireland , it did not exceed from 2 to 3 per cent . It has since risen as high as 15 per cent. , but has latterly fallen considerably ; whereas , in Great Britain , the uniform practice has been , to pay rents not in coin , but in Bank paper ; and no instance has occurred , till the present , of its being refused to be accepted at par . The Irish landlords appear then to have a much stronger claim in equity , to adhere to a practice long established between them and their tenantry , and which has been therefore no surprise upon the Litter , than my lord King has to introduce at this moment , a novel mode of payment under a dormant stipulation in a lease ; and it is not a little remarkable , that the same set of circumstances which have determined lord King to adopt , for the first time , the Irish practice , should have induced the landlords in Ireland , if not to abandon , at least materially to relax theirs ; for they not only have very generally , far the accommodation of their tenantry , consented to accept their rents in Bank-notes ; but they have accepted them on terms much more favourable to their tenantry , than a rate calculated on the premium of the day for guineas . A premium , it is true , has generally been required , seldom however higher than from 2Â½ to 5 per cent . ; but nothing approaching to 963 the scale of lord King 's demand has been adopted as a general practice in any part of Ireland . Whilst I contend that the practice at this moment in the north of Ireland , between landlord and tenant , is one of much greater indulgence to the tenantry , than the rule lord King is inclined to lay down ; and whilst I consider that the state of things in that portion of the United Kingdom , growing out of a long established usage , which has of late been accommodating itself to the convenience of the parties , rather than taking any novel shape of disadvantage to the tenants , do not constitute a case of such pressing inconvenience , as should induce parliament in the absence of the Irish members , to enter upon the consideration of a question of so local a nature ; I am at the same time free to confess , that , if the practice in the north of Ireland should not take some more settled shape , before the next session of parliament ; and if the difficulty of procuring coin should continue to be as great as it has latterly been , it may become necessary to apply a legislative corrective to the evil ; for an evil it must be admitted to be of the greatest magnitude , that between the landlords and tenantry of a country , no fixed rate of payment should prevail ; but that it should be at the discretion of each particular landlord to decide , whether his tenant is to pay him , as an inducement to accept bank-notes , the full premium at which guineas are bought and sold , which has been as high as 15 per cent . and may be still higher ; or whether he is to pay at an inferior rate , and what ; for however cash payments , in those particular counties , may rest upon ancient and uninterrupted usage , yet it must be admitted , that it has become a very new question in practice
