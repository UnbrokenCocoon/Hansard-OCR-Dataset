is not therefore under any doubt of what the right , as well as the duty of the House is , nor yet of the principle , that a due caution on the part of the bank is necessary to be observed , with respect to the amount of their notes in circulation , that induces me , more than to doubt the expediency of such a regulation . I am conscious much depends on a sound exercise of that discretion , but I know of no better security for its due exercise , than that it should 967 remain under the superintending eye of parliament , in the hands which have hitherto administered it , with so much fidelity and advantage to the public . I see great objection in principle to any absolutely fixed limit . To name as the extreme amount a larger sum than that now in circulation , might seem to countenance an issue to that precise extent . To confine them within their present amount , incurs the risk , that , if the demand for circulating medium should increase with the growing prosperity of the country , the supply will be thrown into other and less safe channels ; and if there is no precise limit which parliament can fix and adhere to , and that there can be none is obvious from the very nature of a circulating : medium , which ought to fluctuate in amount with the extent of transactions to which it is applied , of all courses let us not expose ourselves to be called on to sit in judgment , from time to time , upon the quantum of issue required , which must be the case if this limitation is to be relaxed , from time to time , upon a case to be made out before parliament , by the bank , of its necessity . It is not surprising that a considerable degree of jealousy should prevail with respect to the exercise of such a power in any hands ; I am inclined to believe , that much of the feeling excited on what is called the bullion question , has originated in a disinclination , not the most enlightened , which mankind have in general to observe a corporate body , such as the bank of England , amassing unusual gains , even though growing out of an exercise of their credit , which contributes to the accommodation of every individual in the community . But what I can least understand , is , that any man should condescend so far in controversy , as to attempt to draw a parallel between the assignats of France , and the notes of the Bank of England : between a paper issued by a bankrupt government , upon no other alleged security at the time than the national domains of France , which standing on a revolutionary title , Sold almost for nothing ; between a paper forcibly issued to pay debts , and to carry on the current services of a stale , and one issued by a private corporation with a view to their own immediate profit , and on what they deem solid and indisputable security ; between a paper forced upon its subjects by a government which has no other means of payment ; and a paper never issued , except at the instance of per- 968 sons , ready to deposit value , and consenting to pay 5 per cent . for the temporary use of it . To infer that a paper circulation , founded on such principles , must follow the course of French assignats , and the other forced currencies we have witnessed in modern times , does appear to roe such a substitution of clamour and assertion in the place of sober sense , as hardly to deserve notice . At the same time I can not wonder , that men of reflecting minds should hesitate , upon the practicability of a currency resting for any length of time with undiminished credit , upon any other than a metallic basis , which shall afford to every
