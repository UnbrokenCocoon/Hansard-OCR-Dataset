House any noble lords whose rare good for-tune it had been , in administering the 651 Irish government , to have wanted the firmness of political constancy in what they have refused to the Catholics , and in what they have conceded to them , the dignity and the grace of voluntary conciliation—if there should happen to be found amongst them any noble lords who had ever descended from the high stations in which they may have been placed , to volunteer an unfounded testimony against the Catholic inhabitants of that country , to every individual of which , from former official habits and situation , such noble lords were called upon in an especial manner to render impartial justice , and to afford equal protection.—If , he said , there were any noble lords to be found in that House , such as he had described , he would only wish to recall to their recollection that decent forbearance and respect for the religious opinions of others , which distinguished their proceedings on the late occasion , as the rule by which to regulate their present conduct , in considering the alledged grievances of that great community of dissenters from the State Religion , whose Petitions were then upon their lordship 's table . Having alluded already to that memorable treaty concluded at Limerick with the Irish army in October 1691 , and ratified under the great seal in April 1692 , which gave to the British sovereign peace , and a second kingdom , and to the other contracting party the fruitful source of bitter disappointment and unheeded complaint for violated faith , he presented himself before their lordships , armed with this important instrument , to claim for the Petitioners at their hands , a just though tardy reparation . In proceeding to prove their case , he should then call the attention of that House to another document , not of equal antiquity , nor sanctioned by the same official symbol of authority , but , if the most explicit declarations of the ministers in both countries , during the progress of the important discussions on the measure of Legislative Union , were to avail aught , as proofs of their own views , respecting the nature , of those public objects , to which the accomplishment of that measure was expected to lead , was not the Irish Catholic taught to look forward , with the greatest confidence , to a prompt and just consideration of his own question , as the certain and immediate consequence of an United parliament ? And , when he had been thus prevailed upon , from such prospects as 652 these , to become a party to the surrender of his own legislature , which confessedly could never have been accomplished without his aid , is it not too late to tell him , that with that legislature were extinguished all those flattering prospects , and that he had closed the door against himself for ever ? Sanctioned thus , as much by the acknowledged and avowed spirit of one important treaty , as by the express letter of another , he had still to produce to their lordships on the part of the petitioners , further titles—on each of which , taken by itself , he could almost venture to rest their cause . First , the solemn disclaimer by the six Catholic Universities , in 1789 , of all those unchristian and abominable doctrines , the existence of which , as principles of his religion , could alone justify the exclusion of the Catholic from any one civil or political privilege . Secondly , the formal protest , by command of the sovereign Pontiff himself , in 1791 , against those imputed doctrines , when , at the suggestion of the British government , the exceptionable words were omitted in the consecration oath of the Irish Catholic . Bishops . Thirdly , the testimony borne by our own Statute-book , in the preamble of the Act of 1778 , to the character and conduct of his Catholic countrymen . Fourthly , the oaths of allegiance to the
