country ; and that , if the desirable objects above suggested can not at present be attained , without sacrificing any of the interests , or compromising the honour and dignity of the country , the petitioners rely with the fullest confidence on the House adopting some such speedy mode as would operate in amelioration of the present distresses of the petitioners . '' then presented the Petition from several weavers and spinners of cotton handicrafts artists and labourers , resident in the town of Bolton , in the county of Lancaster , or its vicinity , setting forth , `` That the major part of the petitioners are engaged in or dependent on the cotton manufacture , and that such manufacture hath of late years been subject to great fluctuations , whereby the petitioners have been reduced to frequent necessity , and oft deprived of the necessaries of life ; and that at all times the petitioners have borne those sufferings with becoming fortitude , but their present burthen impels them , at this very awful juncture , to lay their distress before the House , in the hope that some means will be devised to afford them relief : and that not more than two-thirds of the looms of the petitioners are employed , and a proportionate number of other industrious artists and handicrafts are also destitute of work : and that those of the petitioners who yet have employ are so much reduced in the price of their labour , that , on a fair average , they can not earn more than 5s . per week , and that , from these causes the petitioners are absolutely involved in the deepest distress , not being able to procure a sufficiency of even the coarsest food for themselves and 343 families , nor to pay rent for their habitations ; their trivial effects and implements of industry are either already or must speedily be sold at one fourth of their cost to satisfy their landlords , and the petitioners are thereby deprived of even a chance in better times ; and that the severe privations endured by the industrious poor have introduced a most malignant lever , and want and penury have long since filled the workhouses , but the applicants for relief are too numerous to be supplied with even a scanty allowance ; several subscriptions have been made by the friends of humanity , yet these are very inadequate , nor can effectual relief be given , as the distressed objects daily increase , unless the wisdom of the House devise some method to remove or alleviate the general calamity , which now threatens one common ruin to the greater part of the inhabitants of that once happy county ; and praying the House to take into its most serious consideration the very alarming state of the cotton manufacture , which , until lately , afforded employ in the various branches connected therewith to not less than five hundred thousand persons , and that they will enact such salutary laws as will give employ and suitable wages to the industrious inhabitants of that exceedingly distressed part of the empire . '' said , before he moved that the Address of that House to the Prince Regent , on the subject of Mr. Palmer 's Claims , and his royal highness 's Answer thereto , be read , he begged to wave the notice relative to a legislative provision for any future illness of his Majesty , which Stood for that evening , as the discussion on the question he wag then about to introduce to the House , would probably occupy a considerable time . Even however if that were not likely to be the case , he would have felt it his duty to postpone that notice , in consequence of certain circumstances , which had come to his knowledge , and to the knowledge of the public .
