of wine consumed was 14,550 tons ; in 1780 , 15,087 tons ; in 1787 , 14,780 tons ; making the average of the three years an annual consumption of 14,800 tons . At that period the average price of port wine was 70l . 11s . 6l . per pipe . In 1807 , the quantity of wine consumed was 24,090 tons : in 1808,24,757 tons ; in 1809 , 22,331 tons ; the average of these three years being an annual consumption of 23,726 tons . At the former period the duty was 30l . perton ; at the latter 95l The average price at the former period being 70l . 11s . at the latter period 192l . 14s . per ton : so that under both the increase of duty and the increase of price the consumption had increased . He could hardly conceive it possible to adduce a more striking instance of general prosperity . The average consumption of tallow , for the three years ending in 1787 , was 210,174 cwt . The average for the three years , ending in 1809 , was 347,170 cwt . The price at the former period was 2l . 8s . 8d . per cwt . ; at the latter period , 4l . 11s . being one-third more . Nor did this increase in the consumption of tallow arise from any de crease in the consumption of oil . The average consumption of oil for the three years , ending in 1787 , was 9,730 tons : the average consumption for the three years , ending in 1809 , was 19,126 tons . The price at the former period was 19l . 18s . 9d . per ton ; at the latter period 32l . 9s . The average quantity of tobacco annually imported for the three years ending in 1787 , was 6,553,000lbs . The annual average for the three years ending in 1809 , was 12461,000lbs . The price at the former period was 8¼d . a pound ; at the latter If . 7¾d . He was aware that these details Were very tedious , but he had the consolation of knowing that they were at the same time very satisfactory , as they af- 222 forded the most convincing evidence of the gradual and great increase of the riches of the country . Tie Chancellor of the Exchequer concluded a most perspicuous statement , by apologizing to the Committee for having occupied so much of their time , and by expressing his readiness to afford any further explanation that might be desired . He then moved his first Resolution . objected to the Property Tax as unequal and unjust ; but congratulated the right hon gentleman on the terms on which he had procured the loan . objected to the tax on cotton , as only likely to produce serious injury to the country . This was not perhaps the proper stage for entering into the discussion minutely , but he could not help observing that a duty on the raw material , which would make a difference of 4d . in the pound , upon an article not worth above 12d . per pound , at present , should not be adopted with precipitation . He was sure the right hon . the Chancellor of the Exchequer would find , upon inquiry , that such a tax would have an injurious operation upon the manufactures of the country . As to the timber tax , he thought it would have a tendency to exclude the timber from the Baltic , and , perhaps , in that view was beneficial , as a means of encouraging our trade with our own colonies , and with America , but as an article of revenue he did not know that any expectations should be founded on it . said , that the tax had been already proposed , and was in an advanced stage at the present moment . He denied that there would be any apprehension from it of injury to our manufactures . We had much cotton in our own colonies ,
