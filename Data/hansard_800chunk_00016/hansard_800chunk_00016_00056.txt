it would be attended . He would touch afterwards on the solidity of this last argument . Something had , too , been acquired to the doctrine of depreciation by the admission , that , as applied to external purchases , our currency had fallen in value . Now , that these external purchases necessarily affected the price of commodities in the home market , was a point very properly noticed immediately by his hon . friend , and he should therefore not dwell upon it . A great distinction had been said to exist between the present alledged excess of paper , and the excess in Ireland , whch was followed by the open establishment of two prices . But what was the cause of this difference ? Two prices did not openly prevail in this country , from the terrors of the statute of Edward 6 , a statute not applicable to Ireland . It had been stated by the right hon . gent. , that our circulating medium amounted before the Bank restriction , to 47,000,000l . including 36,000,000l . of specie , and 11,000,000l . of Bank Paper ; and that , at present , we had in circulation , but 3,000,000l . of specie , and 23,000,000l . of paper . He had to observe , in the first instance , that this statement entirely overlooked the issues of the country banks , on the amount of which he had some observations to make . He had moved some time ago for the production of several papers from the stamp office , which shewed that in the year 1805 the number of stamps , taken at the lowest sums to the issue of which they were legally applicable when converted into the form of country banknotes , would amount to 10,100,000l . ; in the following year to 10,000,000l . ; in 1807 to 6,000,000l . ; in 180g to 8,000,000l . and in 1809 to 15,000,000l . In the last year their amount was 9,000,000l . These stamps could only be in use , according to the law , for the period of three years . Thus the years 1805–6–7 , would prove the whole amount of country notes in circulation to be not less than 26,500,000l . and to have increased latterly to 29,400,000l . He was aware that this account might be liable to some deductions , but he believed them to be inconsiderable . The deposits of paper now kept by Bankers fell very far short of what they were when subject to be called on for payments in specie . There was probably at least 6,000,000l of 137 specie originally always in their coffers , to meet any accidental demand for it . This was so much withdrawn from the whole amount of the currency at the former period . Admitting , then , the correctness of the statement that , before the Restriction there was in the country 30,000,000l . of specie , beside 11,000,000l . of Bank paper , and 8,000,000l . of country notes , this deduction would leave the whole amount of the currency at that lime , about 43,000,000l . The present amount of Bank paper in circulation is stated to be 23,000,000l . and the specie at 3,000,000l . which he believed , however , to be less than it actually was . After making an allowance of two millions for paper cancelled or destroyed , we should have twenty-five millions remaining , which after a further allowance for the sum employed as deposits or rests by the country bankers , would constitute a sum total of 48,000,000l . and an increase of 5,000,000l . above the whole amount in circulation , antecedent to the restriction . The increase in London alone in paper applicable to the purposes of the whole-sale trade , had been calculated to be from 9 to 13,000,000l . It ought to be remembered at the same time , that this great increase was contemplated by various recent regulations ; the use of paper had been much circumscribed , and the quantity of circulation greatly economised .
