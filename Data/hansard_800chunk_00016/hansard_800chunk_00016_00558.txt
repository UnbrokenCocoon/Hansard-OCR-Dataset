, for the general interest , prohibited the Bank from fulfilling the letter of its contract , in respect to cash payments , with the holders of its notes , it should mean to compel the holders of those notes to fulfil the letter of their engagements with respect to cash payments towards their creditors ? 951 The declared ground on which the legislature passed the Restriction act was , to protect public and private credit against the calamity of the Bank being obliged to discontinue its functions ; involving as the necessary and immediate consequence of such discontinuance , the ruin of all private banks , and the extinction of the entire circulating medium of the country , so far as it rested on banking credit . Parliament was morally justified in passing that law , first from a conviction , that , whatever the evils of such a temporary interruption to the legitimate money system of the country were , they wore upon the whole less than the evils to be apprehended if things were allowed to take their course : and secondly , from there being no reason to presume , that Bank-paper , so long as its issues continued to be regulated upon the principles which had hitherto governed the conduct of the Bank of England , would , as a medium of circulation , lose any part of its value , compared with the commodities generally of the country . I do not mean to renew the argument on depreciation in detail , but I must here re-assert , as my deliberate judgment , trying the fact upon the only sound principles upon which it can be examined , that , at this day , the notes of the Bank of England are not depreciated , under any fair sense which can be affixed to that term . I admit they are not convertible as formerly at pleasure into coin , nor can they purchase , in the market , the same quantity of standard gold ; but this , as I conceive , arises solely from causes affecting the value of gold , both in its coined and uncoined state . With the exception of the precious metals . Bank-notes have the same powers of purchasing all other commodities , which they would have had at this day , if no necessity for shutting up the guineas in the Bank , or for sending gold abroad in unusual quantities , had ever occurred . Such , at least , is my belief . Such I wish to be understood by the noble lord ( Folkestone ) , is the sense , in which I deny that Bank notes are now depreciated . Upon that conviction my conduct , as a member of parliament , must be guided , and under it , I do not consider that any injustice or act of bankruptcy has been committed towards the public creditor , by affording him no other option in payment of his dividends , than Rank notes at par : and I am further prepared to contend , that any person , who in the present state 952 of things endeavours to avail himself of the letter of his contract , to force payment in cash , adopts a course of conduct altogether inconsistent with its spirit and equity , and assumes to himself not only an undue advantage over his creditor ( both being in duty bound to bear their fair share of the inconveniences arising from the contest in which we are engaged ) , but that he is taking to himself , under the colour of law , an advantage beyond what could have accrued to him , had the currency of the country remained undisturbed . That my lord King does not mean to submit to his fair share of the inconveniences of the limes is obvious , from the principle of his claim being , that his tenant should put him , at whatever expense to himself , precisely in the same situation in which he would have stood , as to the medium of payment , if no Restriction
