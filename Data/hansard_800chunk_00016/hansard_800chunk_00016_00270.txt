who was the subject of the motion , to hold that it must be acted on as if it amounted to a total and perpetual exclusion from office . If the noble lord would take an opportunity of referring back to what occurred at the time , it would be found that , whatever might be supposed as to the propriety and decency of the royal duke 's retiring for a time , the great majority of the House had no idea that this was to operate as a bar to his being ever again employed as Commander-in-Chief . It would have been most unjust in the House to have left matters in that state , thereby setting a trap for any minister or for any set of men who at any future period might advise his Majesty that it was for the interest of the country that his royal highness should be restored to the office he had formerly held , and that there was not anything appearing on the face of the Journals of the House , which could in any degree operate as a bar to such re-appointment . Every thing which was then agreed to became the subject of minute consideration ; and he ventured to affirm , that nothing 482 was then done , or even contemplated , which could have had the effect of preventing the recall of his royal highness to the situation of Commander in Chief . At least such was the impression the transaction had on his mind ; and he disclaimed the most distant idea of having given , or of being capable of giving advice to the Prince Regent , which could go to lessen the dignity of that House , or to call forth their censure upon his conduct . He contended , therefore , that it must be obvious that this nomination had been made without any previous opinion as to the impropriety of it having been declared by that House . It was for the House now to say , however , whether this was a case in which the prerogative had or had not been well exercised ? He contended that it had been wisely and properly exercised , at the time the nomination had taken place ; that the nomination was called for by the tried and eminent services of his royal highness , who had already given convincing proofs that the situation would be more fitly supplied by him than by any other person . On that persuasion , he and those who acted with him acted , and in pursuance of the conviction on their own minds , recommended his royal highness to the Prince Regent as the very fittest person to supply the vacancy which had occurred in the office of Commander in Chief of the army . On that principle he had proceeded , and he hoped for the sanction of the House to the advice he had given . did not think the right honourable gentleman who had just sat down could justify his own conduct in recommending to the Prince Regent to replace the duke of York in the situation of Commander in Chief , against the Resolutions standing on the Journals of the House , unless he was prepared to say that the duke of York was the only fit person in the country to fill the situation of Commander in Chief . When the House purposed agreeing to a Resolution , on the subject of the conduct of his royal highness , the natural consequence of which must be to cause the dismissal of his royal highness , when to prevent the adoption of such a Resolution , his royal highness himself gave in his resignation ; and when the House then came to a Resolution , declaring that his royal highness having resigned , it was no longer necessary for them to proceed in the enquiry , was not this saying that it was his resignation alone which 483 precluded the necessity of their proceeding ; and that their opinion was , that he ought not to come back into the situation , though they
