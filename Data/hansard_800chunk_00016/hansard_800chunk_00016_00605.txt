demand the taxation of such a bill as that which I have shewn , there can be no doubt , even if I could not produce the opinion of his Majesty 's Attorney-general to that effect . Yes , the opinion of sir V. Gibbs , and of the Solicitor-general , signed also Charles Robinson , William Battine , T. Jarvis , to all of whom , the memorial which I presented to the Admiralty was referred in April 1809 . `` The expences , '' say these learned gentlemen , `` in this case do not appear to have been brought to the knowledge of the court so as to have given the judge an opportunity of exercising his judgment upon them ; that would be the proper mode of redress for grievances of this description . '' 1020 Thus instructed , I addressed the judge on my return to Malta , in February last soliciting that he would be pleased to , direct my bill to be taxed , to which he returned the following answer , addressed on his Majesty 's service , `` My lord in ; reply to your letter of yesterday 's date , I , beg leave to refer you to your proctor for the information you are desirous of , it not-being the practice of the vice admiralty , court here , any more than the court of King's-bench in England , to enter into private correspondence with suitors on the subject of their suits or of any matters connected with them .
