that it is of a value which entitles it , both in equity and in justice , to be accepted at par . I shall not detain the House by combating the assertions brought forward , that the present system must lead to a maximum , and that the fact of depreciation is confirmed by the existence already of two prices , a gold and a paper price . It is enough to remark , that the measure 961 of a maximum can never be a rational relief even in the most undisguised and extravagant state of depreciation to which paper-currencies ( wholly dissimilar , be it remembered , to ours ) have ever been reduced . No human tyranny could render a law of maximum other than an expedient to starve a community , and to aggravate both public and private distress . It would be a waste of lime to contend against the applicability of such a system to a currency such as we possess , the solidity of which no man doubts , and which preserves its value , at this moment , compared with all other commodities except bullion , as steadily as it did in the year 1809 , when the present excessive price of gold took its rise ; and as to the question of two prices , if the fact of such a practice prevailing was proved , still I should deny , that this necessarily established the fact of depreciation : on the contrary , I should contend , that this must happen , whenever a difference of value takes place for any length of time between bullion and Bank paper , as the price of bullion will sooner or later , through fraudulent operations on the coin , affect , to a degree , the value of guineas ; but , as I maintain , that this disparity of value may as well arise from the value of guineas being raised , either from the cause I have now referred to , or from their scarcity , as from the value of Bank paper being depressed ; and as every test at this moment conspires to prove , that gold has greatly risen , and none , when fairly examined , except the comparison with gold itself , suggests that Bank-notes have fallen ; were even two prices as universal here , as they have been in the North of Ireland for years , I should still say , that the depreciation of Bank-notes , in the practical or ordinary sense of that expression , was by no means the necessary consequence ; and that depreciation could not be truly imputed to the paper of the Bank of England at the present moment . Having argued against the mode of payment insisted on by ray lord King , and , as I trust , established its injustice , it may be asked how it comes that a system , which is unjust in Great Britain , should be tolerated in Ireland , and why , when parliament is legislating upon this subject , Ireland should be specially excepted out of the Bill ? The question is a fair one , and I shall endeavour to assign satisfactory reasons , for not at present extending the measure to Ireland , more especially at this 962 late period of the session , and in the absence of the members from that part of the United kingdom . When it is stated , that the practice , which it is intended by this Bill to prohibit in Great Britain , has long prevailed in Ireland , it is material to distinguish between the practice of Ireland generally , and of a few of the Northern counties , perhaps not more than four or five in number . In all other parts of Ireland , the rents have been invariably paid in Bank-notes , and I have never heard an instance of any landlord refusing to receive them at par . The practice in the Northern counties , where the rents are paid in coin , is very distinguishable from lord King 's case .
