suspension of-cash payments , let the public have the assurance that they are so employed by the Bank , as to ensure their ability to resume those payments , without convulsion or distress , at the period which the legislature has fixed for the resumption of them . This , I think , is a suggestion , the adoption of which would be no less creditable to the Bank than satisfactory to the public . For this or any other measure calculated to remedy the evils acknowledged to exist , we can , after the decision to which this House has already come , rely only on the effect which may be produced by our discussions upon the advised discretion of the Bank , and upon the awakened attention of the public . But at least , if we will do no good , let us , in the name of common sense , not do any harm . If we will not set right the course of the vessel , let us at least not destroy the chart and compass by which it may steer Let us leave the evil , if it must be so 124 to the chance of a gradual and noiseless correction . But let us not resolve as law , what is an incorrect and imperfect exposition of the law . Let us not resolve as fact , what is contradictory to universal experience . Let us not expose ourselves to ridicule by resolving as the opinions of the people , opinions which the people do not , and which it is impossible they should , entertain . This is not the way to settle the public feeling , and to set the subject at rest . It is the way to ensure renewed and interminable discussions . That we may at least not incur this unnecessary mischief , by adopting the Resolutions now before us , I move . Sir , that you do now leave the chair . regretted , that he was again under the necessity of trespassing upon the time of the Committee upon this subject , but there were some points in the speech of his right hon . friend which he could not avoid noticing . His right hon . friend seemed to think that he ( the Chancellor of the Exchequer ) ought to retract the admission he had made on a former night , namely , that the diminution of the quantity of paper might diminish the balance of exchange against us , because it made against his general argument the admission which he had made , however , he was not disposed to retract , because it did not appear to him to clash in the slightest degree with the principles which he maintained . The diminution of paper in circulation would make a favourable alteration in the exchange , but then it would be necessary to discontinue the exertions we were making abroad , and to abandon our allies : but this would not be the only inconvenience which would result , because the same operation would affect our commerce , our agriculture , and all those sources of wealth by which we had been so long able to maintain this contest . It appeared to him , therefore , that the question for the Committee to decide was , whether it would be a wise policy to discontinue those exertions which we were making upon the Continent , and injure our agriculture and commerce , which we must do if we dimnished the quantity of paper in circulation for the purpose of making an alteration in the course of exchange.â€”He would not repeat all the arguments which he had before used , to shew that what gentlemen termed the depreciation of paper , did not arise from an over-issue of it , but from : other causes ; but he was convinced that 125 the more gentlemen investigated the subject , the more they would be convinced of that fact . It had been asked , whether it was prudent and safe to continue the present system , and to suffer gold to
