to depend on general practice at the bar for their support , and are therefore unable to devote little more than an hour at any one time to the investigation of accounts , however complicated , or detection of 304 frauds , however subtle , because the commissioners are paid according to the number and not according to the duration of their sittings , and are consequently not uninterested in according to every proposal of adjournment , that great source of delay and expense ; second , because the expenses of a commission , which in all cases are considerable , and in many most enormous , are uniformly charged upon the bankrupt 's fund , a fund which , from its nature , instead of being taxed in so oppressive a manner , and thereby so seriously diminished , ought to be relieved from every burthen , and rendered as productive as possible ; third , because too great difficulty attends the proof of acts of bankruptcy , even in cases of unequivocal insolvency , and in the obtaining a joint commission , whence fraudulent references are had on mortgages and other securities , and considerable impediments raised against the recovery of the bankrupt 's effects , and their collection thereby rendered most difficult and expensive ; fourth , because the property of a trader , taken under execution , is constantly sold at a most ruinous undervalue in consequence of the precipitancy of sheriffs in the sale thereof , caused by their apprehensions of some being rescued from their hands by the issuing of a commission of bankruptcy , by which sale the creditors of such trader are most grievously injured ; fifth , because punishment of death , to which nonconforming and fraudulent bankrupts are indiscriminately liable , confers impunity by preventing prosecution , and because there is no sufficient penalty against persons who shall harbour a concealed bankrupt , or shall assist in embezzling or concealing his effects , or in withdrawing them out of the realm ; sixth , because the punishment in fabricating fraudulent liens and covers on property in contemplation of bankruptcy is not sufficiently comprehensive or penal , and does not extend to agents and accessaries as well as principals ; seventh , because bankrupts have not now any fair means of support during the progress of a commission , and therefore under strong temptations to be guilty of concealment , and to commit perjury for the preservation of their existence , and because they are often deprived of their legal and merited allowance , when entitled thereto , by the uncontrouled prodigality of expence attending commissions of bankruptcy , and because commissioners have not the power of encouraging 305 good conduct in bankrupts , by ordering the expence of their certificate to be paid from their effects ; and that the petitioners , having now detailed some of the numerous imperfections in the bankrupt code , and of the evils of its practical administration , and being persuaded of the incalculable injury they have and must ever produce in a trading country , by destroying the security and confidence of commercial dealings , most earnestly entreat the House to take the same into its most serious consideration , and to enact such regulations therein as to its wisdom shall seem best calculated for the more effectual prevention of the same in future .
