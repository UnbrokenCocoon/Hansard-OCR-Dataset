and about the end of the same month , the Committee made their Report to the government of Fort St. George ; and that the petitioner not being suspended at the time of making such report , or being made acquainted with any proceedings intended to be instituted against him there-upon , although he had reason to apprehend that , from the direction of the court of directors in the event of such report being unfavourable , he should be suspended the service ; he had consequently every reason to conclude the report was not unfavourable in its general tendency ; and that a copy of the said report was respectfully , but in vain , requested by the petitioner within a reasonable time , and he being then in a state of great debility , obtained permission ( after being obliged to execute certain securities ) , to embark for England ; and that having arrived here early in September 1806 , he reported his arrival to the court of directors ; and having on the 1st of October following , received a notice that the said court was about to proceed to the consideration of his case , the petitioner , the better to enable himself to make his defence , made repeated applications for a copy of the aforesaid report , but without effect ; and , on the 27th of November following , the said court of directors made communication in form to the petitioner , that they had dismissed him their military service ; and that the determination of the court of directors has been since published to the King 's and their-own army in India , stating that the petitioner was dismissed from the service of the Company for gross 696 violation of trust reposed in him whilst commanding officer of the Molucca Islands : and that such dismissal does not appear to have originated from any breach of military duty , but for an offence alledged to have been committed by the petitioner in a civil capacity , as a ministerial officer of the Company , in which capacity the petitioner can clearly prove that he made a saving to his honouurable employers of 303,404l . sterling , in the short space of eighteen months ; and the measure was not sanctioned by the proceedings of a court martial : this power is submitted to the House as usurped by the East India Company , not only in direct opposition to the articles of war , but also to the subsequent statute , expressly reserving to the King the right of making rules for the government of the East India Company 's armies ; and that the petitioner , having been denied all access to the proceedings of the Committee of Enquiry at Madras , and to their ultimate report , and finding , from the best legal information he could obtain , that there was no process to compel the said court of directors to deliver to him the copies of the said proceedings , or the report upon which they had been founded , he addressed a memorial to the commissioners for the affairs of India , commonly denominated the Board of Controul , but was informed , through the secretary of that Board , that the commissioners had not any controul over the subject matter of his memorial ; and that the petitioner therefore humbly reasserts that the court of directors of the East India Company , of the year 1806â€“7 , have acted in contravention to the act of parliament made and provided for the better government of the Company 's army in India , by dismissing him there from without a legal trial by a competent court ; and that they have hereby assumed inordinate power , and deprived him of the honours and comforts to which he was justly entitled , from his many and great exertions ; and praying the House to take his case into consideration , and to grant such further relief in the premises as to them shall seem fit . said the court of directors had certainly a right to dismiss their
