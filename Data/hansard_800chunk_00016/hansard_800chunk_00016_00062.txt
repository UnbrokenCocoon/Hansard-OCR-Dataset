against it ? As to the authority of lord Hale , he admitted it to be great , but it was opposed by that of Blackstone , who held that the king 's prerogative did not extend to the debasement of the current coin . In what part of Hale , too , was his opinion found ? It was in a commentary on the reports of cases in Ireland , by sir John Davis . The 145 House was , therefore , called on to declare that lo be a royal prerogative , which even prerogative lawyers had considered doubtful . He was happy to see the crown lawyers in their places on this occasion . contended that all those who had read the Resolution of the hon . and learned gent . must perceive that he had himself subscribed to the opinion of lord Hale . This was the natural arid obvious meaning of his expressions . ( Hear , hear ! from Mr . Wynn . ) He would not be prevented by any vociferation , however offensive , from declaring his opinion . He extolled the value and authority of sir J. Davis 's Reports , and observed that the Resolution before the House did not imply that the prerogative was to be exercised without consent of parliament . vindicated , the right of every member to interrupt another when advancing unsupported assertion ? : , and observed that the case in Ireland , mentioned in the Reports alluded to , took place at a period when Judges travelled in Ireland in the midst of an army . said that as a former Amendment for omitting certain words in the Resolution had been rejected , he should move that there be added to it these words `` and that it is expedient to declare it . '' said , he was indebted to the right hon . mover for thus giving him an opportunity to remark , that the prerogative of altering the denomination of the coin having been limited and defined by a positive statute , he could not conceive what motive could induce any member to call upon the House to contradict by its Resolutions the written law of the land . If in conformity to such a resolution , a proclamation should appear to-morrow for altering or lowering the standard , even by a single grain , of our currency , any man acting in obedience to it would subject himself to all the penalties of the law . With this conviction , he intended , therefore , if the right hon . gent . 's Amendment should be rejected , to propose in lieu of it the following additionâ€” '' and that the weight and fineness of the gold and silver required to be contained in the coins of the realm are fixed and ascertained by H Geo . 3 cap . 96 . '' , though fully sensible of the value of lord Hale 's opinion , knew that both he and lord Coke sometimes committed mistakes in point of law : and that ; he thought that sir Wm . Blackstone , 146 who had all their light , was a great authority too . Sir John Davis laid down such doctrines in favour of prerogative occasionally , that if any lawyer in Westminster-hill should think proper to maintain them at present , it would not much conduce to his reputation . then brought forward his amendment , stating in addition , that the weight of gold and silver was fixed by the 14th Geo . 3 , cap . 96 , which alter a short conversation was negatived . slated it to be his intention to move an amendment to the third Resolution , and he was anxious that the whole question should be adjourned . opposed the adjournment . said this was unfair , as he had never been able to get an opportunity of delivering his sentiments . called the attention of the House to his notice of a motion on the subject of Parliamentary Reform , which stood for that day . Although this was a
