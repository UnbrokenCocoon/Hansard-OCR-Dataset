made almost useless , and would require a sum of 497,748l . 12s . 1d . and a period of 15 years to complete it ; and that the petitioners had no funds for the execution of any of those works , and therefore applied for aid once more to the directors general , communicating at the same time the result of the different surveys ; and that the directors general , having examined carefully the several plans above-mentioned , naturally preferred that which could be executed at the smallest price and in the shortest time , but not having funds sufficient for the entire even of that line , desired that the Company should lay before them a proposal for proceeding as far as Ballymahon , on the line so preferred ; this being accordingly done , the estimate amounted to above 106,638l . 1s . 3d . ; and that the Grand Canal Company , having heard of the above circumstances , presented a petition to the directors general , complaining that the Royal Canal had from the beginning been an injury to them , and an encroachment on their monopoly , but that of late , by its extension and the reduction of its tolls , it had operated to their prejudice with increased effect ; and that by coming nearer to them , it must be still more injurious , and praying that no assistance should be given to the petitioners from the public money , unless they would agree to proceed in a direction farther to the northward ; and that the directors general conceived that the original question between the two companies had been long since disposed of by supreme authority , that a reduction of tolls , purchased for the public benefit , and with the public money , ought not to be turned to the injury of the petitioner '' , or made the ground for withholding any grant they might otherwise be entitled to ; and that 284 the mere circumstance of the line approaching nearer to the Grand Canal by a single mile could not be considered as a sufficient reason for the refusal of all aid , more especially as the distance between the two canals would still be 20 miles , five times as great as that which the legislature had though proper to prescribe as the limit ; and that , when the Royal Canal should have reached the Shannon , to which the Grand Canal had already arrived , the profits which both companies might be expected soon to derive from the different tracts of that great river , with which they must respectively communicate , would extinguish all competition between them ; and that the directors general accordingly ordered to the petitioners the sum of 71,092l . 0s . 10d.on the terms of their contracting to complete the Canal to Ballymahon , which order was duly approved of according to the act of Parliament ; and that , on an appeal from this order , the lord lieutenant and council were pleased to reverse it , as tending to the injury of the Grand Canal Company , an opinion founded , as the petitioners humbly conceive , not on the small deviation above-mentioned , but on a general view of the consequences expected to follow from a continuation of the Royal Canal in any line leading so far to the southward as Tarmonbury ; and that the petitioners therefore consider it as now finally determined , that they must either renounce all pretensions to aid from the directors general , or adopt the line to Roosky , which no aid within the power of that board could enable them to accomplish ; and that the petitioners bow with the humblest deference to the judgment of the lord lieutenant and council , and make no doubt that the petitioners must have flattered themselves with ill-founded hopes , but they humbly submit that they were led into this error by a combination of various circumstances , and of high authorities ; that their original undertaking was sanctioned by the legislature of Ireland , and though the Grand
