He had erroneously apprehended that the treaty was already on the table of the House , and it was but three or four days ago that he discovered his mistake . To-morrow , however , or the next day at farthest , he would take care to present it to the House , and he hoped they would accept that apology for his omission hitherto to do so . He would proceed to state the various articles of Ways and Means , by which he proposed to meet the 49,452,869l . of supply to be provided by England : WAYS AND MEANS , 1811 . Annul Duties Â£3,000,000 Surplus Consolidated Fund , 1810 1,353,715 Surplus Consolidated Fund , 1811 5,000,000 War Taxes 20,000,000 Lottery 300,000 Exchequer Bills 4,000,000 Vote of Credit 8,000,000 Loan in 6 per Cent Stock 4,981,300 in 3 and 4 per Cents 7,500,000 12,481,300 Naval Stores 420,364 49,555,379 It thus appeared that the total of Ways and Means exceeded the total of the Supply in the sum of 102,510l . The Committee would , however , expect that he would enter into an explanation of the grounds on which he calculated the surplus of the Consolidated Fund of the present year , at the sum of 5,000,000l . To do this , it would be necessary for him to detail the produce at which he estimated the various articles that went to the constitution of that fund . He took the customs at 5,134,000l ; being the average of the produce of the two last years . He had 212 taken a similar average last year , being then 4,485,333l , but in fact the Customs had produced 4,987,391l . ; being about 500,000l . beyond the calculation . So with the Excise , he proposed to take it on the average of the produce of the two last years , or 17,167,000l . Of this article he had also taken a similar average last year , being then 16,880,625l . ; but the Excise had produced 17,399,312l . This mode of calculation afforded him a fair scheme of estimate ; for although the Customs for 1811 fell short by about 200,000l . of the customs of 1810 yet the Excise for 1810 was surpassed by that of 1811 to a similar amount , the excess of the one balancing the deficiency of the other . The produce of the Assessed taxes had last year been estimated at 5,860,000l . ; they had actually produced 5,781,831l . and he would take them for the present year at 5,800,000l . The Stamp duties he had last year estimated at 5,193,000l . ; they had actually produced 5,302,743l . The great increase in these duties during the last year completely justified him in the statement which he had at that period made , that the whole charge of the year might be defrayed out of their excess . To this statement , however , he had added the observation that it was not probable the same excess would exist in the succeeding year . He should therefore take the amount of the stamps for the present year only at 5,300,000l . The Post-office revenue was estimated by him last year at 1,194,000l . the actual produce was 1,276,000l . and he proposed to take it for the present year at 1,280,000l . He could not pass over this particular article without directing the attention of the Committee to the great increase that had taken place
