can not but be anticipated that a Report of a Select Committee , with the facts and documents verified , as they might be , and going forth to the public under parliamentary authority , would contribute to a much more satisfactory result , than any discussion that could take place in a Committee of the whole House . The authorities in the one case , would direct the pursuit to still further investigation , if deemed necessary , and afford the clues of research.—In the other case , in a Committee of the whole House , assertion would be repelled merely by counter assertion , probably on very unsubstantial grounds , and but little contributing to a change of opinion on either side of the House , or without its walls . If the conduct of a governor of a distant province was arraigned on a simple motion in the House , —a public board to be reformed , and even in the case of a canal or turnpike bill , —report upon report , in innumerable folios , swelled the Journals of the House—printed at an enormous ex-pence , and becoming waste paper in almost the hour of their birth.—In questions involving the integrity of the civil and political principles of a fourth , or fifth part of our fellow subjects , arraigned , as they have been , by proceedings in this House , at successive periods , since the reformation , we have not a single page , on parliamentary authority , excepting the proceedings , supported chiefly by the evidence of those miscreants , Oates and Bedloe , which are indeed shamefully sanctioned by the imprimatur of parliament—industriously circulated through the nation , in the awful interval of the conviction and execution of lord Stafford , still further to poison the public mind , and contributing not a little , even at this hour , to countenance and give energy to the prejudices , of the great mass of the public.—Indeed within the course of the last year or two , they have been re-edited and given to the public , —in opposition to the pointed and well verified exclamation of the satirist , —speaking of the Monument of London , which , 396 Like a tall Bully , lifts its head and lies . * The production of documents and examinations in such a Committee , as had been suggested , Sir J. H. observed , might be followed by resolutions of fact , directing the attention of the public to the material points and bearings , and constituting the most satisfactory authority on which a Bill might hereafter be framed commensurate to the real exigency and justice of the case.—The adoption , qualification , or even rejection of the claims of the petitioners would thus derive a sanction not to be found in the loose discussions of successive parliamentary debates , whether in the House itself , or in a Committee of the whole House It should seem that the expedient was too rational to be questioned by any but those who were determined to resist enquiry in any shape whatever.† The result of such an enquiry must also necessarily lead ultimately to a modification , at least , of the Tests , exacted from members sitting in either House of Parliament , and revolting , indeed , against the candid judgment of every one , who has allowed his mind the fair exercise of enquiry , in the misapplication of stigmatizing and unappropriate epithets to practices innocent , at least , though not sanctioned by the establishment.—Such a reform is in- * Although this calumny has been rejected by every modern historian , a form of Prayer and a Church service , perpetuating by construction , the same unfounded charges , is annually read at St. Paul 's Cathedral , though discontinued in all other churches . † In the instance of the projected general Highway Bill , in its progress through parliament , many successive reports were printed by the House , in order to be circulated , with the Bill itself , through the country . Those reports , with
