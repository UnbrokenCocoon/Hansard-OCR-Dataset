the most part debtors to the Mother country , loudly complained of the injustice of parliament , when it enacted that paper should no longer be deemed legal tender . Lastly , we may hence learn how vain is the apprehension , generally entertained , that , by a recurrence to cash payments , we shall want a measure of exchange in all the ordinary transactions of human life ; since we find , that a currency which had existed during half a century , and extended to the minutest fractional payments , was decried after a period of four-teen months ; and that the precious metals immediately assumed the place of the former depreciated paper , without occasioning the least embarrassment to individuals , or to the State , and with incalculable benefit to the community . Having said so much , with immediate reference to the Bill , I hope I may be allowed to trouble the House with a few words concerning the effect of a depreciation , of currency , as the subject appears 1051 to me much misunderstood . It has been conceived , that the present is a question which chiefly concerns the landed interest : but , in point of fact , it relates , almost exclusively , to the public creditor , and all others who have fixed incomes ; and touches the landed proprietor no otherwise , than during the period for which his leases are granted . It must be sufficiently evident to every one who has reflected upon the subject , that , as the value of all articles depends upon their relative plenty or scarcity , whenever the currency of any community is increased , whether consisting of the precious metals , or of paper , it must represent a smaller quantity of all other articles . When this change takes place , each party naturally endeavours to shift the burthen from himself ; the landlord demands a higher rent , and obtains it , because the value of land is measured by the quantity of labour which it can command , and by no other scale ; the price of labour is in no degree affected , the value of labour being in all cases proportioned to the demand for it , and paid for , in a certain proportion of the necessaries and conveniencies of life , whatever may be the nominal values which represent that proportion . Neither are merchants and traders , who buy to sell again , in any way injured ; they only pay a greater nominal value for each commodity they purchase , which they sell again for a proportionate increase : â€”nay , in every instance , where they trade upon a borrowed capital , they are benefited , as they are enabled to acquit the original debt contracted , with a less quantity of real value . The only persons who are substantially affected and injured , are the public creditors , and all other classes of men who have fixed incomes , or are under contracts , the measure , of which is regulated by a monied price ; they have no means of casting the burthen from their own shoulders ; the amount of their receipt is fixed and limited by the engagement itself , and in reality daily decreases by becoming exchangeable for a less quantity of every other article . At first view , it might be thought that the state stands in the same relation with this class of persons , its revenue being fixed , and its expenditure dependent on the value of the labour and other articles which it has occasion to purchase ; but it will be found that so much of the revenue as consists of ad valorem duties , such as the stamps , Property 1052 Tax , and many others , rises with the depreciation of the currency ; and , above all , the state has the power of compensating itself for a depreciation in the value of its revenue , by an increase of imposts . The state , therefore , remains a gainer , on
