of credit . The Petition , purporting to be a Petition of the inhabitants of the county of Kent , in full county meeting assembled , was then presented and read ; setting forth , `` That the Petitioners , conscious of the rights they possess of addressing ; and petitioning the House upon all public affairs , and impelled by a high sense of the duty they owe to themselves and to their country , beg leave to lay before the House their opinions and sentiments on the present defective state of the Representation of the People ; that to the wisdom and justice of the original design of convening in parliament the representatives of the people to deliberate and co-operate with the sovereign and the peers upon every question of national concern , the Petitioners give their unqualified approbation ; but , when they take into their consideration the decay of some boroughs , once prosperous and well peopled , the rise and flourishing condition of others formerly of little note ; when they reflect upon the effects of the heavy and insupportable expence of elections , which closes the doors of the House to many of the best friends of their country , and robs it of their faithful service ; when the Petitioners think of these things , they are of opinion that the House is at this time by no means a fair representation of the people ; and , from the manner in which a large portion of the individual members obtain and secure their seats in the House , they can not but infer that that high and sacred office , intended for the public service , is frequently sought for and procured by unconstitutional means , and is too often perverted from its original design , and rendered subservient to private ends ; to this cause the Petitioners ascribe the greatest part of the national calamities they now have to deplore , the mean principles and narrow views which have too long governed the councils of the cabinet , the false ambition and little intrigues of its members , the continuance of a system of expenditure lavish beyond example , the 565 many disgraceful expeditions in which the blood and treasure of the country have been too prodigally wasted , the decisions of the House in direct opposition to the general sentiments of the nation , the unwillingness hitherto evinced by the House to promote enquiry into or correct the abuses in the representation , an unwillingness which can not fail to excite their distrust , and to diminish the respect the Petitioners owe to the name and functions of the House , and they deplore particularly one instance of this unwillingness of which they complain , in the rejection of a motion made in the last session of parliament by one of the members of the county of Herts , as that motion , had it been adopted , must necessarily have brought before a Committee a full enquiry into the present defective state of the representation of the people , and thereby have led to a substantial reform in the Commons House of Parliament , so essential to the salvation of the state , by restoring the blessings of a free constitution , that inestimable inheritance transmitted to us by the wisdom and intrepidity of our ancestors ; and that the times demand this open avowal of the sentiments of the Petitioners , and , in the language employed to convey them , they intend no disrespect , though they are persuaded that no words can be too strong to express their feelings on this occasion ; therefore they most earnestly intreat the House to undertake , before it is too late , in a true and cordial spirit , the measure of Reform , upon principles which , by conciliating the affections of the people , and restoring to the House its due weight and character , may rescue the country from domestic discord , and secure it from the foreign foe , give stability to the throne , and perpetuate the constitution .
