Canal Company , in their letter to the directors general , more than insinuate that that was chiefly effected by the influence of those concerned , the petitioners can not deem so unworthily of the constituted authorities , as to suppose that the great council of the nation was led from its duty by personal consideration for them ; and that , from the commencement of the Royal Canal to this hour , every step of its progress was 285 approved by the board of Inland Navigation , and though the imputation of partiality has been cast on that board also from the same quarter , yet the petitioners can not conceive that names so high and honourable stand in need of any vindication : and that even the Grand Canal Company contributed to the error into which the petitioners have fallen , as they looked in silence on the contract of 1801 , by which the petitioners were bound to proceed to Coolnahay , far from the line which leads to the northward , and also to reduce their toils , a circumstance which is now complained of as so ruinous to the Grand Canal , though the injury , if any , has happened by means which were the natural consequence of the reduction , and as such must have been then foreseen , to which it is not immaterial to add , that the Grand Canal Company had then the same rights of petitioning and appealing which they have now exerted with effect , as the whole treaty was founded on an advance of money out of the same public fund ; so that it may perhaps not be too much to infer that the Grand Canal Company willingly permitted the petitioners to advance to Coolnahay , several miles out of the line now suggested , in the hope that , after such a waste of their time , their money and their credit , a blow given to them must be mortal ; and that , whether this was so designed or not , its effects have been such as to reduce the petitioners to the necessity of now bringing forward a statement of their present condition , and of imploring the interference of the House in their favour ; and that the petitioners have , as already mentioned , completed their Canal to a distance of 46 miles ; that in so doing they have expended , with diligence and fidelity , the original subscription of 134,000l. , the grant then made of 66,000l. , the farther sum of 38,964l . raised by an increase of their stock , the loan of 25,000l. , the sum of 95,866l . 7s . 10d . purchased by the reduction of their tolls , and divers sums raised by them on debentures , as above mentioned , at several times , for no less an amount than 842,550l . ; that they are still at a considerable distance from the river Shannon , from whence their chief profits were expected to arise , and have no funds to enable them to arrive at it ; and that the general confidence in their future prosperity has hitherto afford-ed the petitioners great facility in raising money , and , looking with confidence to an increase of income sufficient to answer all 286 demands , they considered themselves well warranted in accepting the sums thus freely advanced ; but their hopes of reaching the river Shannon are now at an end ; without effecting that object they see no prospect of any considerable increase to their tolls ; and at present the whole income of the petitioners is little more than sufficient to defray the necessary charges of their establishment ; and that the stockholders of the Royal Canal Company amount to no less than 283 persons ; that it is now more than 20 years since those persons and their predecessors advanced to the funds of the Company sums amounting to 172,964l. , which in so great a length of time has produced to them little more than the common interest of their money for a single year , insomuch
