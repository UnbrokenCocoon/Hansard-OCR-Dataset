to adopt a new and dangerous course He recollected to have 78 himself , on one occasion remarked on the in sufficiency of this motive for the renewal ; but the subject did not always particularly attract the attention of the House ; it now , therefore , became them and especially since they were resolved to continue the suspension , to look well to the general principles on which both they , and the Bank proceeded , and not to consider themselves as debating merely on a temporary measure . One great security to the Bank of England , heretofore , had been its independence of the government its paper , had been properly restrained , because the government had felt no interest and taken ; no part in the extended issue of it ; and he submitted , whether , if the subserviency of large issues from the Bank to the purposes of the war , and the convenience of the state , were , during the suspension of cash payments , to be a principle recognised by , parliament , the state and the Bank might not become identified in point of interest , somewhat in the same manner as those ; government banks on the continent , whose paper had become first excessive and then depreciated . It might not be improper to take , to , slight survey of the whole period which , had passed since the first Bank restriction , bill in 1797 . Probably , in consequence as he had before shewn , of a limitation of paper which was antecedent to that æra , and perhaps in consequence also of the caution which the Bank would naturally , exercise for some time after it , the ex-changes in 1797 and 1798 were peculiarly favourable , and a great tide of gold flowed into the country . In the year 1800 and 1801 , when the scarcity of corn occurred—a commercial event more likely , per-haps , than any other to prejudice the exchange—the tide turned quite as much. , against us : the exchanges then fell below the point which they had ever reached ; while the Bank was open . The Bank did not at that time limit its issues , which it certainly would have done if it had been liable to make its payments in cash . The exchange , however , recovered itself , in 1802 , but it did not improve so much as , to bring back gold into the country After a few more years , the exchange turned much against us ; and it had now for the space of nearly three years , continued more unfavourable than it was ever known to be before the suspension Thus the only influx of gold , of which we had had the benefit , since the suspen- 79 sion act of 1797 , was , apparently , in consequence of a limitation of paper antecedent to that period . There would naturally be a tendency to excess during the suspension of cash payments ; but the first consequences of such excess , as well as the peculiar pressure of 1801 and 1802 , would undoubtedly be mitigated by the exportation of a large portion of that immense fund of gold , with which the providence of the time preceding the suspension had enriched us ; and the recovery of the exchange in 1802 was thus facilitated . When the second great pressure , of 808 and 1809 , arose , it found us stripped of a great part of our coin ; and this probably was the reason why it proved so serious . It soon carried off our little remaining gold ; and we were therefore now arrived at a period when we were no longer protected against the most fearful fall of our exchanges . As long as the foreigner knew that the bill on England which he bought , could be turned into cash , which cash was of a given value , and subject , though contrary to law , to be transported , there was a limit to the depression
