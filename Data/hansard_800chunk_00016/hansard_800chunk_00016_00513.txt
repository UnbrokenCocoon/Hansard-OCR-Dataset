yearly payments , he would receive only gold or paper estimated by the price of gold in the market . This notice , whether intentionally or otherwise he did not presume to determine , was not declared , till the time when it was well known that Parliament was on the point of separating . He did not mean to insinuate that the noble lord was actuated with any other views than such as became his rank and station in society . He did not wish to attribute any improper motives in supposing him to be influenced by his own theories on the subject , and a desire of enforcing them by practical examples . The impression on his mind when he first heard of the circumstance , which was before it was mentioned in Parliament , was that it did not of itself call for any legislative interference to guard against any consequences which it might occasion . He was then persuaded , that a system which had so long existed , and under which the country had so long prospered , might safely be left to stand upon its own merits , and to support its character without the aid of any parliamentary enactment . He felt , indeed , that the conduct of the noble lord was certainly productive of some alarm , but not of a size or nature to alter his opinion , until he found to his surprize , that instead of being discountenanced and condemned by all those whose opinions 885 would have been likely to have an effect on that noble lord , it was defended and extolled as just , and even as patriotic . He had conceived , that the noble lord , finding no encouragement from the opinions , any more than from the conduct of his friends , would have at length seen the propriety of desisting from his purpose . It was probable , he thought , that when the noble lord reflected that those whose conduct had previously resembled his own , were exclusively pedlars , and Jews , and smugglers , he would not persevere .

No doubt the noble lord himself thought he was acting a most admirable part , and one that reflected on him the highest credit , but at the same time he would declare that he could conceive no act whatever , that in proportion to the limited sphere of an individual was calculated to produce such formidable effects against the interests of society , as that of the noble lord which had imposed on them the necessity of adopting the present Bill.â€”He had now stated the reasons which had induced ministers to decline pressing any measure of this description , and , he trusted , sufficiently proved the injustice of the reproaches which had been urged against them on this account . It had appeared to him impossible , that the old adherents of Mr. Pitt , and those who had approved of the Restriction in 1797 , could oppose a measure formed on the same principle , and rendered necessary by similar causes of a more extended operation ; or that the supporters of Mr. Fox , on the other hand , could disapprove of a Bill , the professed object of which was to prevent what they so much deprecated , the establishment of two prices . Those who had maintained the opinions of the Bullion Committee , and in particular he wished to allude to the hon .
