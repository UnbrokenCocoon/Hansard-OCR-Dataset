the subject is entitled to claim at our hands . I might doubt , when this Bill was first introduced into the other House of Parliament , whether the necessity for taking any legislative measure upon the subject , was sufficiently made out ; but , when the noble lord candidly and honourably avowed and justified , in his place in parliament , his intended enforcement of the notice he had given ; and when the probability of an example from a quarter so respectable being followed by others , justified as it had been in argument , was weighed , I own I could no longer doubt that it be- 954 came parliament , before it separated , if not to supply a complete remedy against every possible misapplication of the law to compel payments of such a nature , to provide some measure , which might at least protect the tenant during the recess , and mark the disposition of parliament , if the protect the should hereafter be persevered in , to meet it with corresponding correctives : the equitable claim of the tenant and all other debtors being , in my judgment , distinctly this , that so long as the law shall continue to prevent the Bank of England from paying their notes in cash , so long ought the legislature , by special enactment , to interpose and stay process , either against the person or property of debtors , who shall tender Bank notes to their creditors in satisfaction of their demands . But to return to the injustice of the arrangement itself : I will assume , for the sake of argument with lord King , that , in a lease granted before the year 1797 , the landlord 's interest has been disturbed by late events to his prejudice , and to the advantage of his tenant , and that he is equitably entitled to some indemnity ( the reality of which case I beg I may not be understood however to admit ) , I still must contend , that the principle upon which my lord King has laid claim to measure the extent of the indemnity , is an unjust one . His lordship assumes its equity , as it is no more than requiring a specific performance of the covenant , with certain voluntary relaxations of it on his part , for the accommodation of the tenant ; but I contend , that the equity of enforcing the specific performance of such a covenant ceased with the first enactment of the restriction act , and that the conditions on which it is now proposed to be relaxed , subject the tenant to an increase of rent , not to be regulated upon any fairly ascertained change of value in the Bank paper of the country , for which alone the farmer sells his produce , but which is to be governed , either by the price of guineas , which must rise in proportion to their scarcity , were even the purchase of them permitted by law ; or by the price of gold , which has been raised 20 per cent . by the disturbed state of our intercourse with the Continent , and may be indefinitely raised . If such a criterion is to be admitted to regulate the additional payment to be made in notes , what tenant can foresee what rent he may not be called on to pay ? All he knows is , that it is not a fixed and determinate amount 955 of the prevailing currency of the country , but that it depends on the extent of our expenditure abroad , the balance of commercial payments , and the state of the exchanges , which must always govern the price of gold , whether the additional amount of rent , which he is subject to ( if he is indulged with the permission to pay in banknotes at all . ) shall be 20 , 30 , 50 , or 100 per cent . beyond the rent specified in his lease ; for who can say , in the present
