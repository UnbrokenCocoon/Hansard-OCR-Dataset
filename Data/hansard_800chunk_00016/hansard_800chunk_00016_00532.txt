, for the perfect security of all persons who shall at any time become possessed of any such credit as aforesaid , it is expedient that triplicate correspond- 913 ing entries be made , the first of which shall be on the Bank hook at such place , the second of which shall be delivered to the person who shall have brought the Bank notes as a certificate of the proper entry having been made , and the third of which shall be forthwith transmitted to the original Bank of England in London , in order to be by them filed and daily transmitted to the Tower of London , for safe custody , after such last mentioned triplicate shall have been duly recorded in the books at the Bank of England itself , and that every transfer be made in like manner . 14 . `` That , as under proper regulations in detail , such book entries and such book transfers can not ever be forged , it would be highly expedient that the law should authorise legal tenders to be made , by tendering such a book transfer as aforesaid of the sum due in such form and manner as shall hereafter be prescribed by law . '' strongly objected to their lordships adopting any proceeding whatever , in the present instance , with regard to the propositions of his noble friend . He should rather think what his noble friend meant was , that what he now said should be regarded as a species of notice of his intention to submit such propositions on some future day , than as expressive of his desire to obtain a vote of the House on topics of such extent , importance , and magnitude , without any previous notice being given , in the present circumstances of the session , or in an attendance so extremely thin as the present . For his part , he could not agree in acceding to any propositions which involved the supposition of the insolvency of the Bank of England .
