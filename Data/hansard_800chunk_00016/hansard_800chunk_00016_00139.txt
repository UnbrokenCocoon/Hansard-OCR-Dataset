of justice . asked if any notice had been given by the noble earl of his intention to bring Mr. Palmer 's case before their lordships that evening ? If not , he did not think it fair to enter upon the discussion in so thin a House . Besides , their lordships would do well to consider in what difficulties they might involve themselves by objecting to the vote . confessed he had given no notice of his intention to mention the circumstance to the House , but had brought it under their consideration merely from what he conceived to be his duty . Neither had he any intention of renewing the question , but should leave it to any noble lord whom it might please to take it up . After a few words in explanation from the Lord Chancellor and the earl of Lauderdale , the subject was cropped without further notice . presented a Petition from the freeholders and inhabitants of the county of Tipperary , comprising persons professing various religious persuasions , setting forth , `` That the petitioners , being actuated by sentiments of attachment to the true principles of the constitution , and sincerely desirous to promote the internal concord and general prosperity of the country by every measure of conciliation , good will , and justice towards all classes and descriptions of their fellow subjects , beg leave to represent to the House , that they view , with particular regret and disapprobation , the existing code of penal and disabling statutes , which aggrieve and degrades the Roman Catholics of these realms adhering to the faith of their fore-fathers ; and that this obnoxious code , at all times unjust in its principle , and violating an ancient and solemn treaty , appears to us , at this critical period of national exigency , to be peculiarly ill-timed and unwise , and that , besides infringing the sacred rights of private conscience , and violating the first principles of legislation , it insults and depresses every individual of the Catholic community , stigmatizes them as unworthy of confidence , and proscribes them as aliens in their native land ; and that thus disuniting the people , thus prolonging needless dissentions , and alienating the great majority of the Irish population from the state , this code is the certain source of national weakness and imminent public danger : without the zealous co-operation of the Catholic community , that right arm of Ireland , no reflecting man can confidently reckon upon an effectual resistance to the common foe in the trying hour of peril ; and it is but natural to presume that such co-operation will be best ensured by augmenting their interest in the maintenance of the constitution , by extending to them its full benefits without reserve or restriction , by acts of substantial justice , and even of marked kindness , towards this faithful and well-deserving people , from whom , perhaps , within a very short period , the most arduous services , and of inestimable value , will be necessarily and anxiously demanded ; and that the petitioners are of opinion , therefore , that no other measure can so effectually tend to the firm defence and 272 preservation of these islands , to internal union and general security , as a full and complete restoration of all the rights and benefits of the constitution to the Catholic people ; justice no less than sound policy demands the immediate adoption of this measure ; liberty of conscience , and the unfettered exercise of private judgment in the choice of religion , are the inalienable birthright of every man , and can not be invaded by human power without disrespect to that merciful Deity who tolerates all religions , and graciously accepts from all men the genuine worship of the heart in whatsoever language , and under every form ; and that the experience of nation '' has also shown that intolerance can never be practised with impunity ; in its gloomy train are ever to be found national discord , disgrace , decay , and finally desolation
