during the last two or three years in the receipts at the Post-office . In 1809 , the Post-office had produced 1,083,000l . ; in 1810 , 1,194,000l . ; and in 1811 , 1,276,000l . being an increase on the average of about 90,000l . a year , and that not from any additional duties on postage , but simply from the augmented commercial communication of the country . It was clear , therefore , that by taking the amount for the present year only , at 1,280,000l . an opportunity was afforded to parliament , if they should think it wise and expedient to avail themselves of it , to relieve Scotland , and other distant parts of the empire , without the danger of any diminution of the estimated revenue . The Hawkers and Pedlars , and sundry small branches of the 213 revenue he would take at 106,000l . ; Personal Estates and Pensions at 156,000l . ; the Land Tax at 1,038,000l . ; the Surplus Exchequer Fees at 54,000l . ; the Tontine at 24,000l . ; the Crown Lands , & c. at 66,000l . and the Imprest Monies at 200,000l . making the total of the estimated receipt of the existing permanent taxes for the present year , 36,322,000l.â€”To this must be added 2,240,000l . ; being the amount of the war taxes appropriated to the Consolidated Fund ; and the grand total would be 38,562,000l . ; which being deducted from the estimated produce of the Consolidated Fund , would leave a balance of 5,649,000l . He would , however , take the surplus only at 5,000,000l . and would presently account for the disposal of the balance . With the exception of last year , when the surplus of the Consolidated Fund was 5,753 715l . ; of the preceding year , when ( from peculiar circumstances ) it amounted to 7,019,774l . ; and of the year 1803 , when it was 5,936,651l . that surplus had at no period exceeded , or even reached 5,000,000l . This was a highly satisfactory circumstance , in contemplating the state of the finances of the country . The next item which he thought might require some explanation , was the amount of the estimate for the War Taxes for the year ending the 5th April , 1812 . This estimate was 20,484,000l . The grounds on which he calculated he would state as briefly as possible : The average produce of the Custom and Excise war duties for the last three years was 9,296,805l . The produce of the last year was 9,727,213l . ; but he thought it better to take the average of the three last years . Four , hundred thousand pounds remained due from the East India Company . These sums , added together , made 9,696,805l . The next produce of the assessment of the Property Tax for the year ending April 5 , 1811. was estimated at 1 1,800,000l . This was 400,000l . more than the sum calculated upon as the probable produce , though less than the produce of the preceding year , on account of the great amount of arrears received in that year . The amount of the outstanding arrears of the Property Tax from 1804 to 1810 , was 2,246,644l . Of this sum , it was expected that a part would be returned by schedules , and part might not be recoverable ; he would suppose one-fourth , or 560,000l . Deducting this , the amount , therefore , of outstanding arrears that might be expected to be received , was 1,686,644l . of the estimated produce of the duty for 214 the year ending the 5th of April , 1811 , ( namely 11,800,000l ) , 4,864,267l . had been received : 6,935,732l . therefore remained to be received . This , added to the l,686,644l expected to be received of the arrears of former years , made 8,622,000l . ; which , with the estimated nett produce of the assessment of the present year , which he would take at the same as the last , namely
