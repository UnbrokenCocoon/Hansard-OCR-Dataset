200,000l . ; and that , for an object of so great public utility , it was conceived reasonable to solicit the sanction and aid of the legislature ; and accordingly , in the said year , petitions were presented to both Houses of Parliament , 279 subscribed by many of the first names in the land , offering , on behalf of themselves and others , to engage in this great undertaking , from whence the population , the commerce , the agriculture , and the wealth of the country were likely to derive so vast an increase ; stating the line and level by which they conceived the plan might be accomplished , and praying some aid from the revenues of the nation which was so much interested in the event ; and that there was then in Ireland a company incorporated some time before under the name of the Grand Canal Company , for the purpose of conducting a navigable canal from Dublin to a more southern part of the same river , a work in which they had then made some progress ; and that the members of that company , alarmed at the idea of competition , petitioned both Houses of Parliament against the proposed undertaking , as an encroachment on that monopoly , the hope of which , as they alledged , had induced them to proceed so far ; and that the matter of both the said petitions was much canvassed in parliament ; and to the objection made by the Grand Canal Company it was answered , that the Shannon was river of vast extent , flowing through countries of great fertility , abounding with mines of various descriptions , and wanting nothing but facility of conveyance to diffuse wealth and industry over the nation ; that nature has divided this great river into two tracts of perhaps equal value , separated from each other by a lake called Lough Ree , into which the river spreads , and of which the navigation has too much of difficulty and danger for river-boats to encounter ; that the Grand Canal would connect the southern tract with the metropolis and the coast ; of Great Britain , while the proposed navigation would afford the same advantages to the northern part of the river , and thus , without hazard of competition , an object was held forth to each sufficient to excite their zeal and industry , and , by means of both , a complete system of internal communication would be farmed to the unspeakable advantage of the country ; after a full consideration of the subject , the legislature decided in favour of the proposed canal to Tarmonbury ; and by an act then passed , 29 Geo . 3 , c. 33 , for the promotion and encouragement of inland navigation , amongst several clauses of a similar nature , a sum of 06,000l . was granted under the terms therein mentioned to such persons as were or should be undertakers for completing 280 the said canal ; and that , by his Majesty 's royal letters patent , bearing date at Dublin the 1st day of October , in the 29th year of his Majesty 's reign , several noblemen and gentlemen , by name , and all such persons as then had or thereafter should have any share in the joint stock therein mentioned , were incorporated in the usual form under the name of the Royal Canal Company ; and it was thereby provided , that their capital stock should be 200,000l. , to wit , 66,000l . so granted , and I 134,000l . to be subscribed by the individual members , who were thereby empowered to complete the said navigation from certain parts of Dublin therein specified to or near Tarmonbury aforesaid by a line to be carried on through or near Kilcock , Kinnegad , and Mullingar , and for that purpose to purchase and hold all such lands , buildings , goods , and chattels , as should be necessary , and to alien or sell the same , or any part thereof ,
