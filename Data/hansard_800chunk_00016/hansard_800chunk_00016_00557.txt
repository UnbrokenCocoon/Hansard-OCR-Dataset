and still less in the latter case , where the rent was fixed , the prohibition on the Bank being then in existence , and no intimation given to the tenant of any intended departure from the established practice of accepting Bank notes in discharge of the rent at par . If the grounds on which the landlord considers that his interests have been affected , had originated in any act for which his tenant could be deemed responsible , or if it had grown out of the ordinary course of events , which the parties to the contract might be bound to advert to , in making their bargain , I can understand the claim to compel the tenant to submit to a new mode of payment , so infinitely disadvantageous ; but , when the tenant has done nothing , and parliament every thing ( parliament having acted for the public good , upon which it is the province of parliament exclusively to decide ) , I do not see upon what principle of justice , one party can expect to receive his full share in the advantage resulting from a measure of general policy , throwing all the inconveniences of it upon the other party to the contract . But let us see how far the sense of parliament has been already declared upon this principle , not merely in the speeches of individuals , but on the face of the Restriction act itself . That act expressly provides that the notes of the Bank of England shall be received as cash in all revenue payments , thereby constituting them a legal tender in all debts from the 950 subject to the State . It may be said , that , for the state to lend this aid to the credit of Bank paper , might be a very wise expedient , that it operated as an indulgence , which , where the debt was due to the state , the state was competent to confer , and that no contract was violated , or individual right thereby injured ; but what was the provision made by law with respect to the dividends payable to the public creditor ? It is true no express enactment declared that Bank-notes should constitute a legal tender in such payments , but no exception was made in favour of the public creditor in the prohibition against cash payments , and , in point of fact , he has had no other option since that Bill passed , but to accept Bank-notes at par , or to remain unpaid . Here then was a matter of contract of the most sacred description , between the public and individuals , upon which the law declared , that payment in coin should not be demandable during the continuance of the Bank Restriction act . Can it be contended that the legislature meant in matters of contract , that one law should prevail between the public and the individual , and another between private persons r that the public was to receive an indulgence from their creditors in the nature of their payment , which the individual debtor had no claim to expect from his creditor ? I am aware it has been argued , that , supposing an act of national bankruptcy to have already been committed towards the public creditor , that can form no motive or justification for authorising a similar violation of contract between man and man . I shall hereafter have to deny , that any such failure in the equitable discharge of its engagements can be imputed to the state . I am confident , that the framers of the law did not so interpret its Operations ; and if , from the necessity of the case , the legislature felt itself compelled to take from the public creditor the means of receiving coin in satisfaction of his demand , is there any imaginable principle of equity , upon which it could mean to compel individuals to do that , which the state was unable to perform ? or , to state the fact more truly , that having
