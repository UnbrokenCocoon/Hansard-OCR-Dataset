and there had been of late years a greater fluctuation in the price of that article than the addition of this duty would effect , notwithstanding which , it had continued to prosper . There was , besides , an immediate quantity on our hands , and much would be obtained from different parts . As to the duty upon timber , he was prepared to expect the effect described by the hon . gentleman , and had provided against any failure by a larger estimate . said , that if any inconvenience was to occur which might prevent the importation of cotton wool from America , it might be brought from the East Indies to any amount . stated , that the cotton which ; came from India sold at 8d . a pound , 223 while that from America sold at 12d . The coarser could not supply the place of the finer . The produce of our own colonies was extremely limited in this respect ; and it should be well considered whether it was right to give a preference to the cotton of the Brazils above the cotton of America . The Resolutions were then agreed to . said , he should not occupy the time of the Committee to any great length , but would proceed directly to the subject of the Ways and Means for Ireland . The interest of the debt was 4,279,000l . and the estimated vote of the present year , 6,569,000l . Ireland had been deficient in the last year , 1,866,000l . making , in Irish money , 2,011,000l . The surplus of the Consolidated Fund for the last year was 740,000l . the revenue of the year was 4,500,000l . a loan had been negociated at 2,500,000l . An act had been passed for raising 1,000,000l . by Treasury Bills , and 4,500,000l . was raised in Great Britain , making in the whole 13,615,713l . which left 200,000l . beyond the Supply . He then proceeded to state the Ways and Means for meeting the interest of these sums . It was not his intention , as his right hon . friend had already stated , to raise taxes in Ireland , under the present circumstances of that country , to the whole amount . The measure by which he was relieved from that necessity was a proof not only of great liberality , but of great wisdom ; and as Ireland was a country of ample resources they might look forward to a future period , when she would be able to discharge the obligation . The taxes he should propose were not many ; he had laid down one principle , which , as often as it could with convenience be resorted to , he was desirous to adopt , and that was the equalization of the taxes of Ireland with those of England , in the correspondent articles . There was one article which had always been a subject of taxation in Ireland , ever since a tax was known there , he meant tobacco ; the tax at present was Jess in that country than in Great Britain ; and he should propose to make it equal . The produce of this he estimated at 221,000l . The next tax was on hemp , which he intended to increase also up to the British standard . This would give a sum of 8,000l . and both together would make 229,000l . Of this sum 150,000l . would meet the charge upon the 2 500,000l . loan , at six per cent . and 50,000l . the in- 224 terest upon the 1,000,000l . Treasury Bill at five per cent . leaving a surplus of . 29,000l.â€”There were two other taxes he should propose , without relying on them much , as he did not conceive they were likely to produce any important addition of revenue . The first was to place the duty on Timber imported from the United States of America on the same footing with that imported from other foreign countries . The United States were now on the same footing
