prelates of the establishment , who necessarily ought to take a material part in such an investigation . He should have moved as an instruction to such a Committee , that they should examine and report the state of the existing statutes as bearing on the Roman Catholics of the United Kingdom : those framed in the days of our Catholic ancestors , which are still to be ranked among the most salutary , and wisely framed , as applying checks to foreign encroachment : and those subsequent to the Reformation , of which that of the 13th of Eliz . cap . 2 , is the most prominent , offering , as he had more than once observed in the House , a formidable barrier against encroachment , but of impracticable application from its unqualified and sanguinary tendency , and indeed wholly inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Act of the 31st of his present Majesty , inasmuch as recourse to the see of Rome is , in certain cases , indispensably essential to the practice of the Roman Catholic religion . In a select Committee the numerous recorded declarations of Roman Catholics , clergy and others , avowing the integrity of their civil principles , might be satisfactorily examined with a reference to those canons of general and provincial councils , which have been so often adverted to , and so differently construed ; and it is impossible to discuss this question adequately , much less to legislate upon it , without such a reference . Those declarations of principles have been made and presented to government , by the Catholics of Great Britain and Ireland , at various periods , from the date of the Reformation to the present day . Catholics contend , that their demeanour , as Catholics , have been uniformly consistent with those declarations , but they protest against the inferences drawn from the mistaken conduct of individuals who may have been perverted from their duty and allegiance . The better to substantiate the conclusions to be drawn from such documents , the evidence of prelates and other clergy of the Roman Catholic communion , of those immediately exercising the functions of vicars apostolic within the realm , as well as of other eminent prelates of different Catholic states , at present residing in this country , might be easily resorted to , — 393 and this seems to be the more expedient , at the present moment , when the last petition to parliament of the English Roman Catholics , founded on a solemn resolution of a meeting of the principal Roman Catholic nobility , gentry , clergy and others , including five English prelates , declaratory of their assent to `` any arrangement founded on the basis of mutual satisfaction and security , '' has been dissented from by one of the English Roman Catholic prelates , and that dissent and opposition been qualified by a synod of the Roman Catholic prelates of Ireland , with the terms of `` Apostolical firmness , '' and `` a `` faithful discharge of duty . '' And further , as the same dissenting prelate has averred , that those prelates who actually signed this resolution , so reprobated by himself and the Roman Catholic bishops of Ireland , have actually abandoned their own opinions , thus solemnly attested , and that there is now an uniformity of sentiment existing among the whole body of Roman Catholic clergy , on this head , opposed to their previous declaration . If this assertion be true , unquestionably but little reliance ought to be placed on such declarations , —it is fair , however , to state that this change of opinion is not admitted by the subscribing Roman Catholic prelates of England , who all deprecate the injurious tendency of such assertions , both as respecting themselves and the public . The memorable transaction of the questions put to six universities on the continent , at the instance of Mr. Pitt in 17S8 , with their answers , pointedly recognizing the integrity of the social , civil , and political principles of Catholics
