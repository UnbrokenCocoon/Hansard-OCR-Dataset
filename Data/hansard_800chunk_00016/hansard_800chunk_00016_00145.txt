at their pleasure ; and that it having been found , on examination , that the course prescribed by the said charter was ineligible , and that some farther powers were necessary , an act was in the ensuing year ( 30 Geo . 3 , c. 20 ) passed in the said parliament , intituled , `` An act for the better enabling the Royal Canal Company to carry on and complete the Royal Canal from the city of Dublin to Tarmonbury on the river Shannon , '' whereby a new line is prescribed for the said canal in Dublin and the parts near thereto ; and the said canal is directed to be carried on to or near Tarmonbury by a line near Lucan , Leixlip , Maynooth , Kilcock , Kinnegad , and Mullingar , still adhering to Tarmonbury as the ultimate destination , and guarding , the rights of the Grand Canal Company by a clause prohibiting any approach with in a shorter distance than lour miles from their canal , but with that restriction , leaving to the discretion of the Royal Canal Company those deviations which unforeseen circumstances might from time to time suggest ; and that the Royal Canal was shortly after begun near the circular road of Dublin , and carried on in the direction appointed , but before it had extended any considerable distance the whole of the 200,000l . was expended ; and that , although the original estimates thus plainly appeared to have been fallacious , it was a fallacy in which the company had no other concern than the misfortune of being the principal sufferers by it , the expenditure ( which alone was their province ) , had been faith- 281 fully made ; and so plain did this appear , that , under the provisions of an act made in the year 1798 , a farther sum of 25,000l was advanced as a loan by the public to the company , on the terms of their binding themselves by recognizance to complete their canal to Thomastown , a distance from Dublin of 33 miles ; and that , after expending on the works the said sum of 25,000l . and a further sum of 90,000l . raised by the company for the purpose , they once more found themselves in want of money to enable them to proceed ; and that , for obtaining such money , the first expedient which occurred was an application for aid to the directors general , at whose disposal a sum of 500,000l . had been then recently placed by the legislature for the advancement of in-land navigation in Ireland ; and that the directors general , conceiving themselves bound to obtain the best terms in their power for the public , proposed to grant a sum of 95,806l . 7s . 10d . to the company on the terms of their reducing for ever the tolls of their canal in no instance less than one third , on some specified articles two thirds , and on potatoes brought from Dublin no less than five sixths of the former rate ; it was farther required that the company should engage to extend their canal at both its extremities , so as to have it complete from the river Liffey and Constitution hill , in the city of Dublin , to the town of Coolnahay : and that a cut should be made from the canal to communicate with Lough Owell , a body of the purest water , so situate as to command the summit level , and sufficient to supply the whole canal from Dublin to Tarmonbury , and so extensive , that it has since enabled them permanently to supply the pipes by which the northern half of Dublin is provided with water : this proposal was accepted ; the terms were reduced into the form of a contract , which bears dale November 3d 1801 , and that contract has been completely fulfilled , on the 2Sth day of December in the year 1808 , the whole of the works so stipulated was complete , which was
