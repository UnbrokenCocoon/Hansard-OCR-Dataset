Committee to do that which he recommended ? The duty on British spirits had been founded on a principle which had over and over again been recognized by the Committee as just . After the experience of last year , namely , having found that spirits had continued to be sold at the increased price to which they were raised when distilled from sugar , there were no reasons to suppose there would be any diminution in the con sumption of the article from the very small advance on the price which the presen duty could be expected to occasion . With respect to the other duties , they were all recommended to the Committee , on views very different from those con- 220 nected with finance . They were proposed expressly for the purposes of endeavouring to procure for British shipping those imports , which the war in which the country was engaged , necessarily limited ( and which were now enjoyed by foreigners ) ; and of encouraging the exertions of British manufactures , and the consumption of British colonial produce . Policy would have dictated these measures without any reference whatever to their , beneficial tendency with respect to finance . He was therefore justified in saying that Ireland might be assisted without prejudice to Great Britain , and he trusted that the assistance would be received in Ireland as it would be given in this country ; namely , as affording a mark of our disposition to lend every possible aid to Ireland under the embarrassed circumstances in which she was placed , and as tending to enforce the necessity and the policy of either country stepping to the support of the other , when the one was able to give , and the other so situated as to require assistance . He believed that he had now stated , as fully and distinctly as he had it in his power to do , ail the considerations immediately connected with the subject before the Committee . He trusted that he had not omitted any necessary explanation ; but before he sat down , he wished to mention a few circumstances , in order to shew the general increase of the revenue , and the affluence of the country . For this ? purpose he begged the attention of the Committee to the increasing produce of the Customs and Excise , during the last five years . In the year ending the 5th : April 1807 , the produce of the customs was 9,012,000l . in 1808 , 9,123,612l . in 1809 , 8,508,258l . in 1810 , 10 536,775l . and in 1811 , 10,523,169l . being an in crease of near a million since the year 1807 . The produce of the excise in the year ending 5th April 1807 , was ; 23,740,518l . ; in 1811 , 24,046,022l . In the intermediate years the advance was gradual , with the exception of 1809 , in ; which year there was a considerable falling off , the produce being only 22,837,856l In the two succeeding years , however , this depression was completely recovered A inquiry into other articles of general consumption , would contribute to show ; the increasing opulence of the nation . The produce of the duties on cotton wool imported into the country in 1807 , was : 543,526l . ; the produce in the year 1811 , 221 was 1,034,142l . The duties on deals and fir timber imported in 1807 , were 566,247l . In 1811 they amounted to 642,104l . The excise duties on tea in 1807 , were 2,844,395l . In 1811 they amounted to 3,236,027l . This last was a more extraordinary increase , as the article was under most heavy taxation , and as the increase took place after the operation , from which so much mischief was anticipated , of the reduced duty on coffee . All this could be accounted for only by the general augmentation of wealth in the country . Of this increasing wealth a most striking instance was afforded in the consumption of wine . In 1785 the quantity
