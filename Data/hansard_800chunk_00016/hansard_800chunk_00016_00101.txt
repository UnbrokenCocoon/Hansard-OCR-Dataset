, 11,800,000l. , gave 20,422,000l . From this , however , must be deducted the sum of 7,524,000l . remaining to complete the grant of is 10 , leaving a balance of 12,898 000l . to be received on account of the property tax . Let this be added to the estimate of the war taxes , 9,690,805l . and the result would be 22,59 4,805l . There were war taxes , however , to the amount of 2,240,000l . already pledged for the interest of the debt , and which must therefore be deducted , leaving the balance to be received 20,354,805l . He would , however , take it at 20,000,000l . He now came to the consideration of the Loan , and of the Ways and Means in aid of the revenue to meet the expences of the year . He had already explained to the Committee the state of the Loan made in the 5 per cent . stock , and the Exchequer Bills funded in the present session . These amounted altogether to 12,000,000l . by which a capital was created in the 5 per centum stock of 12,444,711l . The interest on this capital was 622,235l . The Sinking Fund 124,447l . The charges of management 3,733l . making a total of 750,416l . to be annually provided for , for the loan in the 5 per cents . By the loan of 7,500,000l . for which he had that morning contracted , a total charge would be incurred of 465,403l . 10s . The capital created was 7,500,000l . in the 3 per cents , reduced ; 1,500,000l . in the consols , and 1 500,000l . in the 4 per cents . For each hundred pounds subscribed , the subscribers were to have 100l . in the 3 per cents , reduced , 20l . in the consols , 20l . in the 4 per cents , and 6s . 11d . in the long annuities . By a calculation made on the price of stocks on the Saturday before , it appeared that the 100l . in the 3 per cents , reduced , which was on that day 64⅛th , was equal to 64l . 2s . 6d . That the twenty pound in the consols , which were at 65⅛th , was equal-to 13l . 0s . 6d . and the 20l . 4 per cent . which was at 80⅛th , was equal to 16l ; These sums amounted to 93l . 3s 6d ; and if to this were added the value of the us . 6s.11d . long annuities , namely , 5l . 17s . 10d . 215 the whole would be found to amount to 99l . is.4d . There was a discount , however , of 3 per cent . on the payment of nine months , amounting to 2l . 6s . 6d . and there would , therefore , be a bonus of it Is . nod on every hundred pounds subscribed . He apprehended that a more favourable I an to the public than the present could hardly have been expected ; and he had the satisfaction to state to the House that he understood that it was already at a premium of 1l . 10s . per cent . It had been conracted also with the expectaion that the funds were in such a state as to afford every reasonable hope of an improvement , rather than of a diminution of the advantages to the subscribers . The amount of the interest on this last loan would be 355,937l . 10s . ; of the Sinking Fond 106,112l . ; of the charges of management , 3,344l . making a total of 465,403l . 10s . which added to the total of the other loan , made the grand total of charge on the two loans , 1,215,819l . The rate per centum , including all charges paid by the public , was , on the 7,500,000l . loan , 6l . 4s . l¼d ; on the 12,000,000l . funded , 6l 5s . 0¾d . The rate
