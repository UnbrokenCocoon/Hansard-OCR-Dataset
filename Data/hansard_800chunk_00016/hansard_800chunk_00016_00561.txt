obstructed state of our intercourse with the Continent , when freedom of circulation is at an end , to what extent the price of that article may not rise , namely gold , which is the only commodity , which when it has evaded the vigilance of the enemy , and reached the Continent , can expect , as an article of property , effectually to secrete itself , and to escape being either confiscated or burnt . Can it be contended for a moment , that it should depend on the caprice or power of the enemy , or upon the extent of military expenditure , which his own government may think fit to carry on abroad , whether a tenant , holding lands upon lease , shall pay more or less rent ? yet such must be the result , if the principle contended for by lord King is admitted . I would put the issue of the whole argument upon this simple question , and allow the noble lord to answer it himself , whether if his tenant had been apprized , previously to his signing the lease , that such a stale of things would have arisen , within the period of the contract ; that it might continue for an indefinite length of time ; that in such case , bank-notes would not be accepted in discharge of the rent agreed upon ; but that he must either find guineas , when the Bank was prohibited from issuing coin ; or pay an increased rent in notes equivalent to whatever increased price gold might rise to , under the operation of the Berlin and Milan decrees , and the expense of the war in the Peninsula ; whether , upon such a statement , the tenant would have signed the lease at the rent then agreed on , making his person and pro perty liable for the fulfilment of so indefinite , and perhaps so ruinous a bargain ? But I contend for it , if lord King 's rent were paid in gold , as he proposes , or in notes with the additional sum calculated according to the market price of gold , that he would obtain an undue advantage , proportioned to the excessive price which gold now bears . He may say , that the rent agreed on was a rent in gold ; nominally 956 it was , but not in practice , as understood between the parties ; but even as a rent in gold , it was a rent in coin not saleable nor exportable , instead of a rent in Portugal gold coin , or standard gold , as proposed by his lordship 's notice , both of which are exportable , and sell in the market at four shillings an ounce higher than the gold , which can not be sworn off for exportation ; so that , even in this light , the demand is unreasonable ; the augmentation of rent thus imposed may not be beyond the power of the tenant to pay , his bargain having become a profitable one , from the lapse of his term : but this progressive benefit the landlord can have no pretence to share ; we must presume it was purchased in the original terms agreed on . The tenant 's bargain can not be proved to be a better one now , regard being had to the prices obtained for produce , than it was in the year 1808 ; yet then there was nothing in the state of the exchanges nor price of gold , which enabled my lord King to assume , that bank-notes were depreciated , or to demand , upon the principle of his notice , an increased rent if paid in notes . Is it then reasonable , if no peculiar profit has accrued to the tenant in the last two years , that he should be liable , holding under a lease , to an increase of 20 per cent . on his rent , with a chance of being still further raised , merely because an adverse exchange ,
