, in relation to a Protestant state , would also become a most important subject of enquiry , as respecting the authority by which they are substantiated ; —but in reference to the particulars of this transaction Sir J. H. said , he would speak further before he sat down . Questions of the same nature had been submitted to the universities on the continent , at different periods , since the Reformation ; their answers were found to be uniform as to the subject of civil and political duties , and they would form a useful and satisfactory head of enquiry . In such a Committee—the important and essential distinction between canons of faith , and regulations of discipline , might also be satisfactorily discussed ; —practically constituting as it does the key-stone of the arch which supports the integrity of Catholic allegiance in a Protestant state . then went into considerable details of observation on the obligatory operation of such canons , and their supposed influence on the civil constitution of a state ; he could well anticipate much that would fall from the right hon . civilian , on the opposite side of the House , on this head of general councils and papal rescripts , especially in reference to his favourite theme of the fourth Lateran Council . But again he must observe that decrees of discipline are of a temporary nature , and generally to be received or rejected , at the discretion of a national clergy , and that neither the dispensing doctrine , as to oaths of allegiance , nor the deposing doctrine , which naturally springs out of it , were ever declared by any general council , as a canon or decree of faith : but the contrary has been maintained by œcumenical councils , —by provincial synods , —by the faculties of theology in the universities of the continent , —and by the rescripts of Popes.—That some individual pontiffs , from the time of Gregory 7 , to Pius 5 , have been prone to assert such a power , is also admitted , —but such opinions have no pretension to infallibility in the estimation of Catholics , nor can it be proved , that in any state , such a proposition was ever , for a moment , seriously entertained by any Catholic body . The contrary , indeed , was sufficiently proved by the history of our own country , when Catholic , and since the reformation , —and by the history of every other state in Europe.—It was not material therefore , to shew that the objectionable canon of the fourth Lateran Council was of spurious origin , which some of the most accredited Catholic writers of the last century admitted , and which has since been maintained by the Catholic Bishop Hay , Father O'Leary , and others of the present day ; at any rate it was an antiquated transaction of the twelfth century , and applicable to no existing state or condition of the present age.— '' We are in a new world , '' ( as it was observed by the latter writer ) , `` raised on the ruins of the former , and if hitherto we could not agree as Christians , it was high time to live together as men . `` —So in the Council of Trent , the last œcumenical council , the abstract doctrines of faith were enjoined on pain of anathema , —but the practical decree of confiscation of the land , to pious uses , on which a duel shall be fought , however laudable the motive , is rejected by every Catholic state as wholly out of the province of legitimate 395 enactment by any council ; and though supported , in that council , by the representatives of sovereign princes , who assisted at the constitution of the decrees , `` no Catholic , '' as was well observed by a Catholic writer , `` could assent to such a verdict . '' With this rapid sketch of objects , which might well fall within the investigation of such a Committee , it
