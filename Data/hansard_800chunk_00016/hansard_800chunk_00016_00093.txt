, one that ought not to be adopted . It would put the officers at the mercy of the 201 men ; for , according as the men determined in that country so must the officers . This Went to affect the first principle of subordination . Another objection was , that if one pan of a regiment volunteered , and the other did not , there would be two distinct services ; the evils of which were obvious . He further objected to the measure upon a constitutional ground . The Militia was a species of military force , that might be said to be independent of the crown : it was a force independent of the Standing Army . Besides it might deprive the service of the talents the ablest of the Militia officers ; and without meaning any thing invidious , it could not be forgotten that it was a different thing to an English country gentleman to go over to Ireland , and to an Irish country gentleman to come over here with his regiment , where he must have come at ail events to attend his parliamentary duties.â€”He like-wise objected to the measure , because it would destroy the means now resorted to of recruiting the regular army . The Militia had of late years been a kind of preparation for the regular service .
