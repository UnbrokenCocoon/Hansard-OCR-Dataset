conviction therefore , can alone account for it . It is however some consolation to me , that if I dissent from them , I agree with many of those exalted characters and eminent writers , to whom they , as well as myself , are in the habit of looking up with respect , and with veneration , and under whose authority I shall be happy to shelter myself , if your lord-ships will pardon the apparent pedantry into which I may be led by so doing . I lay , my Lords , no claim whatever to originality ; not an argument have I ever urged , either in writing or in speaking ; 668 hardly an expression have I made use of , which is not to be met with in the writings of Hoadly and of Locke : in The Liberty of Prophesying , by Jeremy Taylor ; in the `` lrenicum '' of Stillingfleet , and in almost every page of that great man Grotius , particularly in his Votum pro-Pace Ecclesiasticâ and in a more striking manner perhaps than any where , in a very curious and interesting correspondence , which took place between a pious and learned prelate of the Church of England , and the ecclesiastical historian Du Pin , respecting a projected Union of the Gallican Church with the Church of England . The prelate , to whom I allude , is archbishop Wake , whose attachment to the Church of England was never called in question ; and yet , in his last letter to his celebrated correspondent , speaking of the religious tenets of the Catholics , he has the following remarkable expressions ; which , with your lordships permission , I will give you in his own words : `` In Dogmatibus '' ( says this able friend to our ecclesiastical establishment ) , `` prout â te candidâ proponuntur non admodum dissentimus ; in regimine Ecclesiasticâ , `` minus ; in fundamentalibus sive doctrinam , sive disciplinam spectes , vix `` omnino . '' This is , perhaps , going a great way , but be that as it may , your lordships will , lam confident , agree with me in thinking that the candour , the moderation , the conciliatory disposition , shewn by this very eminent Prelate , are widely different from those acrimonious invectives of which we hear a great deal too much in our days from heated advocates on both sides , —but that they are also far better calculated , if not to make proselytes , at least to promote mutual forbearance , love , and esteem ; which , are , on all hands , allowed to be objects of primary importance , as they most unquestionably are virtues peculiarly Christian . Still , however , it may be argued , and to a certain degree fairly argued , that whatever may have been the opinion of archbishop Wake , or of any other divine so many years since , the two Universities , and the present clergy of the established Church , are decidedly hostile to the Petition on your lordships table . That some very respectable members of our two Universities , and some equally respectable among the Parochial Clergy , come under this description , is unquestionably true ; but is it not also true , that there are many , very many exceptions to 669 the truth of this assertion ? Be the assertion , however , admitted , for the sake of argument , and admitted in its fullest extent , still , if it be brought forward as a reason against the claims of the Catholics , it appears to me by no means entitled to the stress that has been laid upon it ; considering the nature of the question , and how very little competent , generally speaking men , of studious , recluse habits are to form a right judgment of great , complicate and comprehensive political topics : I say political topics , my Lords , because the question now before your lordships is not a point of theology ;
