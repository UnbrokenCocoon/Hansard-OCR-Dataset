whether , if sufficient relief could not be afforded , the attempt might not excite expectations which could not be fulfilled , and , by so doing , aggravate instead of alleviating the distresses . The present was not the time for discussing those topics ; he should therefore satisfy himself with declaring upon his own part , and he believed he might upon the part of every member of that House , that it was his desire to afford every practical relief ; but that he should feel it necessary to guard against encouraging any hope which was not likely to be realized . 341 The Petition from Manchester was then read , setting forth , `` That the Petitioners are reduced to the greatest distress , from the extensive depression of the various manufactures occasioning a deficiency of employment , and from the great reduction of wages , which circumstances , added to the high price of provisions , have subjected them to the most unexampled privations ; and that the evils under which they so severely suffer are daily accumulating , and many of their employers , who flattered themselves with enjoying a competence , after many years of toil and industry , now find themselves reduced to complete poverty ; and those who are not yet added to the enormous list of bankrupts find their property daily lessening , and can not , by a continuance in business , in the present state of affairs , promise themselves a better fate ; and that the Petitioners humbly submit , and earnestly hope , that some means will be speedily adopted in order to prevent the impending ruin that threatens the country , as great numbers of artists have been compelled , for want of employment , to quit their native land , and to emigrate to foreign countries , in hopes of ameliorating their condition , and to seek for that encouragement which unfortunately has failed them in this their once happy and prosperous country , by which emigrations the trade of the United Kingdom has been much injured and depressed , and must inevitably , in the course of futurity , end in consequences the most disastrous ; and that the consequence of this situation of affairs is that the great bulk of the Petitioners are reduced to the most dreadful situation , beyond all former precedent and example , great numbers experiencing the total want of employ , and thousands daily suffering the absolute want of the necessaries of life , for themselves , their wives , and helpless offspring ; and that the Petitioners most humbly entreat the House to take into their consideration the distress and situation of the different mechanical branches in general , who are , for want of employment , reduced to want and misery , as the scanty pittance of their earnings is wholly inadequate to procure them the common necessaries of life , the majority of them not being employed more than three days per week ; and that a revocation of the Orders in Council would pave the way to a removal of the Non-intercourse and Non-importation Acts lately passed by the Congress and Senate of the United States of Ame- 342 rica , which have already added , and will no doubt still further tend to add , to the distresses of the Petitioners , and would , in the opinion of the Petitioners , by opening a more extended mart for commerce , in a partial degree be the means of restoring them to a more comfortable state ; and if such measure could be followed up with a general and permanent peace , ( to obtain which desirable end they hope and firmly trust the House will avail itself of every opportunity ) , the whole of the grievances under which the Petitioners , together with many thousand others of his Majesty 's subjects , labour , would then cease , and the Petitioners would be enabled , by the return of trade and commerce , not only to support themselves and families with credit , but with utility to their king and
