a different light , but my conviction is , that public and private credit would have been , for the time at least , destroyed , by the Bank of England , and consequently all private banks , being obliged to discontinue their functions . I do not therefore infer , that we should have been left without a circulating medium ; I have no doubt we should have had one , and that our currency would have been composed of the precious metals almost exclusively ; but we should have been reduced very much to the predicament in which France now is , possessing , it is true , a metallic currency , but destitute of those means of active circulation , growing out of individual and public confidence , which can alone sustain with effect the industry and exertions of a great , commercial , manufacturing , and warlike nation . In such a state of things what would hare happened to my lord King , and his tenant ? Supposing the rent agreed upon previous to the events which led to the passing of the restriction law to have been a rack rent , a rent upon full value , which upon a tenure of such an extent , in justice to the landlord it ought to have been , is it possible to suppose , that such a bargain could have stood , if the banking system of the country had been broken down ? The immediate consequences of such a convulsion , had it been suffered to realize itself , must have been , that lord King , for his own sake , would have lowered his rent , perhaps one half ; what then would have been the situation of his tenant ? he would have found himself cultivating at a reduced rent ; and although , in common with every other member of the community , he must have suffered from the general distress , he would at least have found no difficulty in preserving his lease , by paying his rent in the standard coin of the realm , as coin would then have been the medium in circulation , and consequently the currency receivable at market in payment for produce . Obliged to accept a reduced rent , I can not persuade myself that lord King would have stood in a better situation at this day , than he now does , whatever his tenant might , should he be obliged to submit to this new mode of payment ; by which the noble lord appears to claim the advantage of both systems , of the one which would have destroyed , and of the other which has preserved the Bank ; whilst he expects his tenant to abide by the inconveniences of both ; that is , to pay an amount of rent , with reference to 959 the latter state of things , in a description of currency , only to be found in general circulation in the former . I have been induced thus to dwell upon the principle of lord King 's notice , bet cause in truth the Bill originates in that document . It is impossible to argue the question , as affecting the public , without bringing forward the noble lord 's name , and discussing the demand made as his measure . I have done so , I trust , without personal disrespect . My object has been , without reflecting on the noble lord 's intentions , to argue fairly , whilst I protest strongly , against the course his lordship has pursued in the instance before us . With respect to the enactments of the Bill , they are principally open to objection , as an imperfect remedy to the case to be provided for ; they protect the tenant against summary distress , but they leave him exposed to all the other legal remedies , with which the law arms a creditor against the person and property of his debtor ; but I look upon the Bill as a legislative declaration on the principle of the question , the import
