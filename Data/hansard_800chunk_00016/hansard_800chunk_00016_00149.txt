, that every holder of stock to the amount of 100l . is at this day a loser in money alone to the amount of 250l . ; and now , after so great privations , and after so many years of unremitting attention to the business of the Company and of the public , they find themselves bereft of the hope which sustained them , and consigned to the wearisome office of directing repairs , scrutinizing accounts , and regulating the details of an income that is nearly exhausted in the expence of collecting it ; and that however gloomy this picture may be , the calamitous situation of the creditors of the Company presents not a more cheering aspect ; payments of interest and annuities have been hitherto indeed regularly made , by reason of which circum-stance and of the general confidence in the future prosperity of inland navigation , the debentures of the Company have been sought for with avidity by all those to whom punctuality of payment is of the greatest importance , by unmarried women , by the aged and infirm , the orphan , and the widow ; many of them have entrusted the whole of their little properties on this security , and the eagerness of competition with which payment is sought for as soon as due is the strongest proof of its importance to the holders of the debentures ; and when , therefore , it is considered , that the sums so due for interest and annuities amount to no less than 49,824l . 10s . yearly , and that without the aid of the House , the whole must from this moment cease , it is impossible to think without horror , on the extent of misery that may ensue , and that amidst this scene of calamity the public and the inhabitant-of Dublin alone have profited by the under- 287 taking , the country has a canal of perfect construction amply supplied with water , communicating with the capital and the sea , extending more than 46 miles through tracts of the highest fertility ' , and subject to tolls so low as to be no obstruction to trade or intercourse , and Dublin has for its pipes an abundant supply of the purest water ; and that the petitioners therefore in their distress have this consolation , that their time and labour , though lost to themselves and their families , have not been unprofitable to their country ; and that the petitioners having now no other refuge , humbly beg leave to approach the House with this representation of their case , and to implore from its humanity and wisdom such relief as may seem meet , the petitioners hereby offering to accede to any terms that may be thought reasonable ; if the House shall deem it proper that the northern line leading to Roosky , or any other line of canal should be adopted , and are disposed to defray the expense of it , the Royal Canal Company are willing to devote to it their time , industry , and experience ; but in that case , they presume , they will not be thought unreasonable in hoping that the payment of the annuities secured by their debentures , together with the necessary expenses of the establishment , may be provided for by the public until the funds of the company shall be sufficient for that purpose ; and that if on , the other hand it shall be thought more advisable that the Royal Canal should become public property , and be placed under the management of public officers , the petitioners are ready to accede thereto on such terms as may be agreed on ; and therefore praying , such relief in the premises as to the House shall seem fit .
