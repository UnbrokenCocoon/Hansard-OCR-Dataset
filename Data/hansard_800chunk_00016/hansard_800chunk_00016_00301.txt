be given to Major-Generals the honourable Galbraith Lowry Cole , the honourable William Stewart , John Hamilton , the honourable William Lumley , Charles Baron Alten , Brigadier-General Robert Ballard Long , and the sereral other officers , for their distinguished exertions on the 16th of May last , in the glorious battle at Albuera ; and that lieutenant-general sir William Carr Beresford do signify the same to the honourable William Stewart , John Hamilton , the honourable William Lumley , Charles Baron Alten , Brigadier-General Ballard Long , and the several other officers . That this House both highly approve of and acknowledge the distinguished valour and discipline so conspicuously displayed by the non-commissioned officers and private soldiers of his Majesty 's forces , serving on the 16th of May last , under the immediate command of lieutenant general 530 sir William Carr Beresford , in the signal defeat of the enemy at Albuera , and that the same be signified to them by the commanding officers of the several corps , who are desired to thank them for their gallant and exemplary conduct . '' `` That this House doth highly acknowledge the distinguished valour and discipline displayed by the officers , non-commissioned officers and soldiers of that parl of the Portuguese army which served under the immediate command of lieutenant general sir William Carr Beresford , on the 16th of May last , in the glorious battle at Albuera . '' said , that though he believed there was no instance in which that House expressed its thanks to the allies , unless when they acted under officers of our own , yet the nature of the present contest justified , he thought , a deviation from that rule : and , upon this ground he should move , `` That this House doth highly acknowledge the distinguished valour and intrepidity displayed by the Spanish army under the command of his excellency general Blake , on the 16th of May last , in the glorious battle at Albuera . '' next moved , `` That an humble Address be presented to his royal highness the Prince Regent , that he will be graciously pleased to give directions , that a Monument be erected in the cathedral church of Saint Paul , London , to the memory of major-general Daniel Hoghton , who fell gloriously on the 16th of May last in the battle at Albuera , which terminated in the signal defeat of the enemy 's forces ; and to assure his royal highness , that this House will make good the expense attending the same . '' begged leave to offer a few words with respect to the conduct of that gallant officer , who had acquitted himself worthily in all situations , both as a soldier and as an accomplished gentleman . He had devoted his life to the most active services , and visited every climate in the pursuit of that glory which his profession held up to his view . He had commanded a brigade at Martinique , and on his return from that country exerted himself to get employment under that illustrious general , his friend lord Wellington , whose greatness he had foreboded at an early period . In his last conversation with him , he had stated it as his distinct opinion , that on no account should England relinquish the 531 scene of warfare upon which she was now acting with so much success . It was his fortune to head one of those bands of heroes , who restored the glory of the day at the battle of Albuera , and to perish in the act of encouraging his men . He trusted he should be forgiven for drawing the attention of the House to the merits of the distinguished general , whose memory they were now about to honour , and adding his testimony to that of the country at large , in favour of his virtues and abilities . adverted to the memory of the lamented general Mackenzie . The circumstances of his death , in the battle of Talavera , were precisely similar to those
