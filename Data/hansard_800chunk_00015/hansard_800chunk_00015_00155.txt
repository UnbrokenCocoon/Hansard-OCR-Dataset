it was the intention of the hon . gent . merely to assert the right inherent in a member of Parliament , of making a motion without notice , and imagined it was not his intention to divide the House . in reply , stated such to be his motive . gave notice , that in consequence of the Resolution which had been come to , he should on an early day , submit certain regulations to the House , which that Resolution made necessary . He intended to move , That the Orders of the Day should be called over in regular succession ; and also to move , That no motion of importance should be brought on alter ten o'clock . the chairman of the chamber of commerce and manufacture at Glasgow , said— '' That in Glasgow and the neighbourhood the distress began among the manufacturing body of people , and it has pressed more severely upon them hitherto , than on any other class.—That it began about the month of October or beginning of November last : the cause of it appeared to him to be this . That a set of merchants in London , Liverpool , and Glasgow , conceiving that the markets of South America would consume a vast quantity of our manufactures , entered into a project of very extensive exports to those countries and to the West India islands , chiefly intended for the Spanish colonies ; these expeditions not meeting a ready market , those exporters have not been able to pay the manufacturers , when the bills became due ; these bills were 251 therefore returned upon the manufacturers , which created a great deal of distress.—Many of those houses that were the original causes of the evil , are gone to bankruptcy long ago ; but they have created this evil upon the manufacturers of whom they purchased the goods , that the manufacturers have their property locked up in bankrupts estates ; that part of it will be lost , no doubt , but yet that in the course of nine , twelve or fifteen months , a considerable part of the capital will return to the manufacturers ; but while they are deprived of it , they go on with the greatest difficulty ; many of the weaker have been broken down .
