to his country or his Prince , and an expectation that the enemy might be obliged to evacuate the country , in which case , we would have an opportunity of exercising our benevolence towards the inhabitants . ] Sir , continued he , I do not quote these extracts to the Committee for the purpose of shewing the modesty of the noble lord , a modesty which disdained the boast of annihilating a great army , while he anticipated the probability of forcing it to evacuate the country , and was satisfied to express with moderation , what the event has proved he foresaw with much clear- 756 ness and planned with great skill . It is not , I say , for this purpose , that I quote those extracts to the Committee , but to prove the deserts and the wants of the people in whose behalf I apply ; at the same time it will afford a satisfaction to the people of this country to reflect that While that noble lord and gallant general was occupied in the business of a protracted warfare , while he was Surrounded With the cares and dangers to which his situation exposed him , and suffering the hardships inseparable from the soldier 's life , he was at the same time occupied in contemplating the distresses , and providing for the relief of the afflicted . But if such was the condition of the Portuguese at the period when this letter was written , if such Were their sufferings , and such their merit , need I inform you that they are since increased ? The noble lord might indeed pity , as he did pity them , but he had not such a perfect experience of their military character , or of the zeal with which the Whole population contended against the common enemy . He might indeed pity them then , but he had not such a long and intimate acquaintance with the extent of their distresses . I should think , Sir , that the wish to gratify a person who has no distinguished himself , would form no inconsiderable motive towards the adoption of this measure . I should think also , that the circumstance of its coming recommended from the Prince Regent , would form another motive in its favour . It is natural enough that he , the short period of Whose government has been marked with such brilliant successes , whether we lake into our view the enterprize at Banda , or the achievement in the Baltic , or the conquest of that island , which it has been so long the object of successive governments to reduce , I mean the Isle of France . Whether we consider the action of General Graham at Barrosa , or lastly the evacuation of Portugal by the French , We behold ; as it were , a mass of successes ; and , it is natural that he whose government has been distinguished by such a brilliant character , should wish to mark the period of that government by an act of humanity But it is not merely the feeling of the Prince Regent , it is not merely the feeling of Lord Wellington you will consult but it is their feelings together with those of the whole army . I am sure there is not a member in the House who does not recollect that When the great body of the population was driven Within the British lines , the British officers made a subscription for their relief ; and I am equally sure that the representatives of the people of England will not prove themselves the only persons in different to their situation . If , suppressing the influence of such motives , we look barely to our interest in this question , nothing can be more clear than that it is still imposed upon us as a duty It is important that , in the moment of our elation and triumph , we should hold up a contrast to the world , not only between our own character and that of the
