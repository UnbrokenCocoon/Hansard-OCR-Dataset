reinforcing , in the most efficient and expeditious manner , the French in the Peninsula , and thereby secured the permanency of the contest in that country ; such was the fruit of the first campaign , such was the advantageous proof of our first attempt to contend with our armies against the armies of Buonaparté.—The second campaign commenced under that gallant and most excellent officer sir John Moore , who contrary , and in direct opposition to his own military judgment , and in the teeth of all the remonstrances which he had made to this country upon the danger and folly of pursuing a system founded on such erroneous and dangerous principles , was directed to inarch into Spain , and to undertake once more a contest with Buonaparté 's armies in the Peninsula.—Let it be remembered that this order from the government in England took place when they knew that Buonaparte himself had advanced into Spain , and had reinforced his armies with upwards of 100,000 men : but the system was a favourite one , it was to be pursued under all circumstances , and no example , no reasoning could convince the infatuated minds of those who govern- 402 ed the councils of this country , of the futility and danger of attempting , by a British force , to overwhelm Buonaparté.—The character of England was committed , we were the principals , Spain and Portugal were only auxiliaries in the contest . This gallant man , at the head of his gallant British force , advanced accordingly , aided by the co-operation of sir David Baird , who had landed at Corunna . Here again I shall not stop to enter into the details , it is sufficient to say , that nothing but the extraordinary abilities , the prudence ; judgment , temper , and indefatigable and unwearied exertions of the commander , rescued from utter annihilation , the whole of the army entrusted to his command . What was the result ? after a display of courage and discipline and forbearance under difficulties the most unexampled in the military history of this or any other country , this army effected its retreat to the shores of Corunna , at which point it maintained itself against the desperate attack of the whole French force ; and when , after acquiring a most important and brilliant victory , which was dearly purchased at the expence of the life of the most invaluable and able officer that ever graced the annals of any country , we were enabled to bring back the remnant of the British force in a state so disorganized , so totally annihilated , as to render it necessary to exert the utmost energies of the country to repair its loss—such was the issue of the second attempt to contend with Buonaparté in a military campaign , by the efforts of your armies in the Peninsula.—The next undertakings the next campaign was commenced by the appointment of my gallant and noble friend lord Wellington once more to the command of the forces in Portugal : nothing could be more unpromising , nothing could be more disastrous than the state of Portugal at the time he undertook this hazardous command ; his genius , his promptitude , his zeal , and his extraordinary military talents were necessary in the instant to extricate and relieve his small army from its embarrassments , threatened as it was on the north , on the south , and in the centre.—Here again I should have to detail the gallant exploits of a gallant British army ; but it is in the recollection of every man in the country who has a breast to feel , of a mind to glory , in the valour of his countrymen ; the manner in which he destroyed the army of Soult , in which he arrested the progress of Victor and in 403 which he formed the junction , and infused into the armies of Spain a spirit of emulation and zeal ; no sooner had these events taken place , than the same system was directed to be parsued
