; and he was impressed with the wisdom as well as importance of connecting with the proposed measure every regulation that could tend to mitigate its pressure . He was aware , from the present numbers of the militia , as compared with the intended establishment of 72,000 men for the united kingdom , that a demand upon the counties was not likely for some time to occur , but the interval he thought ought to be employed in their levying , without expence or inconvenience to the counties , the men which were to protect them , at the end of the second year , from the inconveniences of a ballot , for the successful accomplishment of which useful purpose , a new facility would be found in the 217 permanent staff of the local militia , which might be employed in aid of recruiting parties from the militia regiments in raising men in the respective counties . Having stated his views with respect to the means best calculated to keep up the army , lord Castlereagh proceeded to call the attention of the committee to an improvement in the military system of the empire , which he had always deemed of the highest importance , of which he never had for a moment lost sight , and which he had only been induced , when in government , to delay pressing upon the consideration of parliament , from the persuasion that its success might have been risked , bad it been prematurely brought forward , entangled with the many other arduous military measures , which had in latter years occupied the attention of the legislature . When he spoke of the military system of the empire , which he trusted at last had assumed a permanent shape , he did not refer to any particular mode of levying men for military service ; much political contest had taken place on this subject , which in its nature did not appear to him capable of being reduced to any immutable principle , but must vary with the occasion , the state of the country at the time , the difficulty or facility of procuring men , and ; be number required ; but what he considered as more immediately constituting our military system , and on which the repeated judgment of parliament had been pronounced , was—1st , That we should possess a large regular army adequate to all the various extensive demands of this great empire abroad , whose best interests , in time of war , even when viewed on defensive principles , was found to consist in the active annoyance of the enemy : —2dly , That we should possess a still more numerous force of local militia , assembled occasionally for purposes of training , but calculated from its numbers at once to protect the country from even the menace of in vasion : and 3d ly , —A considerable force of regular militia , ready to be called forth at the first commencement of hostilities , ( an advantage which he was persuaded no other description of Force coula possess ) and competent , from their being constantly under arms in time of war , to occupy the garrisons and advanced positions of the empire in the absence of the regular army , and to afford that defensive cover , under which the local militia , should an invasion be attempted , would have to assemble . 218 In looking to this system as a whole , and in contemplating the adequacy of each branch at the present moment to its respective functions , it was impossible not at once to be struck with the imperfection attaching to the latter branch of the public force , namely , the regular militia , whose sphere of service is not co-extensive with the general exigencies of the empire , but is broken , and localized , by those national distinctions which happily , in other respects , have ceased with the union . The inconveniences of this defective organization , perhaps , have been the more slow in impressing themselves on our minds , from the
