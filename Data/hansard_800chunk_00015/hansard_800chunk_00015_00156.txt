business ; a want of confidence on the part of the banks , naturally creates distress among the upper classes of merchants , who are thus deprived of the usual ac- 252 commodation or means of negociation , that therefore persons who are possessed of solid property have not the same means of obtaining credit that they usually have had , and very far from itâ€”this want of confidence in the banks makes them distrustful of every body , and the merchants have felt great inconvenience in consequence : The witness said , he understands that some of the banks at Glasgow and in that neighbourhood , do little business , they will rather accumulate their capital and wait the result of the present situation of things ; this want of confidence creates general distress among very respectable merchants . `` That the intercourse of credit among the merchants themselves was much broken down by means of these circumstances , even where the merchants are solvent . `` That there is considerable injury to the manufacturer , from being obliged to stop his work ; his machinery gets out of order , his workmen get dispersed through the country , and he can not collect them again , but at considerable trouble and expence ; and when it is understood that his business is stopped , he loses his custom , and when he begins again , it is almost the same as beginning a new business ; it is therefore extremely important that the manufacturer should go on , though on a limited scale . `` That in his opinion the demand would in a great measure come round to them again ; that the home trade and some other markets are still open to them ; that he has always seen in his experience of thirty years , that a glut in a market is followed by a brisk demand ; for no person will supply the markets or adventure at all when they are overstocked , hence the market becomes exhausted , and of course a very good demand arises afterwards . The markets of South America and the West India islands are overstocked at present , but they will naturally come round , and the home trade always takes off a certain quantity , so that he had no doubt in six or twelve months this increased demand will do more than take off what is on hand now , or what will be manufactured in the mean time , which will be a very limited quantity indeed . `` That if there was no particular glut in the market , from the time of shipping the goods till the payment could be commanded in this country , he should conceive would be twelve or fifteen months ; 253 it may in some instances be sooner , but , generally speaking , he should conceive about that time . In some instances payments have been much quicker , perhaps by the return of the same ship ; and he mentioned that there have even been instances of ships returning within four or five months . `` The usual date of bills given by the merchant to the manufacturer is six or nine months , but in some cases it may be extended to twelve months ; in cases where the goods are sold by an agent in London , that agent interposes his credit , and gives an accommodation to the manufacturer sooner , if he requires it , taking his chance of payment from the merchant . `` That the distresses were immediately and in the first instance occasioned by the want of payment for those that were vended ; but at the same time the want of a market is certainly a part of the cause . The markets of South America having been for a time overstocked , there is no great demand at present ; and even though there were a demand in the present situation of things , with the want of confidence and the want of credit , it would be difficult for the manufacturers to know to whom to
