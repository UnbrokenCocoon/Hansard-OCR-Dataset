bullion from coming to the mint , whilst that cause subsists , ( and coining will not remove it ) the new coin will be melted into bullion again ; and again coined ; and so round in a circle , as long as a premium to the import of bullion into the mint is continued . And after all this expence , and all the expectation raised from it , no new coin will be seen . The same cause that created a scarcity before , will carry all that away , and nothing will be left but the gains that had been made at the mint . '' To which he might have added , and the profits of the fraudulent melter . This is put so clearly , that I should waste the time of the Committee if I were to add any thing to shew how utterly useless it would be to the public to compel the Bank to pay in specie till bullion can be had at a reasonable rate ; and , I trust , I have shewn how entirely it is out of the power of that Company to procure it even at a greatly advanced price , under present circumstances : while the consequences to them , and through them to the public , would be ruinous . On any means of providing bullion by the Bank , the Report before us is perfectly silent ; but , in the exposition of it by my hon . friend , he suggests as an expedient to avoid some of 893 the inconveniences of recurring to payments in specie , that the whole of the 6,000,000l . advanced in consideration of the deposits of public money , if necessary , might be repaid to them ; to which an answer might be furnished from the evidence given by Mr. Henry Thornton to the Secret Committee of Lords in 1797 ; who said , `` The circumstance of government paying oft ' their debt to the Bank , which has been supposed in the question put to me , would evidently , as I apprehend , make no difference in any part of the case which I have described . The debt which Government would pay to the Bank would be paid by a loan from the public , and would be raised immediately from the banking or mercantile world . I apprehend that the very negotiation of a loan in times of great difficulty and distress , since it occasions the payment of large instalments on particular days , would be the cause of peculiar apprehensions antecedently to those clays , and of very eager endeavours of some bankers to provide Bank-notes for the payment of whatever might be their expected share of the instalments ; which share they would not know distinctly beforehand , since they are not informed of the proportions of the loan which each customer may have . '' My fear of exhausting the patience of the Committee has induced me to limit very much the references to the evidence given to the former one , but I hope many of those to whom I now address myself have read the whole : I have done so with the closest attention , and I can most safely say , that I have met with nothing in any part of it which at all countenances the measure recommended by the Report , except in the examination of sir Francis Baring , and the continental merchant ; the former of whom is decidedly against a compulsory measure with the Bank , and the latter plainly and explicitly says , that recurring to payments in specie would be of little use , unless we allowed that to be exported , in direct contradiction to laws which have been in force for several centuries ; the expediency of enforcing the provisions of which may have been doubtful , and I have thought it so till this time ; but if no such laws had been in existence now , I should have been inclined to recommend the enactment of an effectual one , as
