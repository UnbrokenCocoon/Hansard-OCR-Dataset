am moving for the number of Informations Ex Officio , and I will ask him this ; if they have increased in number within these last three years , and not only in number but in proportion too , to other modes of prosecution , will he say that no inference is to be drawn from that ? If he does , will he tell me from what possible facts inferences of this nature are to be drawn ? Well , but , says another learned lord ( Redesdale ) after all the Attorney General is responsible , and solely responsible , for the exercise of this duty . I must say , by the bye , I was glad to hear this avowal , though I do not see how it made for the learned lord 's argument , or justified his vote against inquiry ; however I was glad to hear it , for the habit , apparently generous , but really artful and pernicious , of every man in office starting up to share the responsibility of a colleague in an act in which he is the only official agent ; this habit , I say , or rather this trick , this cant , this jargon , has a tendency to fritter away all responsibility whatever , and to render that great security of our liberties a mere dead letter in the constitution.—On this responsibility the learned lord on the woolsack states that he , when Attorney General , did many things which he justly says I should disapprove , but which he 171 assures the House , were more severe than any now resorted to by his successor ; and he alludes more particularly to his punishing printers and publishers as severely , or at least as uniformly as authors . I am certainly not disposed to compliment that learned lord , on that part of his political life , and still less to speak with respect of those times and those proceedings , but yet this I must say , that the times were peculiar , that many independent and good men thought they justified a deviation from common rules , and as far as the subject now before us is affected , parliament itself had by inquiries , committees , legislative acts , and other proceedings , ( whether wisely or not , is not now the question ) expressed its opinion that offences of this nature had increased , and that extraordinary vigilance and even severity should be resorted to . Parliament then was not likely to notice any increase of prosecutions which it had itself encouraged and sanctioned . The same causes which had Jed to the increased number of prosecutions , did lead to alarms in parliament , to committees , to laws , and to other proceedings . Parliament in its own conduct recognized causes which might well occasion an additional number of prosecutions , but that is not the case now , nor is it a reason why with the unexplained fact that Ex Officio Informations are now increased in the proportion of 8 to 1 , in the course of three years , we should take no step , and should not even inquire whether this phœnomenon proceeds from an increase of offences which might require additional laws to put them down , or an abuse of authority which might call for some censure to punish it , or some regulation to restrain it in future . I do indeed differ with the noble and learned lord ; I am not for punishing author , printer , and publisher of a libel . The law it seems to me should take no cognizance of the latter but for the purpose of coming at the former . A contrary system acts as a system of terror on printers and booksellers , and may defraud the public of works not only innocent but useful , by deterring the intermediate agents from printing and publishing a book which their ignorance , or their timidity , may lead them erroneously to deem libellous . I did not disapprove of the principle
