upon record , the points or principles of law , which shall form , in future , the grounds of each of its judicial decisions ? '' opposed the motion , on the ground that it was not applicable to the present stage of the proceeding , the object for consideration being simply what means should be adopted to do that which had evidently become necessary , namely , to expedite the judicial business of the House . When the committee made their report , it would then be for the House to determine finally what measures should be adopted . The motion was negatived . rose , agreeably to notice , to move for leave to bring in a Bill for rendering more effectual the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade . He moved , that the Resolution of the House of the 10th of June 1806 , be read ; and the same was read as follows : `` Resolved , 234 That this House , conceiving the African Slave Trade to be contrary to the principles of justice , humanity , and sound policy , will , with all practicable expedition , proceed to take effectual measures for abolishing the said trade , in such manner , and at such period , as may be deemed advisable . '' He also moved , That the Resolution of the House , of the 15th of June , in the last session of parliament , respecting the Slave Trade , be read : And the same was read , as follows : `` Resolved , nem . con .

He might appeal for the truth of this statement , to the evidence on the table of the House , and to various other sources of information which had come to his hands , and which were also known to many other members of the House , and which could leave no doubt whatever that a considerable traffic was still carried on in the trade in question , by subjects of this country , resident in our colonies . It would be better for him , however , instead of referring to the evidence generally , to notice one or two instances 235 which had come to his own knowledge , and which must satisfy any man , that the trade was persisted in , not only in defiance of the acts of the 46th and 47th of the king , but even in defiance of the last resolution of the House . In doing so , he should have a disagreeable
