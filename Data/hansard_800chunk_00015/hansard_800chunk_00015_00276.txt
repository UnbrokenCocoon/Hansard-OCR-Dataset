These parties did them no honour . Their time was too much occupied with them ; and he deprecated any dispute as to the trivial matter who was to nominate a Committee , which the House would take care was properly named . said , the hon . gent , was right in thinking that these party tricks did them no credit . He bowed to the chair ; but having expressed at some length his dissent to the proposition of the right hon . baronet , it was only through mistake that he deemed it unnecessary to say `` No , '' as early on putting the question as he ought to have done . He concluded by giving a direct negative to the motion . was for the appointment of the Committee as early as possible , as if it was put off , the opportunity for this important investigation would come too late to be of service to the country . put it to the feeling of the House , if it was not the general custom , when government were willing to take the necessary steps , that the measure should be left in their hands .
