Stores , he did not believe that the previous practice of government had been such as to in-duce any of those individuals to imagine , that they had a claim on that fund 723 to a greater extent than that which remained after the passing of the act . And as to the Excise Officers , of whom his hon . friend said , that the act of last session had deprived them of expectant rights vested in them by two former acts , the fact was , that in some respects the claims were increased by the last act ; for it was provided by it that , after a certain age , not three fourths merely , but the whole of his salary should be allowed to an officer . It was Obvious also that the number , who had the slightest shadow of justice for complaint , must be confined to those who entered as clerks in that department of the public service during the short period , a twelvemonth , between the passing of the first of the acts alluded to by his honourable friend , and the passing of the act founded on the Report of the Finance Committee .
