besides the regular army , a militia , which , by its discipline and valour , had already taken 5,000 French prisoners . What might not this country hope from such an effort ? Might it not encourage the nations of the North ? Might it not encourage—might it not animate—the most insignificant to some bold attempt , and rouse Europe in general to choose the happy moment , and avail itself of the noble lesson ? Portugal , as he had collected from undoubted quarters , had put on foot in the last campaign , in military array , a greater number than was ever brought into action by any of the old military governments . The proof of this fact might have the most powerful influence upon the tyrant of Europe ; and other countries might be stimulated to a similar enterprize , when they found that Portugal succeeded even beyond the most sanguine expectations that could have been formed of her . rose and said : Sir , It , is quite impossible I can allow this question to be put without offering a few observa- 399 tions to the House , not with a view of taking its sense upon the propriety of this grant of money ; not with a view of resisting its issue , but in order to discharge my mind of those feelings with which it is impressed by the perseverance , on the part of those in whose hands the government of this country is placed , in a system towards Spain and Portugal , which I conceive to be not only of no avail to their cause , but highly injurious and detrimental to the best interests of this country.—At the dawn of this animated contest in Spain , in 1808 , no man could more strongly , more warmly participate in the general and universal feeling towards that country than I did ; it was a feeling congenial to the heart and mind of every Englishman ; it was a burst of indignation against the most outrageous and unexampled oppression on the part of the French emperor ; it was a natural sympathy ; it was aiding the weak against the strong ; it was a free country , and a free people animated in the support of the freedom , the independence , the integrity of the Spanish empire : what Englishman could resist such a call as this ? what Englishman could withhold his whole , his warmest support in such a cause ? it was under such universal and general feelings , that the ministers of that day , in whom the present Chancellor of the Exchequer is included , undertook the support of the Spanish patriots . Now , Sir , let us review the principles upon which that support was to be given on their part ; let us look back to the declaration of his Majesty 's ministers at the time , and we shall find that it was to be an alliance formed on the principles of general and zealous support to the Spanish nation , in a manner most conducive to their welfare and advantage , but at the same time least injurious to British interests.—These were the principles upon which this alliance was to be formed ; principles which coincided with the sentiments of the public at large , and in which the government was universally supported.—Let us now see upon what system these principles have been maintained ; let us see how far the ministers have effected the two objects of giving every support to the Spanish patriots , in a manner most conducive to their interests , and in what manner they have kept sight of the interests and security of England . It is upon this head that I condemn their conduct ; it is upon this system which I have to argue , and upon which I trust I shall shew , before I sit down , that 400 they have betrayed not only their allies , but that unexampled confidence which was reposed in them . It will be impossible for me to bring before
