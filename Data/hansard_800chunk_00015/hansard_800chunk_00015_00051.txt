, however , was the tone of the right hon . gent . ( Mr. Yorke ) unsubdued , and he bounced about with as much energy and as much effect as he has done to night . And it was of this government that the noble lord had said that Mr. Pitt had not at that period distinguished it with peculiar marks of his confidence . Confidence ! really the noble lord has such an inverted mode of disguising things by words , that one would suppose the greatest possible favour which could be conferred on the noble lord would he actually kicking him out of office [ a laugh . ] The noble lord had argued that if the government had not acted as it then did , they would have been the most miserable creatures ; but so were they charged by Mr. Pitt to be . He did not mince his meaning . He thought them very miserable men ; men miserably deficient in the conduct of the affairs of this country , and men who consequently ought to be removed from the conduct of them . This was Mr. Pitt 's opinion , and he acted upon it , for he left no effort untried till he succeeded in driving them from the helm.â€”But much has been said upon the presumed competency of the King at the time alluded to in the present charge against the lord chancellor , to transact business as well as any individual ; on the contrary , he would undertake to say , that any act of any individual under such circumstances would have been set aside . He had been accused by the right hon . gent . of not doing his duty , in suffering this charge to have lain seven years dormant without bringing it forward . But he would beg the House to recollect , that when lord Eldon told the other House , in 1804 , that the King was well , Dr. Simmons was at that moment in attendance on the royal person . The House , however , did not know it , nor had he the least idea of it . The right hon . gent . had adverted to his conduct on various committees . He had been on several committees with that right hon . gent . and generally found an opponent in him . It was asked , why he did not cross-examine the physicians before the committee ; his answer was , why did not the noble lord and the right hon . gent . suffer him to do so . Why , when he attempted it , was he out voted ? He wished to do it , and tried to do it . Let him now only have an opportunity of cross-examining the physicians before the House or before a committee , and he would pledge himself to make out satisfactorily 85 the whole of his charge . The noble lord seemed to lay great stress on the evidence of Dr. Heberden before that House . He did not attach so much to it , for it was in some places rather contradictory , and no doctor could pronounce exactly upon every case . But if any private gentleman had been under such circumstances as his Majesty was in 1804 , and that private gentleman had made his will , with doctors Simmons and Willis attending him at the time , that will would assuredly beset aside ; aye , and even by the same lord chancellor , baron Eldon , if it were brought before him . Dr. Heberden then , it appeared , told the ministers they must be cautious how they touched on delicate points . The noble lord had indeed said , that the country was at that time in danger of invasion , and , therefore , it was necessary that his Majesty 's ministers should not suffer the affairs of the stale to remain at a stand . It appeared the King was well enough to talk of his private affairs , of the duke of York 's Estate Bill
