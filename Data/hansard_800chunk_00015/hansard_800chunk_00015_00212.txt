, the case of the year 1793 was as dissimilar from the present as could be in almost every respect . Then there was a fall , not on one commodity ; but on every one . There was a rise in the value of money , and a fall on every other commodity whatever . It equally affected every person too , and was of short duration . There was then no want of market , there was no glut or stagnation of trade ; but there was a want of individual confidence . Then there was a diminution of the circulating medium . Was that so now ? Then the issues by the Bank of England were 14 millions , now they exceeded 23 millions . He wished gentlemen to consider the essential difference in the state of things 339 then and at the present moment . Now there was a demand in the country for good paper ; and the Rank of England , so far from confining its discounts , has , in consequence of the want of good bills to discount , been purchasing largely of government securities . He wished the present Report had been more explicit . The House , he observed , would recollect that in the year 1793 , several gentlemen of the first character , members of that House , had been examined before the Committee , and stated that houses of known respectability could not , at that period , get money on good bills . At that time not one considerable house failed . He remembered well that there was hardly one house of those which stopped payment which did not afterwards pay in full , possessing more than the amount of all the claims made on the concern . The witnesses examined even had stated the manufacturers who had capitals to be the persons who felt the greatest distress . Under all the circumstances , the question then was , if the remedy resorted to in 1793 ought to be resorted to when the situation of things was different ? The present Report , on the contrary , now went , as it were , to countenance the idea that there were manufacturers at present who had no capital at all . It staled , that such merchants could not obtain credit ; as if it was to be considered a strange thing that there should be a want of credit where a merchant was not solvent . This was the difference between the Report in 1793 , and that now before the House . He would not on this occasion anticipate what might be said on the subjectâ€”but he hoped that on some other occasion the House would not fail to discuss and inquire into this evil . The commercial and manufacturing classes were then straitened for want of a circulating medium ; but were they so in this instance ? At the present moment there was no deficiency of circulating medium , and if securities were unexceptionable they would not now he refused . There was not at present any want of facilities , but want of confidence . Let it be considered , that in the present state of matters the Bank of England , or any persons who advanced money , were partners in every speculation , to the extent of five per cent , without risk . Under these circumstances could it be surprising that there should be great readiness to give credit , and that it should be too greatly extended ? In his opinion the great evil arose from too great 340 a facility of procuring credit . And here , without any thing injurious or offensive to the Very respectable individuals concerned , he could not help adverting to the sad catastrophe which had recently occurred in the city ( the death of Mr. Goldsmid ) to one of the contractors for the late loan , as a consequence of the facility of speculations to a large amount , beyond the means of the parties , and an illustration of his argument . Did gentlemen not see that the
