He ( lord Holland ) approved as much , perhaps , more than any man of this principle ; he thought till this instance that he pushed it to the extreme , bat then it must be impartially applied ; and when he found that in other instances , where the authors were known , the publishers , nay the printers , were selected by preference for prosecution and punishment , he could not help thinking some other motive , and not the principle so exclusively applied to the Morning Post , induced the Attorney General to adopt this conduct . If it was on the principle , it would have applied to all ; if it was accident , it at least was singular that it fell on a newspaper so professedly devoted to ministers . He would ask in Latin words , which he recollected somewhere , though he knew not where , si justitœ causâ cur non in omnes ? si misericordiœ cur in hunc ? Was it or was it not the Protestant Letters which atoned in the Attorney General 's eyes for the crime of exciting our army to mutiny , by false reports and base and unfounded calumnies on the government ? When he perceived a vigilance , that in three years discovered near four times the number of heinous offences that his predecessors had detected in twice the time ; when he looked at his rigour on one hand , and the solitary instance of his mercy on the other , it would not be charity , it would be blindness , not to suspect ; it would not be candour , it would be hypocrisy , not to say that the Attorney General had exercised these powers for the purposes of influence , instead of confining them to the legitimate cases of necessity , for which 143 alone they were entrusted to him . He wished the House to consider what was the effect of such Information , even where no sentence was passed , no verdict obtained , no trial instituted ; the bare operation of an Attorney General so accusing a man , put him at once to an ex-pence of from 60l . to 200l . without the possibility of being indemnified . It was to all intents and purposes a fine of that sum , at the discretion of the Attorney General to inflict as often as he chose , on `` very writer , proprietor , editor , or printer of a public newspaper.—Such a power might be right , might be necessary , but surely it was one , in the exercise of which the officer entrusted with it should be narrowly watched , according to every dictate of public prudence , and every maxim of our jealous constitution . He would not deny that other extraneous circumstances connected with the administration of justice , rendered this jealousy with respect to Ex Officio Informations more necessary in his mind , than at other periods.—He felt indeed that the power of imprisoning criminals in distant and different jails , was a power which resided in the courts of this kingdom , and which , it was proper on various considerations of policy , of safety , and in some cases of humanity too , should reside in the court which passed sentence upon them ; he was far from accusing ( God forbid he should ) the present judges , of having intentionally abused that power , but he did humbly think , that in effect the imprisonment of individuals convicted of the same libel in distant and different jails had operated as a severe and as an unequal aggravation of punishment , and he could not but think that it was not ( to use a law phrase again ) eo intuitu that the judges were entrusted with it . Another point of a yet more delicate nature was Special Juries : on this much irritation , much suspicion , prevailed , he knew not whether it was founded , he was sure that , well or ill founded , it ought to be discussed and
