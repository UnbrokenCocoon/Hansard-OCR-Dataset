year of 20,232l . a saving which he thought highly creditable to the victualling board . He now came to the second head of the Ordinaries , namely , the half-pay military pensions , & c. The estimate for the half-pay of the present year was 270,000l . ; last year it had been 250,000l . There was therefore an augmentation of 20,000l . owing to a greater number of officers being unemployed at the present period . In the estimate of military pensions , & c. there was an excess over the similar estimate of last year , amounting to 4,422l . arising from a great number of small items , chiefly pensions granted to wounded officers , to the widows and children of officers , & c.â€”The third and last head of the Ordinaries was the superannuations of pensions to the civil officers of the navy . In the estimate for the present year would be found a vast number of items not included in the estimates of former years , and comprehending a large proportion of those charges which had hitherto been defrayed out of the fund arising from the sale of old stores . The apparent excess was necessarily considerable . The estimate of 1810 had been 23,683l . the present estimate was 42,822l . ; so that there was an increase of 19,139l . So much for the Ordinary Estimates of the navy , which altogether amounted to 1,578,413l . He would now proceed to the Extraordinaries , consisting of the expences in the King 's yards , of the repairing and building of ships in merchants ' yards , and of various works in different yards . By a difference of arrangement in the form of the estimate it would be found , that in the charge for the King 's yards , although the items were of the same description as those in the estimates of last year , there was a decrease of 53,660l . notwithstanding in the item of Milford there was an excess of 5,418l . In the estimates , how-ever , of building and repairing in merchants ' yards , and of works in the dock yards , there was a very great increase , owing to the necessity of completing several ships which had for some time been seasoning ; to the works which were carrying on at Sheerness ; and to the propos- 375 ed wet dock at Malta , which last item alone was 10,000l . The increase in these estimates of building and repairing in merchants ' yards , and of works in the dock-yards , was 208,193l . The total of the extraordinaries of the navy amounted , for the present year , to 2,046,200l . In 1810 , the total had been 1,841,000/ . ; the increase , therefore , was 205,200l . The next Estimate to which he should direct the attention of the Committee , was that for victualling the army at outports and foreign stations . That estimate for last year had been 854,314l . ; for the present year , it was 1,113,894l . There was an increase , therefore , of 259,580l . which was attributable to the large force employed abroad . The only remaining subject of consideration was the . Transport Service . The estimate of the present year for this service very much exceeded that of 1810 . This excess arose from two causes : the first , the great augmentation of prisoners of war , and the necessity of providing proper means for their security and maintenance ; the second , the increase which bad taken place in the salaries and contingencies of the Transport office . The Estimates for the present year were as follow : for Transports , 2,752,662l . ; for Sick and Wounded , 352,462l . ; for Prisoners of War , 924,336l . ; and for Salaries , Stationary , & c . 33,538l . ; making a total of 4,062,999l . Having thus gone through the whole of the Estimates , he should sit down , expressing his readiness to explain any points that might be considered as
