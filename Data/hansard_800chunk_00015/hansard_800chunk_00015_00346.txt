In a struggle such as that , in which they were now engaged with a formidable enemy , it was matter of no small encouragement to know , that in the event of any of those critical emergencies which the casualties of war must so often and so unexpectedly bring , to pass ; it was no small encouragement to be able to rest satisfied , that in such a moment this country might securely rely upon those great energies in her military character , to be found at all times as well in the skill , devotion , and genius of her generals , as in the unconquerable valour and discipline of her armies . In addition to what he felt , in common with every one , upon this subject , he had also great personal satisfaction in knowing , that the honours of that most brilliant achievement devolved upon his friend general Graham , than whom never did man enter his profession with nobler zeal for the service . The peculiar circumstances under which he entered on it , though they debarred him from looking forward to the honours opened to those who proceeded through the more regular gradations , yet never had the slightest effect in damping his military ardour . That ardour burned in his bosom with as bright and as pure a flame when he was but colonel Graham , and expected to die colonel Graham , as it did now , when , happily for the destinies of England , his great military genius had been advanced to a more suitable , because a more elevated and extended sphere of 547 action ; amongst the many , he might almost say , the innumerable advantages which the army had derived from the uniform diligence and anxious care for their best interests evinced by his royal highness the late Commander in Chief , there were few for which the country had more reason to be grateful than that act by which his Royal Highness succeeded in obviating the difficulties which stood in the way of general Graham 's promotion .

In the abundant stores of British glory he could find nothing of the kind to equal it . said , that all parts of the House agreed in attributing no small part of the causes which led to the general successes of our arms to the wise regulations of the late Commander in Chief : if that were so , and he had no doubt that it was , he hoped that his Royal Highness would at last be done justice to ; he hoped he should soon hear of his being restored to the high situation he filled so well , and that he would again , and shartly too , be enabled to serve the army and the
