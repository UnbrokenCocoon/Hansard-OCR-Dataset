object of that night 's debate . said , he should not feel it necessary to trouble the committee at any length upon the financial part of the estimatesâ€”the outline of the intended services had been explained with great clearness by the noble lord ( Palmerstone ) , and the votes proposed seemed to be regulated with all due attention to economy , consistent with the efficiency of the army upon its present high scale , in point of numbers . The only estimate to which he was particularly desirous of alluding , was that which went to reduce the annual training of the local militia from 21 to 11-days . The share to be had in creating this force , the interest he personally felt in its well-being , and the conviction impressed on his mind , that the permanent security of the empire rested on its improvemen 214 and conservation , made him very reluctantly acquiesce in any retrenchment which might have a tendency to impair the discipline , and consequently the efficiency of this great system of national defence ; but whilst he acknowledged his repugnance to the proposed change in a military point of view , he was ready to admit that there were grave considerations which operated the other way , arising from a due attention to public expence , and the general convenience of the men serving . In this state of things , as a friend of the measure , he thought it best to submit to the change , as an experiment . The local militia bad hitherto found in the country nothing but friends . He thought it would be prudent in its advocates not to attempt to strain a string which so happily had been wound up to its present pitch . If we had been obliged to relax in the number of training days , which originally appeared to him necessary , he had the consolation to observe the institution flourish in a degree far beyond his hopes , from the universal zeal and spirit with which the nation had carried it into execution . All distinctions of party had been lost in the common effort ; to that patriotic spirit he was willing to trust for preserving and improving this force , even under the proposed modifications , satisfied that there was but one common feeling in parliament , and throughout the country , that the efficiency of this institution must be upheld , and that so long as it was effectually sustained , the security of the British empire was placed beyond the reach of danger . then proceeded to notice the concluding part of the secretary at war 's speech , which related to the recruiting of the army . It was that branch of the subject on which he had come down , desirous of calling for that information which the noble lord had so fully imparted to the House . To those conversant with army details , it must have been obvious , without reference to returns , that carrying on operations abroad on the scale we now did , the waste of the army , even from the common casualties incident to troops in the field , must very considerably exceed the resources of ordinary recruiting . In looking to what it might be necessary to do , he was ready to acquiesce in the principle laid down by the noble lord , that adverting to the magnitude of the force which the country now happily possessed , the object to be aimed at was rather to keep 215 up , than augment the present numbers of the army . It having fallen to his lot officially to propose to parliament all the onerous measures which had taken place since the year 1805 , for levying men , it was gratifying to him to find , that these efforts had achieved the great object to which they were progressively directed ; that the zeal and perseverance of the nation , in cheerfully submitting to these burthens , was rewarded by the powerful army which they now possessed , unexampled before in any period
