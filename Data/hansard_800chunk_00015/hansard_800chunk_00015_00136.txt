years . He was aware , that a protracted absence from the vicinity of their own counties , might prove inconvenient both to the concerns of the regiment and of the officers ; but when it was considered that the rotation of service in Ireland would , to the English militia , come round only once in eight years , supposing the whole period to be one of uninterrupted war , and that leaves of absence are , at all times , liberally granted to militia officers , whose private affairs require this indulgence , be could not but feel sanguine , that the gentlemen interested would , for so great an object , cheerfully submit to this additional sacrifice . 220 It was not merely to the military advantages of the measure that he looked with an anxious solicitude for its accomplishment . He was of opinion , that its moral effects upon the empire would operate not less beneficially ; he could assure the committee that his desire to see it accomplished , did not spring from the smallest distrust of the Irish militia soldier in his own country . It was not the language of management , but of sincerity , when he declared , that his confidence in them was as unbounded as in any other portion of the militia army . He had seen them tried severely in the worst of times—such times as he trusted would never again recur , and had always found them do their duty with exemplary zeal and fidelity . It was from a wish to cultivate intercourse , and to abolish every trace of separation between the component parts of the same empire , that he pressed the measure—he was desirous that the gentlemen of England , serving in the militia , should , by observation , inform themselves of the actual state of Ireland , unfortunately too little known , and too often misrepresented—that they should witness on the spot the generous and endearing qualities which distinguished the national character of Ireland , and which the pestilent labours of the disaffected had not been able to extinguish . He was also anxious that the Irish militia should have an opportunity of mixing with their fellow-subjects on this side of the channel ; for , proud as he felt of the essential qualities of his countrymen , he was persuaded they would derive advantage from passing in the service of their country , into Great Britain , and there witnessing the happy state of society in which a people lived , who had long subjected themselves to industrious and moral habits , who looked up to the magistrate as their best protector , and to the law , which had made them what they are , for every future blessing—such an intercourse could not fail to improve both , to unite them in sentiments of common interest , and to cement in the feelings of the people , the union which had for ever bound their fates together . He was himself old enough to remember when the different provinces in Ireland were so estranged from each other in habits , that the inhabitants of the north and of the south felt it a less separation from their homes to cross the Atlantic , than to transfer their residence and industry to the other extremity of the island . Time had done 221 something to remove this , but the institution of the militia had done more—the constant intercourse , the intermarriages , the knowledge derived of the entire island by the interchange of the regiments between county and county , since the year 1793 , had nearly obliterated these prejudices , and made the inhabitants of Ireland one people—might not similar effects be hoped for in the empire from similar causes , and to procure such happy results , what efforts ought we not to make ? To render them effectual nothing is wanting but a further exertion , under the sanction of the legislature , of that patriotic devotion which the militia officers have never failed to display , whenever they saw and were convinced that the
