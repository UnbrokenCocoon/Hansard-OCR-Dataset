forbid ! But he did mean to deprecate all passion and irritation in the punishment ; he did mean to recommend an uncommon degree of temper , forbearance , or , if they would have it so , connivance , in the execution of the laws against state libel , for it was 147 his conscientious conviction , that the prosecution and punishment of all that the law could construe into libel , would have the effect of degrading the press , and especially the periodical press ; of deterring men of character and talent from becoming authors , and of throwing that powerful engine exclusively into the hands of the servile sycophants of power , or of needy adventurers of desperate fortunes , who having nothing to lose could only raise themselves to importance by slander , calumny , and falsehood . He ridiculed the notion that before the French revolution those liberties might be allowed with advantage which would be pernicious now , under circumstances so different from those which accompanied that event , and at the distance of ten or fifteen years . It was like the character in a popular farce who could make fine speeches , do grand things , and conduct himself with wisdom , propriety , and justice , before he had the measles , but seemed to think that having had that disorder fully accounted for and excused all his subsequent folly and incapacity . Among ail the political crimes of our enemy , none in his opinion was more disgusting than his tyrannical restraint on the press . Englishmen might indeed , in a narrow view , feel some exultation , though not of a very philosophical nature , at the adoption of such measures by their enemy—for these shackles on liberty always proved restraints on the talents and exertions of the country in which they were imposed and endured ; but if Buonaparté hated the liberty of the press in France , why , he would ask , should that which was his natural enemy elsewhere be branded as his friend in this country ? Did the nature of things change from one side of the Channel or the other ? Or was it to be supposed that even the grossest licentiousness of the press , licentiousness which would be hurtful to society , disgraceful to civilization , and cruel to individuals , would in this country , among a people so attached to their language and their habits , and justly inspired with such strong national pride , reconcile them to a foreign invader , make them prefer Frenchmen to Englishmen , and lead them to surrender their rights and their constitution to the tyranny of a foreign usurper . It was talking like children to hold such language and to express such preposterous apprehensions . Let us not load even wickedness itself , with imputations to which it is not in truth exposed . The 148 abuse of the press , libel , slander , and calumny , might be and had been productive of great injury to mankind ; but never had there been an example of its reconciling a great and powerful nation to its enemies , of its paving the way to foreign dominion and usurpation . The antient republics , in which the most disgusting licence of speech was permitted , might , in the judgment of many men , have constituted unhappy societies , the indulgence of satire and slander led to ingratitude , to persecution , to injustice ; but of all nations , those very states which had most extravagantly indulged in such excesses , and had most bitterly suffered for so doing , were those which had made the grandest efforts in proportion to their natural resources against foreign invasion and encroachments . In the French revolution itself , whatever the horrors of it might be , and whatever share the disgusting and defamatory libels with which the press then teemed , might have had in producing them , it would be untrue and therefore unjust even to them , to say that they palsied the efforts of the country
