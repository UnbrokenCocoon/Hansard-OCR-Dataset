It may be said that the scarcity of 1800 and 1801 , was the cause of the high price of corn during the last four years , and not a fall in the real value of gold . But in answer to such a reason I would say , though these were unquestionably very scarce years , some of the following years were very abundant ; and besides , it must be remembered , that the ports have been open to the importation of grain as completely as if there existed no law to prevent it . But there is one circumstance which I think will fully settle every doubt upon the question , which is this ; in the year 1740 , which was a year of extraordinary scarcity , the quarter of the best wheat did not ever rise higher than 2l . 10s . 8d . ; in 1807 , when the market was overstocked with grain , and the prices fell very low , 2l . 7s . was the lowest price of the quarter of wheat in London . This fact alone is sufficient to shew that the late advance in prices is not owing to scarce seasons.—If we examine the state of prices in other 1794 2 11 8 29 ) 66 9 10 Average £2 5 10 1795 3 14 2 1796 3 17 1 1797 2 13 1 1798 2 10 3 1799 3 7 6 1800 5 13 7 1801 5 18 3 1802 3 7 5 1803 2 16 6 1804 3 0 1 1805 4 7 10 1806 3 19 0 1807 3 13 3 1808 3 19 0 52 17 0 Deducting 2½ per cent . on the prices of the last 9 years , in consequence of gold being at 4l . per ounce 0 18 4½ 14 ) 51 18 8 Average 3 14 2¼ The prices from 1764 to 1770 both inclusive are taken from Smith 's Corn Tracts , p. 128 .

The accounts , in the Appendix to the Report of the Bullion Committee , of the prices of the corn in Spain , establish these facts ; that from 1765 to 1794 both inclusive , the average price of the fanega of wheat was 35 reals vellon , and from 1795 to 1804 , both inclusive , 55 reals vellon . A variation proving that the real value of silver has fallen in the proportion of 11 to 7 or 57 per cent . The right hon . gent. , the Treasurer of the Navy , has told us that prices have advanced in France in as great a degree as here , and the right hon . member ( Mr. Vansittart ) bears
