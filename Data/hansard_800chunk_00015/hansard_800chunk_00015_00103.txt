, and I speak before another learned lord who must remember them too , and will set merightifmy memory is incorrect , I mean the noble and learned lord on the woolsack.—To him , though I so often differ with him , though I hare frequently and recently felt it my duty to arraign his public conduct . To him I confidently appeal—for no man is more attentive , more patiently attentive to the arguments of his adversary , and no man ( I am ready and happy to bear my testimony to that truth ) more fair , more candid , more acute , and yet more courteous in his way of contending with them . To him I appeal then as to what passed on that night , and as to the arguments which the noble and learned lord has imputed to me—I opposed that bill in toto . The noble and learned lord on the woolsack , explained one part of the bill to which I had objected , to my satisfaction , and to that part I withdrew , as in duty and conscience I was bound to withdraw , my opposition ; but for the other part which gave the new power of holding persons to bail on Ex Officio Informations , I heard no explanation , no apology , no reason ; nor have I since heard one word to prove it justice , or its necessity.—I opposed it therefore in every stage , but I never used the arguments or expressions which the noble and learned lord ( Ellenborough ) has supposed , nor any thing like them.—So far from indulging in the hyperbolical strain , which the learned lord 's fancy and not his memory repeats , the argument I did use was at variance with that which he puts into my mouth ; far from foretelling the immediate downfall of King , Lords , and Commons , from the bill , I distinctly stated , that I apprehended no immediate consequences , good , bad , or indifferent , from the law , but that it was the principle , it was the use to which in bad times it might , and would be applied , that my fears were directed to ; and though it is now two or three years ago , it so happens that I recollect the very metaphor I used , though not certainly a very happy or a very new one , but it illustrates the truth of my statement . It was , as far as I can recollect my expression , this , `` that the law would remain long torpid in your statute book , but it would lie there fraught with a venom , which the accidental heat of factious 170 and turbulent times might at some future period draw forth into action . '' Yet the noble lord is pleased to indulge his pleasantry and sarcasm by imputing to me a prophecy of immediate tyranny which I never uttered , and banters me with wonderful self-complacency at its not being accomplished ! Once for all , I never professed one of the principles against which the noble lord inveighs ; I never used one of the arguments which the noble and learned lord refutes ; I never made one of the statements which the noble and learned lord ridicules . He may attack them , he may answer them , he may expose them , but he has no right to impute ' them to me , or to think he is answering what I formerly said or have this night said on the subject . The noble Secretary of State too makes an ingenious and able defence , but it is the defence of a place that has not been attacked . No inference , says he , is to be drawn from the increase of prosecutions , because we all know how publications are increased , and the proportion prosecutions bear to them may not be greater now than formerly.—Be it so ; but we were not talking of the increase of prosecutions in general ; I
