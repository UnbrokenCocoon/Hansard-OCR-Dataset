laudable alacrity with which the militia of both countries have been ready at all moments of exigency to fly to each others 's assistance ; but independent of the time lost in giving legal effect to such voluntary offers of service , and the serious objections that attach in principle to troops having to deliberate at any time upon the duties they are to per-form ; there are many cases that may arise , and must arise where the power of making a distribution of the militia force , different from what the law at present permits , may be of the highest importance to the empire , and yet the necessity for it , not of that obvious and striking nature , which , like the exigency of rebellion or invasion , at once calls for the tender of the services required , It is obvious how much the power of stationing a corps of British militia in Ireland might facilitate , at this moment , the reinforcement of the British army in Portugal : and if a period should hereafter arrive , when , instead of the disposable force of the empire being employed , as at present , in a quarter where it in fact covers Ireland from attack , it should be . engaged in operations on the side of Holland , or the shores of the Baltic ; how materially might not the defence of Ireland depend on the power of making such a distribution , considering the means the enemy generally possess of assembling a force , and menacing Ireland from the western ports of the continent . The principle of a common militia for the empire , however obvious impolicy , must rest for its accomplishment on the growing sense of its importance . When the militia system was extended to Scotland in the year 1797 , it was not at first thought prudent to hazard the measure , by extending the services of the Scottish militia to England , and it was not till a subsequent year that the conditions of the 219 service of the Scottish regiment were assimilated to those of the English militia . It is not to be wondered at , therefore , if the extension of the principle to Ireland has not more immediately followed the union ; but the time ( lord C. said ) he was convinced was arrived , at least so he was led to be of opinion , from the communications he had had with individuals of both services , when this great work might be accomplished , under proper regulations , with the general concurrence , both of the British and Irish militia . When he spoke of regulations , he did it from a conviction , that to render the measure acceptable it was necessary that the gentlemen serving in the militia should be clearly apprised beforehand what the nature and extent of the inconvenience was to which , from the consolidation of the militias , they might be exposed . With this view , and from a persuasion that in any other supposible case than that of actual rebellion or invasion , it could only be deemed expedient to employ a proportion of each militia in the other country ; lord Castlereagh said , he was desirous of recommending , that the proportion should be fixed , not to be exceeded except in the event of rebellion or invasion ; that the tour of duty to serve in the other island , should he taken by the regiments in rotation , and that no regiment should remain on such service beyond a time to be limited . It had occurred to him to propose , that the number liable to be so employed at one time , should not exceed one-fourth of the British , and one-third of the Irish militia , which would furnish a transferable force : of about 10,000 men of the former , and 8,000 of the latter ; and that the period of the service of each regiment , out of its own island , should not exceed , at the utmost , two
