made . '' I have shewn an increase of revenue of more than 37,000,000l . within the period of 12 years , and of 20,000,000l . in the official value of our exports , the real value of which of course was much more largely augmented ; while the increase of Banknotes was little more than 10,000,000l . notwithstanding the almost total disapearance of the gold coin , to the amount of more than 30,000,000l . Here I may be allowed to refer to the authority of sir Francis Baring , who , although he thought 11,000,000l . was far more than sufficient for the remittance of the public revenue , was of opinion , `` that if the public revenue or trade required 1,000l . to be remitted to London formerly , and 2,000l . is required at present , there must be an addition of 1,000l . in paper . Country paper ( always too abundant ) takes its origin from a variety of sources , and can not be considered as a general medium of circulation . Bank of England notes constitute the only general paper currency , the only adequate reperesentation of the precious metals . They alone admit of correct regulation , because they issue from a single source . '' My hon . friend ( Mr. Huskisson ) however , in his pamphlet , suggests , `` that the amount of paper is not to be measured by the public revenue ; '' in proof of which assertion `` he thought it unnecessary to go into a minute statement of the course of proceeding in the Exchequer , although it is by such a detail that the proof would be most completely established . It was sufficient , he said , for him to state that in the evening of each day the whole receipt of revenue within that day was carried to the Bank ; and that from the Bank , the whole amount of such revenue may be , and probably is , put in circulation again 876 in the following day , in discounts or in government securities . '' I confess this surprised me a good-deal , because it is not merely for payments into the Exchequer that Bank notes are wanted , though even for that purpose a new necessity has been created since the payments in cash have been stopped ; because till then no Bank notes were permitted to be locked up in the Exchequer . Notes as large as 500,000l . in one sum have occasionally been locked up ; an amount not very likely to get into circulation . In 1803 , the notes in the exchequer amounted at one time to £2,409,000 In 1804. to 2,020,000 In 1805. to 3,021,000 In 1806. to 4,515,000 In 1807. to 6,289,000 In 1808 to 3,294,000 In 1809. to 526,000 In 1810. to 2,022,000 And in 1809 and 1810 , the Bank advances to government were more than three millions higher than in 1798 . It is , however , for the collection of the revenue throughout the kingdom , and for the remittance of it to London , in addition to the want created by our increased commerce , that paper became necessary infinitely more than for payments into the exchequer , and to supply the deficiency of specie which had been withdrawn . The latter seems not to have attracted notice in accounting for the increased issue of Bank notes . It is important , therefore , to shew the extent of it . The following statement will shew that the amount of gold in circulation in 1798 could not be over-rated at £40,000,000 .
