If it was of service to Africa to abolish the Slave Trade , the establishment of the colony of Sierra Leone had materially contributed to that service , by affording an opportunity of observing more accurately the transactions connected with it ; and of viewing whole districts depopulated by the civil wars stirred up by that shameful traffic . He repeated his joy that the affairs of the colony were to be investigated by a Committee of that House . They would see the necessity of doing something to compensate in some degree to Africa the evils which we had formerly occasioned her .

In consequence of this , he had been induced at that period to recommend the application of a certain portion to the expences of the current year ; and he had even the satisfaction to state to the House that the actual produce exceeded the estimate by 1,353,000l . He felt the greater satisfaction in stating this , as it afforded a practical refutation of reports which had gone abroad , calculated to give a gloomy view of the trade and finances of the country .
