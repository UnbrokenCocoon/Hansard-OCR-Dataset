who sanctioned the Report , I distinctly declare that there has not been among them any retrocession of opinion.â€”I wish also to make some observations upon a charge brought forward against the Committee by the noble lord , a charge , which has been repeatedly urged out of doors , `` That the Committee were guilty of a great breach of duty in having framed : a Report containing doctrines and com elusions diametrically opposite to the evidence of all the witnesses , except two , that they called before them `` It does not seem to me to be necessary , in order to defend the Committee , to question the accuracy of this assertion , for though it would he easy to shew , that the facts admitted by many of the witnesses , formed a complete refutation of their own doctrines , I prefer to allow the assertion to stand uncontradicted , and to endeavour to prove that the Committee acted wisely in not suffering themselyes to be entirely guided by the opinions given in the evidence . The Committee had a duty imposed on them by the House of this description ; to 1021 decide upon a great and difficult question , in respect to which , on one side , the principles of a very abstruse science were to be attended to , and on the other the details of the most complicated facts , and the most intricate practices of trade , were to be unravelled . The science of the case they were able to learn from books of established authority ; the facts and the practices they could only discover by the examination of those , who by profession were the most conversant with them . They therefore did not call before them men of great learning in the science of political economy , or those who were most competent to give opinions , but those men in business , who in the public estimation , were considered to be the best qualified to give that information on matters of fact which was wanting to regulate the extent , to which the principles of science were applicable , to enable them to form a correct judgment on the case to be decided upon . They did not select witnesses whose opinions were known to lean to the conclusions that the principles of political economy offered ; but they selected those who peculiarly claim the character of being , in the strictest sense , the decided advocates of those inferences which mere practice suggests . In doing so , it seems to me , that the Committee acted in the most correct and impartial manner ; that they could not have adopted any course so well calculated to enable them to form a just and safe decision . They almost seemed to declare by so doing , that they were sensible of being liable to be led astray by a leaning in favour of the abstract maxims of science ; and that they wished to expose any pre-existing opinions , they might have formed , to the test of the severest trial which they could discover . I there fore think that the conduct of the Committee in examining those only who were mere practical men , which is the cause of the evidence being all one way , so far from being censurable , should secure to them the praise and confidence of the House ; If it were an object to have avoided this charge of censure , it would have been easily attained ; it was only necessary for the Committee to have followed the example of the Secret Committee of 1797 , and to have examined one of their own members , the member for Southwark ( Mr. H. Thornton ) , and in this way , they might have given in evidence those sentiments so ably delivered by him in the first night 's debate in favour of the Report . 1022 If the committee had examined witnesses , all of whom concurred in opinion with that hon . member , then indeed they might have been exposed
