examined.—He , however , did not mean to say more of special juries than the law entitled him ; for of special juries , he might observe , as lord Hale had observed of criminal informations , that they could not try cases in which life or limb were affected ; and this was observable with regard to special juries , for the same reason that lord Hale said it was observable with respect to informations . The plain inference to be drawn from it was 144 this , that special juries were less favourable to the defendant in criminal causes than common juries ; and it is further worthy of remark , that till times com '' paratively recent , ( he believed Geo . 2d 's ) special juries could only be obtained by consent of both parties . Now all criminal informations were tried by special juries , and it would be trifling with their lord '' ships not to add , that strong and deep impressions had gone abroad , that there were even more reasons than the law contemplated for thinking them , as at present composed , less favourable to the subject than that which is enjoined by the constitution of the country in cases where life or limb are concerned.—These reasons , and the conviction that the punishment of libel differed from the punishment of all other crimes in this particular , that far from checking or diminishing the evil produced by that individual offence , it extended and aggravated it by giving a wider circulation , by publishing , if he might say so , a cheaper edition of the formidable paper , he felt that more than common pains should be taken to prevent the prosecutions by Ex Officio Informations , from being more frequent than prudence would dictate , or the exigency of the times absolutely require . On these grounds he should on some future occasion propose the following regulations . 1st , A limitation of the time at which it should be lawful to file Informations for libel , after the first publication ; for it was surely obvious , that while the time was unlimited , every periodical work might be for an indefinite period entirely dependent on an Attorney General : 2dly , He should propose to fix a period at which the Attorney General should , after filing an Information , be compelled to bring the accused to trial , to drop the prosecution , or to assign reasons and ask leave of the court for further time to collect his witnesses : 3dly , He should wish to limit the period at which the persons convicted for state libels , should be liable to be cal led up for judgment ; for a verdict in the present state of the law , might be perverted from the general purposes of punishment and example , into the means of intimidation and influence.—He should also move in the course of the session , unless such a measure came recommended from the other House , the repeal of that part of the 48th of the King , which gave to the Attorney General the power of holding to bail on Ex Officio Informations for misdemeanors.—He was aware that there 145 were two other remedies , one of which was founded on substantial justice , and the other enjoined by the principles of the constitution , which he owed some apology for not bringing forward . The first was that to which our ancestors in William and Mary 's time resorted to on a similar occasion ; namely , some provision to indemnify those who were accused , and either not brought to trial or acquitted , from the heavy and unjust losses they had sustained . But here he should be met with the principle that the crown paid no costs , and though injustice could never be right , he was not sufficiently acquainted with the practice of our laws to be able to estimate the consequences of introducing so new a principle into them , nor yet had he knowledge of details , or ingenuity
