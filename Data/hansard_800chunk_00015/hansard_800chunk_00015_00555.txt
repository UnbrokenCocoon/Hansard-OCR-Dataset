of those coined from 1778 to 1798 , for which no credit is taken here : and as there was then no temptation to send coin out of the country , or to melt it , the price of gold never having exceeded the Mint price in that whole period , ( except in a few months 1½d . an ounce , in 1783 , ) and was generally below it , we may fairly estimate the coin in circulation at 40,000,000l . after making large allowance for wear , & c. Mr. Wheatly , however , ( with the Mint account before him ) insists that the whole coin in circulation and deposit at the time he wrote , in 1806 or 1807 , when gold had not been higher than 4l . an cz. , did not exceed 5,000,000l . ; but that in 1792 it might have been from 10,000,000l , to 12,000,000l . To what an extent specie is withdrawn from circulation may be judged of from the collection of the revenue in the county in which I live ; a statement of which was furnished me lately by the gentleman who received it . The assessed taxes were 342,000l. , and of the excise that went through his hands 84,000l. , making a total of 426,000l. , of which he received 476l . 8s . in specie . The whole of the excise was in Bank of England notes ; and such part of the assessed taxes as was received in country Bank notes was converted into Bank notes , on the remittance to London . This I am persuaded will be thought a reasonably strong proof of the absolute necessity of a large increased issue of Bank paper , for the revenue only . How far the manufactures of the country have demanded an increase of it , may be judged of from the following instance . In the town of Manchester and its neighbourhood the annual payments before 1797 were about 1,040,000l. , of which two-thirds in specie , and one-third in Bank notes . The proportion in specie was then reduced to one-half , and afterwards to a third . Now the whole payments are 3,640,000l. , of which only 10 or 11,000l . are made in specie . In three other large towns in Lancashire the payments are supposed to be equal to these , amounting to 7,280,000l . in the whole , which shows the necessity for a large supply of Bank paper in that county only , as there is not a country Bank note issued in it . If then , in estimating the coin in 1798 , we rate it , instead of 878 40,000,000l . at £ 35,000,000 The Bank of England notes then in circulation were 11,278,000 . 46,278,000 Coin in circulation now ( perhaps a high estimate ) £3,000,000 Bank of England notes in circulation 23,000,000 26,000,000 Here then is a sum of 20,000,000l . in the whole less than in 1798 , notwithstanding the immense increase of our revenue , commerce , and manufactures ; from which , however , should be taken the amount in deposit in the Bank , whatever that may be . Is it not then matter of surprise that the issue of Bank notes has not been greater , than the sum abovementioned ? And can it be advisable in the judgment of any reflecting man to make a sudden and considerable reduction of the paper ? If it were admitted , contrary to all experience and to the opinion of the enlightened men selected by the Committee , that the good effects supposed by the Committee would be produced by such a proceeding , the mischief that would inevitably follow to the manufacturers and traders , would greatly overweigh them . The necessity indeed would be so urgent , as to compel the issue of some paper , on security less substantial than that of the Bank * . Sir Francis Baring says , — '' The only general circulating medium , as a general representative of bullion at home , is Bank of England notes .
