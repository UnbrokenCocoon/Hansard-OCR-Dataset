wilful disobedience of the law , has been deemed to be an offence under the statute , and has subjected the party charged to protracted prosecution and ex-pence ; for transgressions of no higher malignity than this , the petitioners are liable to a severity of punishment which would be deemed adequate atonement for the most aggravated misdemeanor . In several instances , persons have been entrapped into a violation of the law by common informers , and have been prosecuted under circumstances which implied no blame whatever ; the offences too , of which such may be the ruinous consequences , an withdrawn from the impartial and human '' cognizance of a jury , and decided upon 180 summary proceedings before a single justice of the peace ; no appeal to the quarter sessions from the decision of the justice is allowed , the magistrate has not even the power of mitigating the penalty in the most favourable circumstances , nor will any number of convictions bar farther proceedings , while a single copy can be produced on which a penalty has not been awarded , and the common informer being exempted from the payment of costs in case of failure , is not deterred from repeating his vexatious attempts to obtain a conviction ; and that , as the petitioners are amenable to the laws for any seditious , immoral , irreligious , or libellous books or papers , which they may be guilty of printing and publishing , they submit with becoming humility to the House , that it is unnecessary to secure , by such excessive accumulation of penalties , a compliance with a regulation which , in case of an inoffensive paper , they can have no interest to omit , and of which the punishment is so disproportioned to the offence . If the publication be of an illegal nature , or of a dangerous tendency , the printer is discovered when there is evidence to convict him of neglecting the regulation of the act , and he may be punished according to the degree of guilt which he has really incurred . The House , indeed , can not doubt that the provisions in question have been converted into an engine of vexation and oppression to the petitioners , without any benefit to the public , when they are informed , that , in every instance of prosecution , the publication on which the . printer has been sued has been of an innocent or even useful nature ; in most cases , though the punishment may be so severe , an improper motive can not even be imputed to the offender , there is no temptation to fraudulent evasion , and the occasions on which the printer is most likely to expose himself to exorbitant forfeitures , are those in which his vigilance is beguiled by the innocence of the matter . Contemplating disobedience to this act he would guard against detection , but in printing an harmless hand bill , he does not reflect that he may forfeit 100,000l . by the forget fulness of a moment ; all the chances of escape are reserved for deliberate violation of the law , and the utmost severity of forfeiture is incident to casual inadvertency ; and the petitioners beg leave further to submit to the House , that , while penalties and inconveniencies of such serious magnitude may be incurred without 181 any intention to violate the law , and without any criminal negligence of conduct , persons of common prudence must be deterred from engaging in an occupation attended with such hazard . The petitioners are the principal sufferers by the hardships , laid upon a business from which they expected to gain a reputable subsistence , and which it is too late for them to abandon , but the discouragement so severely felt by them , will ultimately prove injurious to the public at large , since it must tend to banish capital , ability , and reputation from a branch of industry by which numbers of persons are now honourably supported , from which no inconsiderable revenue is derived
