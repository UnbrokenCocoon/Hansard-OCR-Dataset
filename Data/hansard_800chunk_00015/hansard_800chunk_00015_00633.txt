in future times of corresponding emergency , recourse must be had , if a similar necessity should recur to preserve public credit from the fatal consequences of ignorant alarm , or fraudulent operations upon our coin . I have no hesitation in admitting , that , like the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act , Or the exercise of martial law , it is a surrender , for the time , of the sound and legitimate regulations of our ordinary system ; the object has been , on these occasions , by such temporary surrender , to preserve the system itself from destruction . It is the more material that the true character and tendency of the Restriction Bill should not be Misconceived , as the circulation of this country , for reasons which I shall now explain , and from causes not with in the province of law to regulate , but growing out of the habits of bur people , and the increased confidence between man and man , is likely to undergo a change , which , although in most respects advantageous , may hereafter render it more vulnerable to injuries of the description from which we now suffer . 995 When I speak of our circulation in a sound state , I mean a circulation , composed of Bank-paper and coin , in such proportions as will enable any man to convert , at his pleasure , his notes into coin . I do not consider a circulation , purely metallic , or wholly of notes , as falling within this description ; the former is only the device of barbarous ages , and wholly incompatible with the extended wants of a commercial country such as this ; and the latter is defective , however well administered , when not convertible into coin , in being exposed , from ignorance , misstatement , and public alarm , to distrust and discredit . When I admit that a mixed circulation , such as was established by law previous to the Bank Restriction Bill , is the only sound and natural state of our currency , yet the Committee will perceive , even when the circulation exists in this its most perfect state , that it must depend on the habits of the country , and not on institutions of positive law , in what proportion the precious metals shall remain in use . If coin is little in demand—if all bargains are made in paper—if the people prefer paper as more convenient , except for the smaller payments , as more rapid in its circulation , and of more easy application to all purposes of sale and purchase—if guineas are little sought after , where the credit of the particular paper in use is not suspected , and , when it is , if the holders of such suspected paper are only desirous of converting it into other paper of more undoubted character , —it is plain the quantity of coin circulating within the country , compared with the paper , will be proportionably small . The various banking establishments will frame the scale of their cash balances upon the accustomed demand for guineas ; less coin will exist in the hands of private individuals ; and , although the Bank of England may , upon principles of provident caution , not allow their stock of guineas to be diminished , yet the collective coin of the whole system will be less ; and in the same proportion will it be exposed to be affected , either by those causes , which may suddenly revive an internal demand for coin , or by those external influences which , by drawing away the precious metals , first in the shape of bullion , and , secondly , of coin illicitly exported , must have a tendency to disturb a system , where the coin is not in such abundance as to bear any very considerable reduction . That such may be our situation , if the country flourishes and credit improves , 996 may be inferred from observing the distinct character which the habits of the people had
