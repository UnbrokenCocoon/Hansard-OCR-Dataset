entertain a wish to be relieved from having a large supply , having in this , and all other instances , always governed itself by an attention to the public interest as-well as its own . '' Unquestionably this statement of Mr. Pearsels falls short of a distinct and positive declaration of an opinion , that the restriction of cash payments-ought to be made a permanent measure . But it is quite evident that the possibility of its 824 being made a permanent measure had passed through that gentleman 's mind when he could have been brought himself to declare that `` he was not a ware of any positive inconvenience resulting from the present operation of the Restriction Bill of likely to result from its being rendered permanent . '' Now , when to this declaration we add the doctrine maintained by both the governor and deputy governor of the Bank , that there can be no excessive issue of paper , as long as the actual issue is confined to the existing demand for it and also the very zealous and active-part taken by the Directors of the Bank in the discussion of this question out of doors ; enough appears in my humble judgment to warrant the conclusion , that the propper checks have , not operated upon the Bank ; issues , and that consequently the present depreciation of the currency is entirely owing to the excessive issue of bank notes . It seems , however , that there is a large class of merchants in the metropolis , who , filled with the same erroneous notions as the governor and deputy governor of the Bank , deny this obvious conclusion , ' anti still continue to contend that , regulated as the operations of the Bank are regulated , there can be no excess of paper currency . But whatever may be the weight and respectability of these gentlemen , and no man can be mote ready than myself to do justice to both , I must still contend that their view of the subject is fallacious ; and false , and in this opinion I am fortified by the concurrence of a very large majority of the mercantile community-a majority consisting of all the great old capitalists of the city , whose practice and praise it has been to have supported through good and through evil times the commercial credit of Great Britain . These gentles , men , to whose authority on such a subject as this , now under our consideration , the Committee will , I am sure , be prepared to show every deference and respect , are decidedly of opinion , ( contrary to : the visionary speculations of those to whom I have just alluded ) that the issues of the Bank have not been regulated by the principles , or the precedents of good old times ; and : that the departure from the previously established regulations at the Bank has indisputably led to the depreciation of the currency to which it is now my object to direct the attention of the Committee . Amongst the eminent and distinguished commercial men who coincided in the 825 views of this question taken by the Bullion Committee , I can refer with confidence to a most respectable individual now unfortunately no more , ( the late sir Francis Baring ) whose opinion , no less from his known integrity , than his extensive commercial experience , and highly cultivated intellect , is entitled to as much consideration and attention as that of any other individual in the whole range of the mercantile community . It was the opinion of sir Francis Baring , that there could be no security against an excessive issue of paper , unless in the optional convertibility of paper into coin . The Committee were anxious to ascertain precisely the opinions of that intelligent merchant upon this subject , and with that view he was asked : `` Are you of opinion that any certain and adequate provision can be made against an occasional excess of paper circulation in any country , and especially in
