, of which , without urgent reason , it did not seem right to demand a disclosure . The late governor and deputy-governor however , at the desire of your Committee , furnished a comparative scale , in progressive , numbers , shewing the increase of the amount of their discounts from the year 1790 to 1809 , both inclusive . They made a request , with which your Committee have thought it proper to comply , that this document might not be made public ; the Committee , therefore , have not placed it in the Appendix to the present Report , but have returned it to the Bank . Your Committee , however , have to stale , in , general terms , that the amount of the discount has been progressively increasing since the year 1796 , and that their amount in last year ( 1809 ) bears a very high proportion to their largest amount in any year preceding 1797 . Upon this particular subject your Committee are only anxious to remark , that the largest amount of mercantile discounts by the Bank , if it could be considered by itself , ought never , in their judgment , to be regarded as any other than a great public benefit , and that it is only the excess of paper currency thereby issued and kept out in circulation , which is to be considered as the evil . '' Whether the discounts have been progressively increasing since 1796 , it is not in my power to say , but that is important only so far as the issue of Bank paper may or may not have been increased thereby . Let us therefore see how that stands , including even the notes under 5l . which have been issued more to serve as change than for any other purpose in the last eight years of that period . 1802 . July 17,094,000 1803 . Jan. 15,650,000 July 14,290,000 1804 . Jan. 17,151,000 July 16,974,000 1805 . Jan. 17,849,000 July 15,674,080 1806 . Jan. 16,295,000 1807 . 16,004,000 1808 16,619,000 1809 . 17,397,000 And without small notes , or Bank Post Bills , the circulation 873 In 1791 , was £ 10,864,000 In 1809 , 13,302,000 Then follows , `` But your Committee must not omit to state one very important principle , that the mere numerical return of the Bank-notes out in circulation can not be considered as at all deciding the question , whether such paper is or is not excessive ? It is necessary to have recourse to other tests . The same amount of paper may , at one time , be less than enough , and at another time , more . The quantity of currency required , will vary , in some degree , with the extent of trade ; and the increase of our trade , which has taken place since the suspension , must have occasioned some increase in the quantity of our currency . `` —And after reasoning upon the quantity of currency bearing no proportion to the quantity of commodities , the Committee say , they `` are of opinion , that the improvements which have taken place of late years in this country , and particularly in the district of London , with regard to the use and œeconomy of money among bankers , and in the mode of adjusting commercial payments , must have had a much greater effect than has hitherto been ascribed to them , in rendering the same sum adequate to a much greater amount of trade and payments than formerly ; some of those improvements will be found detailed in the evidence : they consist principally in the increased use of bankers drafts in the common payments of London ; the contrivance of bringing all such drafts daily to a common receptacle where they are balanced against each other ; the intermediate agency of bill brokers ; and several other changes in the practice of London bankers , are to the same effect , of rendering it unnecessary for them to keep so large a desposit of money as formerly .
