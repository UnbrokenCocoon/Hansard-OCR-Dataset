average price of the quarter of wheat was 2l . 11s . ½ , 1025 from 1701 to 1764 , both inclusive , 2l . 6d. , and from 1764 to 1793 , both inclusive , 2l . 5s . 10d . But from 1794 to 1808 both inclusive , the price has been 3l . 15s . 6d . This great rise since 1794 is a circumstance , the explanation of which is of the greatest importance to the present discussion . But so great a variation in price is not without a precedent ; a still greater took place after the discovery of the American mines , and as the cause of it has been fully explained by Dr. Adam Smith , it seems to be a safe way of proceeding in looking for the cause of the late rise , to follow the course of reasoning which he has adopted . Though objections have been made to his doctrine , that the prices of corn formed the best standard for calculating the value of money , and though it may be liable to be considered as inconsistent with his reasonings about labour as a standard of value , still it has been allowed by every one to be sufficiently accurate for the purpose of ascertaining the value of the precious metals ; and that part therefore of his work which relates to them , has been generally : received as of established authority . The facts which he states as to the rise of the price of corn are these : `` In 1350 , and for some time before , the average price of the quarter of wheat in England seems not to have been estimated lower than four ounces of silver , equal to about 20s . of our money . From this price it seems to have fallen gradually to two ounces of silver , equal to about 10s . of our present money , the price at which it was estimated , in the beginning of the 16th century , and at which it seems to have continued to be estimated till about 1570 From 1595 to 1621 , both inclusive , the average price of the quarter of middle wheat was 1l . 12s . 8d.8/5 or about 6⅓ ounces of silver . From 1621 to 1636 , both inclusive , the average price of the quarter of middle wheat was 1l . 19s . 6d . or about 7⅔ ounces of silver '' `` The discovery of the abundant mines of America '' ( he says ) `` seems to have been the sole cause of this , diminution , in the value of silver in proportion to that of corn ; it is accounted , for accordingly , in the same manner by every body , and there , never has been any dispute either about the fact , or about the cause of it . '' Again he says , `` when after the discovery of the abundant mines of America , corn rose to three and four times its former price , this change was universally ascribed , 1026 not to any rise in the real value of corn but to a fall in the real value of silver . '' The conclusion then to be drawn from this precedent , and from the writings of Dr. A. Smith , is this , that a great nominal rise in the price of corn , is a proof of a great fall in the real value of the precious metals , in which the price is estimated . Let us then apply this case and this conclusion to the recent advance of prices , with a view of ascertaining whether the value of gold has risen or fallen . The price of the quarter of wheat from 1764 , the period to which he brought down his tables of prices , to 1794 , both inclusive , was 2l . 5s . 10d. , and , may be estimated at 280 grains of gold . The price of the quarter of wheat from 1795 to 1808 both inclusive ,
