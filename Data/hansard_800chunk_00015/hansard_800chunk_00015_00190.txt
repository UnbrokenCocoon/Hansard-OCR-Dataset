they will applaud rather than censure the conduct of government . Indeed , even now , many of the most respectable Catholics do not disguise their opinion , that the conduct of the Committee had thrown discredit upon the Catholic cause , and had endangered the peace of the country . It certainly was a subject of consolation to the lord lieutenant to know , that a number of respectable Catholic gentlemen were coming to Dublin to put an end to this Committee themselves ; and , therefore , the Irish government , though still watching their proceedings , determined not to molest them . beg leave here , Sir , to call the attention of the House to a statement of the right hon . and learned gent . : he says , that the resolutions of the Committee , of the 26th of February , reassert all that had been asserted before , and that they declared themselves to be that very illegal assembly which the government had threatened to disperse . Now , I do beg the right hon . and learned gent , will look at the resolutions themselves , and 305 see whether they bear him out in that proposition ; I maintain that they prove the direct contrary : but , it seems , that these friends of the Catholics on the other side of the House will not allow the word of a Catholic to be taken upon any occasion ; and the Irish government are termed drivellers and blockheads , because , being gentlemen themselves , they believed the word of a gentleman .

The first resolution relates to the publishing my correspondence with lord Ffrench . The second states , `` that this Committee has been appointed by an aggregate meeting of the Catholics of Ireland ; '' to do what ? to manage the affairs of the Catholics ? No ! â€” '' to prepare , and procure to be presented to parliament , on
