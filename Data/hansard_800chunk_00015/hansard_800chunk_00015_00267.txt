It might be said that the defalcation arose from the difficulties tinder which the commerce of the country was placed ; but that was not the cause , it was the result of over-taxation . Articles of luxury were so heavily bur-thened , that the poverty of the people prevented the consumption , and consequently the revenue was injured ; by imposing additional taxes the preceding ones were lost ; so by pouring in a drop more than the vessel could hold , it was lost ! He then went into a comparative statement of the produce of the revenue at the period in which he held the office now occupied by the right hon . gent . * See Vol . 2 , p. 773 . 425 ( Mr. Foster ) and the present period , contending , that during the time he officiated , the taxes produced much more than he calculated . The expence of collecting the revenue had greatly increased since 1807 . At that time the ex-pence was about 487,000l . Last year it amounted to 720,000l . of which sum more than 220,000l . was absorbed by the two boards of customs and excise for incidental expences , and distributed among the clerks , the superannuated list , for building , of various kinds , and for new docks ( which by the bye , in England were erected , not at government but at individual ex-pence ) . Among the items of charges was one for stationary , amounting to 28,000l . the charge on England was only 18,000l . The duty on leather in 1799 , produced 51,000l . ; and in 1811 , a period of eleven years , when it might be supposed that the population had increased , the produce had been only 41,000l . The right hon . baronet , after stating some other supposed grievances , declared that in submitting his propositions to the House , he did not wish to compromise them to form any hasty opinion on the subject , all he required was , that the matters referred to should undergo complete investigation ; he therefore trusted , that the Resolutions would be passed and allowed to be printed , and on some future day the gentlemen opposite would be prepared to shew that his statement was not incorrect . He then moved the following Resolutions : 1 . `` That the Funded Debt of Ireland has nearly trebled within ten years , and amounted , on the 5th of January 1811 , to 89,72s . 992l . occasioning an annual permanent charge for interest , Sinking Fund and management , of 4,273,000l . to which head of expenditure alone , the entire ordinary revenue of Ireland , amounting in the last year to only 3,614,000l . has become wholly inadequate . 2 . '' That the various plans submitted to , and adopted by parliament , for raising the amount of the Irish Revenue by increased taxation , to defray the Irish quota of expenditure , or even to make due provision for discharging the interest of the loans , have totally failed to answer the desired object , inasmuch as the net revenue of 1810 is 800,000l . below that of the year 1807 , although taxes , estimated to produce more than 900,000l . were imposed , and 862,000l . added to the charge of the Public Debt during that interval . 3 . `` That for this failure of estimated 426 revenue , which has been progressive during several years , although most striking in that which has just elapsed , no adequate causes can be discovered in the commercial difficulties of the empire , since the intercourse between
