to be published or dispersed , whether the same shall be sold or given away , shall print upon the front of every such paper , if the same shall be printed on one side only , and upon the first and last leaves of every paper or book which shall consist of more than one leaf , in legible characters , his or her name , and the name of the city , town , parish , or place , and also the name , if any , of the square , street , lane , court , or place in which his or her dwelling house or usual place of abode shall be ; and every person who shall omit so to print his name and place of abode on every such paper or book printed by him , and also every person who shall publish or disperse , or assist in publishing or dispersing , either gratis or for money , any printed paper or book which shall have been printed after the expiration of forty days from the passing of this act , and on which the name and place of abode of the person printing the same shall not be printed as aforesaid , shall for every copy of such paper so published or dispersed by him forfeit and pay the sum of 20l . ; ' and that the petitioners , sensible of the policy of preventing the dissemination of 'treasonable , irreligious , immoral , ' or libellous publications , submit , without repining , to a variety of regulations , by which their occupation is treated as of a character so suspicious , as to stand in need of preliminary securities for anticipated misbehaviour , and is subject to jealous and irksome restraints to which no other branch of useful and honest industry is condemned ; but though the petitioners have anxiously endeavoured to comply with the provisions of the law , they have found themselves exposed , by accidental mistake or trivial omission , to grievous and vexatious prosecutions , and to the danger of incurring pecuniary penalties to an 179 enormous amount , without having been guilty of any thing offensive to morals , religion , or government ; that , by the above-recited act , a penalty of 20l . is imposed for every copy of any book or paper printed without the name or place of abode of the printer being thereto affixed with the most minute precision ; and the petitioners humbly represent to the House , that the accidental violation of this part of the act , in the most inconsiderable circumstance , is attended with a severity of punishment which could not have been foreseen or intended .

In fact , printers have in various instances been harrassed by repeated prosecutions for different copies of the same publication ; the omission of the word `` London '' in the description of a printer 's place of abode , in addition to that of a well-known street in the metropolis , which precluded all sapposition of
