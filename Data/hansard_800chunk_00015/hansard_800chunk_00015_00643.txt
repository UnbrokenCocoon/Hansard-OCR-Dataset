is as abortive as all his former . The experience of the last three years has shewn him the exports of the British empire increased one fourth , in contempt of all his decrees ; and , although he has succeeded in adding heavily to the costs of our European imports , as well as to our losses from confiscations , and , as far as relates to the continent , in turning the balance of payments largely against us , yet have we succeeded , in the face of his prohibitions , in exporting , even to the continent of Europe , nearly three times as much in actual value , as we did in time of profound peace , when all the continental ports were open to us , and when we had a commercial treaty with France herself . What a proof is this of the importance of an internal system of circulation , in its nature placed beyond the reach of his power , steadily supporting the industry of the country , its true and only wealth , accommodating itself to the rising exertions of a laborious population , and resting on the credit of a Bank , the solidity of whose resources has never yet been called in question . Let us determine to cherish this system , which keeps the enemy 's power at a distance , till the world is once more restored to a settled order of things . The whole case of the Committee is built upon an assumption that we live in ordinary times , and that we may conduct ourselves upon accustomed principles . They reason as if every thing was to find its level at a moment when the licentious subversion of all hose ancient principles , which have governed the conduct of nations , even when at war , compels us , in self-defence , to assume an attitude of defiance correspondent to the novel efforts 1010 employed for our destruction . It is the strength , as well as the pride of this nation that a long established system of public credit , the voluntary growth of industry protected by a free constitution and established laws , enables us to conduct our transactions , without the perpetual intervention of our standard coin . In its absence the accredited paper of our banks preserves its established relation to the general property of the country , which it continues to circulate , with an uniformity of value which could not belong to it , if tied down to bullion as the standard , and obliged to conform to all the present convulsive fluctuations in its price . Out of the necessity of abandoning for a time the convertibility of paper into cash , has grown an increased facility of conducting your expenditure abroad , in proportion to the quantity of the precious metals exported ; and we have found that , when the means of sending bullion hence have been exhausted , wherever our arms have been carried , foreign gold has been supplied upon credits here , the amount of which was either returned to those countries in British commodities , or invested in our funds : thus supplying fresh resources from the capital of the foreigner for conducting the war . The Committee , I trust , will do me the justice to remember , that I have throughout admitted a recurrence to cash payments as early as circumstances will permit , to be essential to public credit , that I have justified the existing system upon the plea alone of an over-ruling necessity , that I have not considered such a necessity as belonging to ordinary times of war , but as arising out of the new principles on which the present war has been conducted by the enemy . When the necessity ceases , I trust the system now in operation will cease with it ; and I am sanguine in my belief that , with industry and commerce so flourishing , the return of our former habits , the drain of war being at an end , will not be a work of
