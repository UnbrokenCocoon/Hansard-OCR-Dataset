talents in the general opposed to him . Massena was therefore selected : Massena , the most fortunate of all the French generals , to repair the losses sustained by so many other French marshals , and an army was placed at his disposal , the largest that the means of France could collect ; but as it was presumptuously anticipated fully competent to the complete reduction of the kingdom of Portugal by the speedy and effectual expulsion of the British army from that country . This French army was composed of a force so numerous , so arranged , and so appointed in every respect , as to render it a fit instrument under the command of Massena , for the purpose of undertaking and accomplishing the extensive and long meditated expedition against Portugal . That expedition was not hastily undertaken ; it was known to be long under consideration , deliberately resolved on , in a high state of preparation , and it was placed under the command and direction of the ablest and most expert commander France could boast of . The great and cardinal object of lord Wellington under these circumstances was at all events the defence of Portugal ; which he was persuaded he could main-lain against any force which it was probable that France would send ; considering Lisbon and its vicinity as the great pivot on which his system must turn , fortified as the positions there would be by the skill of our engineers , added to the local defences which nature had already made so strong . The foundation of the necessary works had been begun in the winter before last , and had been proceeded in and completed , tranquilly and unostentatiously : these works formed the great basis of the plan of defence . The British general was perfectly aware from the beginning , of the great importance of not hastily risking the safety of the gallant army under his command ; and of looking for the defence of the country , not to measures which might probably succeed , but to measures founded upon a safe and prudent policy : by which he judged wisely , as the event had shewn , that success would finally be obtained . He wished , therefore , as long as possible , to keep the enemy on the frontiers , and defer their invasion to a later season of the year . In this view of the subject of defence there were two objects before him ; the first , not hastily to risk the army ; the second , the conviction that the security of Portugal depended on the hearty co-operation of the people , and the speedy equipment and discipline of the Portuguese troops . Much of the credit , success , and fame of the campaign must rest on a prudent policy ; since it was well known , that a newly raised force would be most likely to take their future character from what they might prove to be on the first occasion of their being brought into action . If they were then successful , they were likely to maintain their reputation . 763 Had he placed the Portuguese troops at first in a situation of fighting , unattended with local or other advantages , and had he been disappointed in the result , much time might have been required before the first unfavourable results could have been corrected . Thus , it might appear , when it was considered how large a proportion of lord Wellington 's force was composed of Portuguese , that the prudent and defensive system was that which it was wise to adopt.â€”If their lordships would look at the nature and magnitude of the effort of the enemy , they would see that it bore no resemblance to some of those hasty and rapid armaments which had been made by France when engaged in war with different powers : but that , to invade Portugal , France , not at war with any of the powers of Europe , save the nations of the Peninsula , had deliberately prepared the means
