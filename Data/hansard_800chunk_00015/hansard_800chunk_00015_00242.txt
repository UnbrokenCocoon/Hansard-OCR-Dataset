as that of the Amendment he had moved in the Committee in the Bill , viz . `` That Roman Catholics and other dissenters should be permitted to attend divine worship according to such rites as their consciences suggested , and not be compelled to attend at divine service according to the rites of the Established Church . '' was furnished with a sufficient answer to the arguments of the noble earl , by the acknowledgments in his own speech . The noble earl confessed that the only case which was reported to the noble commander in-chief in Ireland , met with immediate redress ; and that with regard to the case in Sicily , it came to the noble earl in the shape of an ex-parte statement , and was confessed to be such by a right hon . member of the other House of Parliament ( Mr. Grattan ) , who was requested to introduce it into his statement on his presenting the Roman Catholic Petition in 1809 , but who declined doing so , on finding that it was an ex-parte statement . This he conceived to be a sufficient answer to all the observations of the noble earl . vindicated the conduct of the Irish government with respect to these matters , both during the five years he had been employed in that country , and also during the government of his predecessor . For the whole of that 387 time he had never heard of any one complaint of the nature now brought forward ; and had any such ground of complaint been brought forward , he was sure it Would have been instantly removed . He could not but regret that the noble earl who brought forward this question , no doubt with the best intentions , should have glanced at matters , and even made assertions , into the truth of which he had not sufficiently inquired .

Could a legislative declaration create , did it not rather remove all doubt in such circumstances ? and as making the matter clear and intelligible to all the world , it was his opinion that such a legislative declaration should be adopted . vindicated both the government of Ireland and England from imputation or blame with regard to their conduct towards the Roman Catholic soldiers . thought it would greatly promote the recruiting service that a general legislative-declaration should be adopted , to remove all doubts and hesitations on this very important point . briefly replied , and said he should not divide the House on his proposition , as the noble lords connected with Ireland were absent , who , if present , would have strenuously supported himâ€”The noble earl 's proposition was therefore negatived without a division ; the Bill read a third time and passed . then rose and said , that in rising to call the 388 attention of the Committee to that part of his royal highness the Prince Regent 's message , which referred to the subject of granting still further assistance to Portugal , he could not forbear to express a confident expectation that there would not be much opposition made to the motion with which he should have the honour to conclude . Although the proposition which he had last year brought forward on the same subject had met with some opposition , and though the grant which it was in this instance his intention to submit to the Committee amounted to a considerable increase beyond the sum voted last year , he yet conceived , that , in the circumstances under which he made the present application
