evidence . These were the great points to which their attention was directed , and , if the worst came to the worst , they knew they should only have to pay a visit to Harry , Tom , or Sue , or some old acquaintance beyond sea , who had so mismanaged their business as to have been stupid , and unlucky enough to have been detected , prosecuted , convicted , and transported . This was 642 the sort of language invariably held by all the convicts , with whom my informant had occasionally conversed on such subjects , during the time of his holding a public situation in that country . But he remembered having learned from one convict in particular , a whimsical anecdote , respecting great doubts , and difficulties , and discordancy in opinion , between their attorney and solicitor-general , and their other law officers , whom a gang , to which the convict belonged , had consulted , as to the safest mode of robbing waggons . All sorts of intricacies presented themselves , and perplexities , and distinctions ( whether well or ill founded matters not ) about robbing waggons on the highway , in motion , at rest , at inn doors , in inn yards , under sheds , or not under sheds , & c. & c. Nobody could understand the subject . Nobody felt certain what the consequences would be . What was the effect of this uncertainty , this confusion , this obscurity , of this unknown danger , of which they could not calculate the extent ? Why , that the poor waggons escaped scot free . Nobody would venture to touch them . Such are the admissions , such the statements , and such the modes of reasoning , and of acting , of those miserable men , on whose minds the laws are to operate . And if the minds of those who are practised in depredation so reason , how much more so will the minds of those so reason who are for the first time meditating to depart from the path of their duty.â€”Such then is the authority of the criminals themselves . What is the authority of those , who from the nature of their judicial situations , have their attention constantly and practically directed to this subject , and who are almost daily in the habit of observing how the laws operate upon the mind ? I refer to their view of this matter , as to that of spectators , who see the object nearer than we do . I do not quote their opinions , as authority , to govern or direct the conduct of the House . I appeal to them as witnesses . I refer to the evidence of intelligent , respectable and enlightened men . And feeling as I do , the extreme importance of ascertaining the opinions of practical men on these subjects , who have a closer and more continued insight into the operations of the criminal law than we can have , I am very anxious to be permitted to read , as part of my speech , certain Questions , which have been proposed to very able and experienced magistrates , the law officers of the city of 643 London , together with their Answers to these questions . I repeat that I do not do this , as if I was referring to authority , which ought to govern our conduct ; but merely as to materials , which may contribute to enlighten our judgment . said , if he thought the motion of his hon . and learned friend 649 contradicted any settled opinion , or encroached on any established principles of the constitution , he should be one of the last men to rise in its support . But he believed that neither he nor his hon . and learned friend were remarkable for any exertions of a mere political tendency against the ministers of the crown or the government of the country . The question before the House was of a very different nature , and
