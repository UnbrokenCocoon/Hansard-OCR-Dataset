other proceedings on felonies under the revenue laws , in aid of that judicious and benevolent inquiry , in which , at the instance of his noble friend , a committee of their lordships was at present employed . In addition to this general view of their duties , and exclusive of those primâ facie grounds on which he ( lord Holland ) rested some suspicion of abuse , their lordships , without agreeing with him in that inference , would be justified in requiring further information on a subject on which they had so recently legislated , for the purpose of ascertaining the uses to which the new law had been applied , and the consequences it had produced ; and this argument was yet more forcible , when he recollected the circumstances under which the act he had alluded to was passed , in a thin House , at the lag-end of a session , and without any one person to explain the nature of its provisions , or assign the reasons on which they were founded . In such manner , however , was an act altering the antient law of the land , giving to the silent and spontaneous , act of one man , all the powers and consequences of a solemn proceeding of a grand jury , introduced and passed through parliament 131 in the summer of 1808 . When he recollected that to justify that extraordinary innovation , to lay grounds for that unexpected attack on the liberty of the subject , to prove the necessity of arming the Attorney General with the power of holding to bail , and in some cases , of imprisoning whomever he thought , guilty of a libel ; no papers were moved for , no inquiry instituted , no documents produced , nay , no statement whatever made , further than was to be found in the meagre , un satisfactory , and unsubstantiated preamble of the Bill ; when he recollected this , he felt that his expectation of his motion being acceded to by the supporters of that Bill , was rather a proof of his own simplicity , than a fair consequence to be drawn from the former conduct of those noble persons . He complimented them on their consistency in refusing all information respecting the consequence of a law , for the enactment of which they had assigned no reasons , and for the allegations in which they had adduced no evidence ; but surely it was natural for their lordships , who , if they had reasons for adopting the law , must have adopted it for the purpose of preventing offences and `` curing the ends of public justice , to inquire whether those ends had been accomplished ; to learn how often and with what effect the provisions of the new law had been resorted to ; to ascertain whether libels had increased or diminished since these new powers had been granted ; and , above all , to discover whether the convictions obtained bore a greater proportion to the informations laid , than they did before the latter were armed with such unusual , and , hitherto , unconstitutional consequences.—On such grounds , the House seemed to him called upon to adopt the motion which he should that night make ; but he did not mean to disguise from their lordships , that he had further views in making it , that he thought other circumstances required inquiry , and that the information which his motion , if acceded to , would produce , would lead to the necessity of other proceedings . He would say little of his own motives in coming forward on the occasion , but he must trouble the House with one or two observations in disclaiming the intentions , which , he feared , those most adverse to his views , and those most eager in their condemnation of all prosecutions for libel , might concur in imputing to him . It was not his intention to meddle with the law of 132 libel ; as he should afterwards explain , he did
