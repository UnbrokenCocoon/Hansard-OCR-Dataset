own notes , with liberty to issue new paper to the extent of the addition made to their capital . The remedy was , however , so far from being effectual , that so early as 1708 the credit of the Bank failed again , which led to the necessity of raising the interest of their advances to the public from 3 to 6 per cent . ; when the crisis was such as to induce lord Godolphin , the duke of Marlborough , and others , to support them with their private credit . The Committee next derive a sanction 866 for their reasonings from what passed in 1804 , respecting the depreciation of the Irish exchange . They say , `` Many of the witnesses before the Committee , ( in 1804 ) however unwilling to acknowledge the real nature of the evil , made important concessions which necessarily involved them in inconsistency . They could not , as practical men , controvert the truth of the general position , that the fluctuations of exchange between two countries are generally limited by the price at which any given quantity of bullion can be purchased in the circulating medium of the debtor country , and converted into the circulating medium of the creditor country , together with the insurances and charges of transporting it from the one to the other . It was at the same time admitted that the expence of transporting gold from England to Ireland , including insurance , was then under one percent . ; that before the restriction the fluctuations had never long and much exceeded this limit ; and moreover , that the exchange with Belfast , where guineas freely circulated , at the time of the investigation by that Committee , was then l¼ per cent . in favour of Ireland , while the exchange with Dahlia , where only paper was in use , was 10 per cent . against that country . It also appeared from such imperfect documents as it was practicable to furnish , that the balance of trade was then favourable to Ireland . '' On which subject the Committee appear to me again to have fallen into a train of errors . On the subject of remitting by bills or bullion , and their comparative advantages , I have already addressed the Committee ; but I must arrest their atttention here for a moment , to show how unfounded the statement in the report is in regard to the balance of trade being at the period in question , in favour of Ireland . From documents before the House it appears that the imports and exports of Ireland were then as follows : Imports . Exports including foreign goods . 1802 . £ 6,087,000 £5,090,000 1803 . 5,275,000 4,770,000 1804 5,712,000 5,074,000 17,074,000 14,934,000 14,934,000 2,140,030 Average excess of imports 713,000 About ⅛of the whole imports , . These are according to official value , 867 which I prefer quoting , because the accounts are on the table : according to real value , the difference against Ireland was still greater . The reference made by the Committee to the evidence of Mr. Colville , a director of the bank of Ireland , who stated that `` in 1753 and 1754 , the Dublin exchange being remarkably unfavourable , and the notes of the Dublin Bank being suddenly withdrawn , the exchange became singularly favourable , '' is of little or no importance , because the circulation of notes at that time was confined to those of private bankers , there having been no chartered bank in Ireland till about the year 1782 . The Committee go on to say , `` In the spring of 1804 the exchange of England with the continent was above par , and the exchange of Ireland was in such a state , that 118l . 10s . of the notes of the Bank of Ireland would purchase only 100l . of the notes of the Bank of England . Therefore if the notes of the Bank of Ireland were not depreciated , and it was so maintained , it
