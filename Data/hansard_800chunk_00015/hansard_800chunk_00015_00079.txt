as fortunate if they did not receive active opposition from that quarter . Conscious ( as he was sure the present judges , and , above all , his noble and learned friend , who with so much advantage to the country presided at the King's-bench , must necessarily be ) of the rectitude of their own intentions , they must naturally be less aware than others of the evils of discretionary power ; fully determined not to abuse it , they were less likely to see the objection of the liability to abuse , which applies to all discretionary power whatever , and for this reason were little disposed to suggest , and seldom could be won to support , restraints on the exercise of authority . But such should not be the feelings of a legislature , such was not the duty of parliament ; and there the constitution had wisely , prudently , and , perhaps , for this very reason , placed the right of legislation , of regulation , of correction , instead of blindly surrendering the enactment of laws to those whose province it was to execute them . He did not , therefore , think that a member of that House was disqualified from offering an amendment in the laws , because he had pot been trained in the practice of them ; but he felt his own personal inability too 134 much to venture any extensive plan , and , indeed , he did not think that the occasion required it . He was not , therefore , about to propose any innovation in the principle of the law of libel ; that law was not , in his view , perfect and faultless ; but yet it might , and had been , administered without practical injustice ; and though in his utopia , the punishment of libel might form a very short chapter indeed , he did not think himself warranted on this , or any other occasion , in making the remedy larger and more extensive than the evil . At the same time he must observe , that , in discussing any subject connected with the liberty of the press and the law of libel , it was necessary to keep in view those great principles which distinguished the crime of libel from most other offences . In one respect it was like treason ; for treason and libel ( he meant throughout public state libels , for private slander was a different , and in his mind a much more heinous offence ) , were both crimes directly against the government , in which the public prosecutor , and even the magistracy itself , were more or less the parties aggrieved . The wise institution of juries , especially since the Libel Act , in some measure provided for this difficulty ; and in the cases of treason the merciful and enlightened law of this country had invented many fences against the hand of power , for the person accused . Yet , after all , the difficulty was more or less inherent in the nature of the thing ; it must and it ever would be the bias of men entrusted with power , to confound successful but lawful opposition with treasonable resistance , and a powerful exposure of the follies or wickedness of ministers and men in power , with seditious libels and calumny . The ingenuity of man could not devise a system of law where in cases of this nature , he would not say the prejudice , but the inclination of those who were to execute the laws , was not generally to convict men accused of having transgressed them ; and in libel it should further be observed , that contrary to all other crimes , that which approached the confines of guilt , was not only innocent , but meritorious and useful . Government could never feel an interest in proving a robbery on the roan who had not robbed , but it might feel an interest in convicting a political writer of a libel which he had never written
