circulating medium , '' it is said , `` so far from having increased in a ratio equal to that of these ' several enormous demands ' for its employment , bears an infinitely smaller proportion to those demands than it has done at former periods of our history . It can not therefore be in excess ; '' —This proposition 'has been ' much dwelt upon by many gentlemen who have spoken in this debate : 1122 and the difficulty of dealing with it lies in his—that on neither side of the comparison are what it assumes as data , fixed and certain ; that on the one side the total amount of the currency of the country , including paper of all kinds , is necessarily unknown ; and on the other side , who is there ( as I have before had occasion to ask ) that shall pretend to estimate with accuracy the aggregate amount of all the private transactions of the country ? The peremptory inference that excess is impossible , is surely not to be drawn with confidence from premises necessarily conjectural . In one sense , indeed , which , however , I can hardly suppose to be intended , it may be true that there never can be any such thing as excess , or superabundance of currency in a country : it can not be superabundant if you do not care for its depreciation . Suppose for instance ten millions sufficient to carry on all the transactions of the country—fabricate fifteen millions of paper instead of ten , the whole fifteen will circulate : —the only consequence will be , that the commodities for which it is exchanged will rise fifty per cent , in their nominal price . Make those fifteen millions twenty ; the addition will in like manner be absorbed into the enhanced prices of commodities . Excess of currency can not be proved to the conviction of those who will not admit depreciation to be the proof of it . But again , if we were to allow the accuracy and certainty of all the data that are assumed by those persons who have relied on this argument ; to allow whatever amount they please for the pecuniary transactions of the country , public and private ; to allow them to fix where they please , the amount of the currency ; and to assume that its actual amount at the present moment , consisting , as it does , almost exclusively of paper , is not greater—is even less—than when it consisted in part , and in great part , of gold ; —still it would remain for them , before they could infer the impossibility of excess , to show , that there was no improved mode of carrying on the transactions of the country , which facilitated and quickened all pecuniary transfers , arid made a less quantity of currency perform what had required a greater amount before ; it would remain , for them to show that the very substitution of paper for gold did not greatly contribute to this facility ; that a bank note of one hundred pounds would not perform 1123 in a given space of time an infinitely greater number of operations in exchange of commodities than an equal sum in the more bulky and Jess transferable shape of guineas . That these or any other arguments can disprove the possibility of excess , I utterly deny , —and I trust that the Bank has , by this time , ceased to believe . On the other hand , that the existence of excess can be proved by the converse of these arguments , or that any conclusive inference can be drawn from the positive amount of paper in circulation , or from the comparison of that amount , either with the amount , of currency in circulation at any former time , or with that of the pecuniary transactions , revenue and expenditure of the country , I do not pretend . The currency might be increased or diminished in any assignable degree , without affording any inference
