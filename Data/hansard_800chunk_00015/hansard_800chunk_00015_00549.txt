followed that the notes of the Bank of England were at more than 10l . per cent . premium above the standard coin of the two countries . '' I should have thought that reasons for this state of things in Ireland , might have occurred to the enlightened members of the Committee , unconnected with any issue of paper . 1st . The balance of trade , ( as has been shewn ) was much against Ireland . 2nd . The great increase of absentees at the time 3rd . The large sums remitted for security , during the disturbed state of things , by many of those who did not leave the country . 4th . Loans made in Ireland , held principally by English proprietors , ( to whom , of course , the interest was remitted here , ) which have , to a great extent , been since transferred to Ireland . With an increasing number of bank notes in Ireland , for the last two or three years the exchange has been progressively falling there , down to the date of my last account ( April , ) when it was 9¼l. , the par being 8⅓l . At Belfast , to the exchange at which place the Committee particularly refer ; the manufacturers having been accustomed to coin , would receive nothing else in payment ; but the purchasers of the bills were fully aware they would be paid in Bank of England notes , and therefore could not conceive these notes were depreciated . That Irish securities , however , are worth less than English is evident , 868 from the Irish 5l . per cent . stock , payable at the Bank of England , being usually 2l . or 3l . below English 5l . per cent . stock . The Committee , pursuing the subject of Irish exchanges , add , `` The principles laid down by the Committee of 1804 , had probably some weight with the directors of the bank of Ireland ; for , between the period of their report ( June 1804 ) and January 1806 , the circulation of the notes of the bank of Ireland was gradually ( though with small occasional fluctuations ) reduced , from about 3,000,000l . to 2,410,000l . being a diminution of nearly one-fifth , at the same time all the currency which had been issued under the name of silver tokens , was by law suppressed . '' This passage contains two most inconceivable mistakes , of which the proof is clear and positive , and was immediately before the Committee . I refer , for the first , to the account of Irish bank-notes called for by the House , and to an account of the exchange with Ireland . From which documents the following statement is made , demonstrating that instead of the increased issue of banknotes raising the exchange , that was the most favourable to Ireland when the amount of bank-notes was at the highest . Irish Bank Notes . Exchange Dublin on London . 1804 , January £.2,936,000 15½ January June 2,916,000 11 June 1805 , January 2,902,000 8½ June 2,813,000 11 1806 , January 2,465,000 11½ June 2,581,000 11 1807 , January 2,618,000 11 June 2,782,000 9¾ 1803 , January 2,732,000 9¾ June 2,894,000 10 1809 , January 3,141,000 8¾ June 3,101,000 9½ 1810 , January 3,192,000 8 June 3,165,000 8⅛ As a proof of the second mistake on the , part of the Committee , it will be sufficient to refer to the 44 Geo . 3 , cap . 71 , which proves that instead of the Irish silver tokens having been by law suppressed , as the Committee allege , they not only remained in currency , but it was made felony by that act to counterfeit them * . * The framer of the report seems to have confounded the small paper notes in Ireland with the tokens ; when the latter were legally put in circulation , the former became unnecessary . 869 As far as opinion can influence a judgment how far the amount of
