unfortunately broke through , and an irregular mode of payment substituted in their place . ; disorder of Course overran the trade , and an ill-directed parsimony on the part of the several manufacturing individuals accelerated , the mischief , and has at last completed the ruin irregularity had unhappily begun ; one manufacturer broke 1019 his price , and another followed his example , till contending with one another for the cheapest made goods , the conscientious employer , willing to let his workmen live by their industry , was at last forced also to reduce his prices , to secure himself a chance in the market ; and that to such an alarming extent has this erroneous scheme of reducing the weaver 's wages been carried , that the prices paid at present do not amount , in many instances , to more than one fourth , and on a fair average are not equal to one third of that paid for the same fabrics twenty-eight years ago ; so that , taking the advance on provisions , house and shop rent , and on the implements used by the weaver into the account , the price at present paid for weaving twenty-four yards of some fabrics will not procure more of these necessary articles than the price of three yards of the same fabrics would have procured at the above period , nor what four and a half yards would have paid for in 1792 : in this way have the operatives been reduced to poverty , and in place of their employers being benefited by their loss , unless in a few fortunate instances , it has contributed , perhaps more than any other circumstance , to the general bankruptcy , and the present low state of commercial credit ; nor was it possible it could do otherwise , every reduction of wages having a direct tendency to reduce the market , not merely for goods made at reduced prices , but also the value of the whole manufactured stock undisposed of , obliging the speculator who had overreached his capital to sell below prime cost to save his credit ; and that the present sweeping calamity , so rapid and destructive in its progress , and which the petitioners are convinced has been brought about , in no small degree , by this system of reduction though first felt by the Cotton Manufacturers and Weavers , has by no means been confined to their deportment of trade , the petitioners of every other profession depending in one way or other on the above branch , have all in their turn been involved , and are at present suffering a share of the general distress ; a very considerable number of the journey men house carpenters , cabinet makers , and tailors , are out of employment , while those engaged are generally limited in their working hours ; the blacksmiths , masons , and , others connected with buildings are also but partially employed even at reduced wages ; and the peti- 1020 tioners in general are one third of the whole , entirely destitute of work ; and that the petitioners are aware that some of the facts above stated may appear exaggerated , but , conscious that the most incredible circumstance can be attested by any number of witnesses , they are ready to substantiate them before a Committee of the House ; and praying the House to take the urgent case of the labouring : classes of that part of the kingdom into consideration , and devise such means for their relief as may appear best calculated to afford them employment , and wages . '' rose and spoke nearly as follows : Mr. Lushington ; Before I proceed to enter upon the subject , immediately before the Committee , I wish to deny the accuracy of the assertion of the noble lord ( Castlereagh ) , `` That the Committee whose Report is now under consideration had retroceded from their original opinion .
