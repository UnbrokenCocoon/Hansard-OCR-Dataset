by the government of England ; acting under the same misguided judgment , they once more called upon their commanders and their armies to try the experiment of an advance into the Spanish territories , to try how far we still were capable of undertaking a continental system of warfare.—We had not yet abandoned the vain idea of contending as principals in this contest.—The experiment was tried again , lord Wellington advanced , he met the enemy , he fought him , and he achieved ( what I shall always consider one of the most brilliant victories this country ever witnessed ) the victory of Talavera ; a victory gained under greater difficulties and with more desperate and infuriate fighting , than is recorded , I believe , in modern warfare . What was gained by this battle ? nothing but a loss . What was the result of this campaign which terminated with this battler The loss of all your sick and hospitals ; the loss of territory ; the loss of reputation ( not in your armies ) but in your political character ; the loss of that confidence which your allies had reposed in you , and which had been created , fostered , and encouraged , by your gallant commander ; and ( though last not least ) the loss by sickness , fatigue , and , I might almost add , famine , of nearly half your army.—Such was the consequence , such the lamentable , disastrous issue of your third campaign.—We now come to the last , which , although not terminated , is hanging , in some degree , suspended , and has changed from a system of attack to one of defence . It commenced by the position of your army on the frontiers of Portugal , re-established , and reinforced and re-organized by the zeal , the activity , the influence and exertions of my-gallant and noble friend lord Wellington . I consider this campaign as commencing from the moment Massena took the command of the French army ; at that moment we had collected one of the proudest British forces that had ever been assembled together ; a body of men amounting to not less than 35,000 effective troops , commanded by the ablest and most experienced generals that this country ever produced.—Let us see what has resulted from this campaign , which no sooner commenced than we found ourselves under the necessity of retreating , incapable 404 of contending against the superiority of numbers which were opposed to us.—Day after day beheld the loss of positions , of fortresses , of territories , which in one instance only was most gallantly and nobly checked by the army under lord Wellington at Buzaco , but which check only served as a respite for a few hours to the further advance of the enemy : and this campaign now leaves us , I will not say within our entrenchments , but incapable of quitting those entrenchments , and only waiting the result of such movements as the enemy may be disposed to make—It rests with him to chuse his day , to make his own disposition , to wait for his reinforcements ; it rests with him to say whether he will continue to blockade you , or whether he will give you a fair opportunity of contending with him in the field . If we are to judge by the publications in France , he will decide upon the former , and in this he will judge wisely.—Thus , Sir , have I terminated the history of the Spanish contest , bringing before your view as the result of all your victories , of all your expenditure in men and money , of all your exertions , and of all your waste of the military resources of this country , the position of your army at Lisbon , insulated and incapable of acting , but at the discretion of the enemy.—Your allies in every other part of the Peninsula overwhelmed , and only manifesting partial and unavailable hostility.—Your own resources exhausted , and your hopes of ultimate success , to
