difficulty , and need not be a work of time . But , in the interval , as it has been our policy , in conducting the war , to annoy the enemy abroad , rather than await his attack on our own shores , so let us preserve that system of currency which enables us to confine his violence to the continent , and to deny to him the power of interfering with , or shaking this most vital branch of a system , under which we flourish as a nation and through the fruits of which we 1011 contend on behalf of the world as well as ourselves . denied that be had retroceded , or that the Committee had altered their opinion ; and maintained , that instead of bringing forward abstract propositions , he had laid before the ( louse practical measures for them to adopt , replied , that the propositions were indefinite in their nature , and therefore unfair towards the Bank of England . rose principally for the purpose of answering a challenge from his right hon . friend , `` who had commenced the discussion that night .
