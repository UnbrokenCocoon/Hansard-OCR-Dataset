their good intentions effectual , by 351 giving them a legislative sanction , at the same time to secure the soldiers from the recurrence of abuses , in consequence of the temporary authority of all regulations in the shape of general orders . He was sure the House could not seriously intend to constitute the refusal of the Catholic soldier , to frequent the service of the Protestant church , a crime—yet , in point of fact , it was in the habit of doing so annually on passing the Mutiny Bill ; and also , of providing penalties against those who Were guilty of it . By the Mutiny Bill , the King is empowered to make articles of war for the government of the army . By the first of these articles , all officers and soldiers , not having just impediment , shall diligently frequent divine service , and sermon , in the places appointed for the assembling of the regiment , troop or company , to which they belong such as wilfully absent themselves shall , for the first offence , forfeit one shilling ; and for the second offence one shilling , and be laid in irons for twelve hours.—By the same articles , section 2 , article 5 , if a soldier shall disobey any lawful command of his superior officer , he shall suffer death , or such other punishment as by a general court-martial shall be awarded ; and as the refusal to frequent divine service is such a disobedience , it is possible that the punishment of death might be inflicted on the offender.—As , said Mr. Parnell , the House could never mean to create this a crime , in the case of a Catholic soldier , it could never desire to continue by law punishments like these . It was therefore the object of the clause which he should subunit to its consideration , to provide that no person professing the Roman Catholic religion serving in his Majesty 's regular forces , or in the militia of the united kingdom , should be subjected by the articles of war to any punishment for not frequenting divine service as performed according to the rites and ceremonies of the established church . He would now state to the House such cases as would shew to it that the interposition of the legislature had become necessary . In the course of last summer , a soldier of the name of Spence , belonging to the county of Dublin militia , having refused to attend the Protestant worship , was put into confinement ; having in consequence sent a memorial complaining of this treatment to his commanding officer , he was brought to a court-martial on the alleged offence of presenting an improper memorial . He 352 was sentenced to receive 500 lashes , which punishment was commuted for service in the West Indies—and he had actually been taken as far as the Isle of Wight , when upon an application of Dr . Troy and some other respectable Catholics , an order was given for his being brought back . Another instance happened at Enniskillen—several privates of the artillery corps having refused to go to the Protestant church , their commanding officer made them parade with their coats turned , and continued this punishment till an application was made to the commander of the forces , and an order obtained to desire him to desist—In consequence of these occurrences , the commander of the forces issued general orders in January last , stating , `` That reports having been circulated , that Catholic soldiers have been prevented from attending divine worship according to the tenets of their religion , and obliged , in certain instances , to be present at that of the established church , the commanding officers of the several regiments are to be attentive to the prevention of such practices , if they have in any instance existed in the troops under their command , as they are in violation of the orders contained in the circular letter of the 14th May , 1806 , and since repented to
