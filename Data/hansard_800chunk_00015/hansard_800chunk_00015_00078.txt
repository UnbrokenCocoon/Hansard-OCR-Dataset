not feel his knowledge of the laws sufficient to justify him in attempting to do all which , according to his imperfect and perhaps theoretical view of the subject , he should think desirable to be done . Indeed , limited as was the object of his motion , and even the measures he meant to build on it , it might well be asked how and why he , who had neither learning nor professional habits to give his opinion authority , should venture to descend into a field which was so much better adapted for the display of those qualities , for which so many noble and learned lords in the House Were eminently distinguished . He would speak fairly on this subject , he would own that if , on a review of our history , he had found that all or even a large portion of the laws which had improved our constitution , which had vindicated the lights of the people , and which had purified the administration of justice , had originated from persons of that profession , or from individuals dignified with the honours of their profession , he should have felt abashed in coming forward on such subjects ; but the records of our legislature proved , that our ancestors , though not in the profession of the law , had not hesitated to correct the abuses which had crept into it , and with few exceptions , that the most eminent magistrates had seldom been forward in supporting , much less suggesting , those measures , which , when adopted , had become the theme of universal praise , and the most perfect models of our legislative wisdom . Without going back to ship-money , dispensing power , and the opinion of the judges thereupon , he would confine himself strictly to such as were in parimateri√¢ with those which affected the liberty of the press . He had not , for instance , heard that , in the controversy in which Milton drew his formidable pen , the lawyers had particularly distinguished themselves against the practice of licensing books previous to publication . He did not find when the law by which that practice prevailed , first expired in Charles 2d 's time , that it was the suggestion of the judges which occasioned its expiration . He could not learn what were the efforts made against it by the luminaries of the law , when it was revived under James the 2d . He thought he recollected that , at the final expiration of that pernicious and degrading custom in William 3d 's time , the press did not receive the warmest support , nay , that if 133 did not escape some degree of opposition from those to whom the execution of the laws was intrusted . Certain he was that in latter times , the great and important victory obtained over corrupt usage and bad law , by an act , which he reverenced , not less for its enactments than for its author , to which his learned friend near him had so eminently contributed , and which was commonly known by a name which was sufficient to revive in his mind the strongest emotions of veneration and gratitude ; certain he was , that that great act , which restored juries to their rights , and rescued the press from servitude and oppression , was carried through that House , not at the instigation , but in direct defiance of those who at that time presided in our courts of justice , and who had recorded on their lordships ' Journals , their opinion against a measure which , in its effects , as in its principles , was acknowledged to be among the most beneficial laws that , in modern times , had received the sanction of the legislature . Indeed , if he were disposed to dwell on so invidious a theme , he thought that , from the very nature of their stations , he could deduce reasons why such laws scarcely ever originated with the bench , and might be considered
