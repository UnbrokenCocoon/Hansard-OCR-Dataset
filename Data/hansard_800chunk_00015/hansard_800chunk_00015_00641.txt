to the circulating medium , from its scarcity , counterbalancing the extraordinary demand for gold to send abroad ; but the effect must be , that the nation , for all practical purposes , would be left without an adequate circulating medium ; the Bank would suffer in a comparatively small degree ; but the nation must be ruined . To assert , then , that notes have fallen in value , because they have not risen with the precious metals , or that they have fallen , compared with the currency of other countries , because they are not convertible at this moment , without loss , into them , docs appear to me to be a most inaccurate state of the question , founded on a total misrepresentation of the first principles of our paper currency . As a corollary from which error , the Committee have deduced the principle , that the exchange between any two countries never can exceed the expence of transporting the precious metals from one to the other ; a fact disproved in daily practice , and proceeding upon the strange assumption , that the quantity of bullion to be procured within any country is unlimited . It is true , a person who possesses a pound of gold in one country , may command a pound of gold in any other , at the utmost , for the cost of transporting his own gold there : but the person who has no gold of his own , must , in addition to the expence of transport , first buy the pound of gold at whatever price the quantity in the market , compared with the demand , may impose ; and then the expence to him of the exchange will be the increased price of the 1007 gold added to the expence of transport . In truth , the fallacy is not less evident in the former case , as the expense , to the person who possesses the gold , is what the gold is actually worth if sold , and which he sacrifices when he sends it abroad . It appears then altogether unfounded , to assert that Bank notes are depreciated ; and , if I were obliged , between two propositions , both of which I disapprove , to vote for one , I should infinitely prefer passing an act to require the Bank to resume its cash payments at the end of two years , rather than gratuitously , and without proof of the fact or any real remedy in view , vote that the notes of the Bank of England are depreciated . The effect of the former vote I might repeal before it came into operation ; the consequences of the latter I could never recall . What could induce the Committee so to express themselves , is to me matter of surprise and astonishment . ; they have done so in direct contradiction to the evidence of every witness they examined , even of sir F. Baring and the continental merchant , the witnesses on whom they principally rely , who expressly testify against them on this material point . Sir F Baring , an authority entitled to the highest respect , declares in terms , `` that he does not consider Banknotes to be depreciated ; '' and the Continental Merchant says `` that Bank notes may not represent what is expressed upon the face of them , but something in fact equally real , though not applicable to equalize the balance of trade ; '' and he further goes on to describe , what he thus chooses to call depreciation , `` as originating not in the excessive issues of the Bank , but in the enemy 's measures , and its not having recovered , to the paper not being exchangeable for cash . '' Certainly , so long as cash could be procured upon demand and exported , the exchange and price of gold could never rise ; but where is the gold to come from , to equalize this account when our extraordinary expenditure in the two last years
