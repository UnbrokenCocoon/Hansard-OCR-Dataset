number of executions for debt ascended to 80,000 , and amounted to 22Â½ millions sterling . He left gentlemen to consider how far this might with propriety be called in a national sense a ruinous concern , and that therefore a general policy was against it , and to reflect on the propriety of making these public sacrifices to the private interests of these few book-keepers and individuals who benefit by the system . It was said , there was nothing new to be advanced upon this subject ; that he denied . There was much that was new to be said , but it was not necessary for him to say it at present ; but he hoped the house , in some future stage of this business , would be perfectly acquainted with all that was to be found in the papers now before it , and that would give them a proper idea of the slave trade , as it related to the condition of the bulk of the West India negroes . He had never considered it on that ground , because he did not think the case rested on that point , and he had abstained from the discussion of that topic , because he knew it was likely to produce irritation , and make parties in the house acrimonious against each other ; but what he said was this , that the general state of the negroes in the West Indies would never be materially improved , if the African importation was permitted to continue ; they would always be in a state of degradation , below that which ought to be the lot of the human species ; they were like cattle , under the whip , in which improvement was impossible , nothing being applied to them but brutal 672 force , they could never possess any but brutal manners , so they must always , under such a system , remain , degraded in the estimation of others , and their own , receiving no moral instruction or improvement from the society in which they lived , or rather from which they were excluded ; this prevented them from endeavouring to improve themselves , or their condition . He had endeavoured on various former occasions to impress upon the house the advantages likely to result from changing this system , by shewing that the abolition of the slave trade from the coast of Africa would have many very beneficial effects . It would make it the obvious interest of the master that the slave should be kept with as much care as possible , because his place could not be supplied ; that after this , means would of course be adopted to take care of the health of every negro , and also of his moral improvement ; encouragement would be given to marriage , and other legitimate objects would be pursued , by which they would become populous , industrious , intelligent , moral , and happy ; by which we should have a powerful , though laborious and obedient peasantry ; instead of a degraded race of beings , actuated only by a brutal impulse ; but the house might believe him , they were capable of much improvement ; it was dangerous to keep them in this state long ; they were capable of reflecting on their physical , powers ; they might be brought to feel how they might be able to destroy those who made or kept them captive . They might become possessed of that knowledge . There was reason to apprehend , that they would form plans , and devise means for carrying them into execution . They could see a distant object with clearness and pursue the means of arriving at it with vigour , and at the same time with patience . He would have gentlemen , who wished to continue this trade , reflect upon these matters , and take care they did not mistake the matter ; for these negroes may reflect on their own situation long enough before they have in their own hands the remedy for their
