less than 70 printed pages . Every exertion was used to get the papers ready for presentation that day , but it was found impracticable ; and it was wished the house should meet to-morrow , for the purpose of laying the papers on the table with the earliest possible opportunity . With respect to the blame which the noble earl seemed to impute to him , for his conduct on the occasion , he must say , he thought no blame could fairly be imputed to him , either for what he had done in the first instance , or in the subsequent proceedings . He had certainly , according to what he had professed , laid every information before the house , which he thought necessary , for the due understanding of the subject . He had professed his anxious wish to have the subject fully and completely before parliament and the public , and on that principle he acted . The idea of producing additional information , it should be recollected , did not originate with him ; it was deemed , upon maturer consideration of the topics , to be necessary by other persons , and in other quarters . In conformity , therefore , with the wish to have every degree of information which might be deemed necessary before parliament and the public , it was , that he had proposed the production of the additional documents ; and this with as little delay as possible : in which view , and with reference to an early discussion of , and decision upon , the subject , it was proposed to meet to-morrow .

Did a line of proceeding , obviously intended to enable that house to discuss and decide upon the subject , on at least as early a day as the other house , argue a wish to make their lordships the servile imitators and followers of that house ? Certainly not . So much for the assertion of the noble earl on that head , and the wish to meet to-morrow being in strict conformity to every principle laid down by his majesty 's ministers in that house for their conduct ; with respect to the subject in question , he did not see how any noble lord could consistently object to the proceeding . said , he did not , nor could he ever have intended to complain , that too much information had been afforded . He would say , however , that it was the duty of ministers to have known what papers were requisite for the discussion of the question ; and that they should have come prepared with them in the first instance.â€”Adjowned . rose and said , that he stated on a former day , his intention of submitting to the house , this day , the manner in which he would proceed upon this subject .
