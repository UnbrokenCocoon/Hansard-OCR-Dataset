with a very large proportion of new levies , but ; the greater number of them were inured to the service in battalion , more than ever was the case at any former period in the history of the forces of this country . Of this army , 80,000 were in the plantations , and in the colonies about 56,000 , which was the whole of our foreign service at present , except the German Legion ; and in G. Britain and Ireland there was a disposable force of about 80,000 ; but he was perfectly ready to admit that the Whole of that force was not disposable . He observed that the whole of this force could not be sent abroad , for that , besides militia , there must be a certain number of the regular force kept in this country , instead of depending upon the militia ; but this was a matter dependent upon circumstances , for if any great attack were made upon the enemy on the continent , that would be a diversion of the power of the enemy , and render his attempt at a descent upon Us the less probable ; and in proportion to that , our regular force at home would become disposable which was at present not so ; and here he must be allowed to repeat , that estimating the Character of the army of this country at former periods as highly as any noble lord pleased , still be was ready to maintain , that we had a larger and a better disposable army at this moment than this country ever had at any former period whatever . He would admit , however , that 812 taking the whole of our force together , our limited force was too great , and our unlimited force too little , but that to make a larger , portion disposable would not leave us without sufficient defence ; all he wanted to impress , upon their lordships in , this case was that we had now a larger and a better disposable force than we ever had at any former period . But it had been stated there was a great deficiency in our establishment , and the ground was , that there was a deficiency in some of the regiments , and therefore , it was argued , there was a deficiency in our force ; this was a fallacious mode of reasoning ; because we had a greater number of regiments than were necessary with reference to the whole number of men we wanted ; but the only successful way to raise them , was to have them spread as widely as possible , and hence arose the number of regiments , and although some of them were incomplete , it by no means from thence followed that the establishment was deficient ; and this distinction was lost sight of when noble lords declaimed against government for having an army on paper only ; but the question was not whether we had hot some regiments which were defective , but what was the real amount of our establishment , and this was to be judged of by circumstances , and a reference was to be had to the force of the , enemy likely to operate against us . Why then , if he had clearly established the facts , that we had a larger military establishment of every description than any other country upon earth ; a larger army much in proportion to our population , than our enemy had he would ask , what was the ground for calling on that house to institute an investigation which would be productive of no advantage , but which might produce great evils , at all events great hazard , for it would introduce any project with any individual might chuse to propose . A course of proceeding , which he ; Would take leave to remind their lordships , was always reprobated by the best informed persons , as a dangerous practice in parliament . He knew that the army was under the superintending care of parliament ,
