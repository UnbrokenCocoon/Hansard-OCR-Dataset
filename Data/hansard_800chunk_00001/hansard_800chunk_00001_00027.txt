to such a motion , he would now give notice , that it was his intention in a few days , to move , That there be laid before the house , an account of the number of men raised through the operation of the said act . That motion he should follow up with another , respecting the operation of the same measure with regard to Ireland . The noble lord was desirous to make the motions separately ; because , 46 with regard to Ireland , at least it would appear , that the provisions of that bill were net only inadequate for the defence of that country , but proved moreover , an onerous and oppressive tax on that part of the united kingdom , and fat beyond that proportion which by the articles of the union , it was bound to bear . did not conceive there would be any objection to the motion ; the noble lord might make it now , if he thought proper , nor was it necessary , in his opinion , to make separate motions on the same subject respecting the two countries . acquiesced in part of the noble secretary 's suggestion , but persisted in dividing the two motions . His lordship then moved `` that an humble address be presented to his majesty , praying that his majesty would be graciously pleased to give directions , that there be laid before the house an account of the number of men raised in pursuance of the additional force bill . '' This motion was agreed to , as also a similar one with regard to Ireland . presented again the three petitions against Judge Fox , which were submitted to the house last session ; namely , one from Mr. Hart , one from the Grand Jury of the county of Fermanagh , and one from the High Sheriff of the same county , which were severally read , and ordered to lie on the table . His lordship then presented the heads of the charges made against justice Fox , and concluded by moving , that the house should resolve itself into a committee on Thursday next , to consider the said papers . observed , that the business before the house was one of the most important that could come under their lordship 's deliberation . It was therefore of the greatest importance that they should consider well what mode of proceeding ought to be adopted . By the act of the 1st of his present majesty , by which it was enacted that the commissions of the judges should not be terminated by the demise of the crown , it was proved that a judge might be removed upon an address to his majesty from both houses of Parliament , praying for such removal . The question , therefore , in this case , must ultimately be , whether the facts alledged against Mr. Justice Fox were such as to-call upon their lordships to concur in as 47 address for his removal . An important question , however , arose as to the mode of proceeding , in the first instance , and it would probably become a subject for their lordships deliberation on Thursday next , whether they should call upon Judge Fox to answer to the facts as alledged by the noble marquis , or whether they ought not first to proceed some length in the investigation of those alledged facts , in order to ascertain if such a case was made out as entitled them to call upon that judge to defend himself . This was a subject of the Utmost importance , and demanded grave and serious consideration . He was happy that this was the only instance that had hitherto occurred since the passing of the bill alluded to of the conduct of a judge becoming the subject of a discussion like the present , and it was certainly incumbent upon the house to determine as to the mode of proceeding with the greatest caution and deliberation.â€”The motion of the noble marquis was then agreed to ; and their lordships
