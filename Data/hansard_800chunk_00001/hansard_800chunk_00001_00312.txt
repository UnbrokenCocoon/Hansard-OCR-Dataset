he must not forget to acknowledge that the Report he alluded to by no means admits these premises , but on the contrary , contends that the situation of a slave in the West Indies is more fortunate than that of a Hindoo labourer in Bengal . And in support of this position , the writer , giving a statement of the earnings or wages of the Hindoo , the errors of which it were immaterial to point out , proceeds to describe the poor Hindoo 's meal of rice and salt , `` his miserable hovel , formed of materials which a wealthier class would refuse for fuel ; a coarse mat his bed ; the ground both his chair and table ; unglazed earthen pots his furniture ; a leaf his plate ; his clothing ( what the writer terms ) a carf on the shoulder , and another on the waist , with sandals on the feet ; a rugged home-made blanket , to protect him from the wet or cold , the only variation known to the peasant . '' After finishing this statement , the report triumphantly exclaims , such is the situation of 20 millions of free subjects of the British empire in India , whilst its legislature is Hunting for imaginary misery in the West 666 India colonies , where the lot of the labourer is a thousand times more fortunate The Report then proceeds to demonstrate that the herrings and salt fish allowed the slave cost more than the whole sustenance of the Bengal peasant ; and this is the sole proof adduced of the thousand times more fortunate lot of the slave ! The other luxuries he enjoys , in addition to his herrings and salt fish , are not enumerated Of his advantages over the Hindoo in respect to habitation , furniture , and clothing , we are also left to conjecture ; In truth , the writer of this report , in this part of it at least , has proved himself to be but little acquainted with the subject on which he treats ; for had he been at all conversant with the nature and character of the Hindoo and the Hindoo laws and system , he would have known that his simple and abstemious diet ( which however is more varied than this statement admits ) is both adapted to his nature , and enjoined him by his religion ; that his habitation and cloathing are in fact suited to the climate ; that his means , limited as they are , are not more limited than his desires . Some indeed of the stated points of hardship in the lot of the Hindoo peasant are common also to the Hindoo prince ; and much of what the report describes as hardship and oppression in the lot of the Hindoo peasant is to him content and comfort . But it must have struck the house , that in this comparison of the lot of the Hindoo peasant with that of the , African slave , there is one not immaterial omission . Here he alluded to a difference in their respective lots , which it required a better pencil than his to delineate ; he alluded to mental feeling . Here the humble Hindoo peasant , in his miserable hovel , has sources of pride and happiness , tat which not only the slave , but even his master , is a stranger : he is , it is true , a , peasant , and his labour and industry are devoted to an European lord ; but in another view he is , in his own sincere belief , more than his lord 's superior , for he conceives of him as of the very lowest casino earthly consideration would prevail on him to eat from the same plate ; and he would not suffer his son to marry the daughter of his master , even if she could bring him the West Indies for her portion . The Hindoo peasant drinks of his native wells , and however scanty his meal , he receives it
