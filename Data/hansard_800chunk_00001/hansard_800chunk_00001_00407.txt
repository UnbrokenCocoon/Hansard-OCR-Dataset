though there might be an appearance of advantage in many points of view , there were so many of a , contrary , tendency which presented themselves , at the same time , that he thought it would be better and safer to adhere to the mode which our excellent constitution had pointed out . His lordship declared himself averse to the system of innovation , which this motion was calculated to produce , and thought it wise to abide by that system which we knew , and of which we had felt the happy effect , by which the British army had been the glory of its country the terror of its foes , and the admiration of the world . He had gone through all the different statements of the noble lords who supported , the motion ; he had endeavoured to prove there was no power equal to us upon earth in force , and that the discipline of that force was better than at any former period ; he had proved that there was no specific ground for this motion , and that if any noble lord thought , his majesty 's ministers had neglected their duty , the regular way was to move an address to his majesty to remove them .
