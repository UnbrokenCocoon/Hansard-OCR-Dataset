gent , would have been inclined to treat the proposition as serious . If there was any thing like a contrary disposition on the part of ministers not to manifest a readiness to do every thing in their power for the national defence , or if there was any thing imminently dangerous in our situation , that called for the committee moved for by his right hon . 621 friend , then , indeed , there would be some I which we at present stood , and compared ground for acceding to it : but the case it with that of last year , to refrain from was quite otherwise . Perhaps it might be for the satisfaction of the house to slate a view of the whole military force of the country . The total of disposable force on the 1st of Jan. 1804 , was 143,251 ; on the 1st of Jan. 1805 , 154,660 ; the whole of our limited force on the former date , 27,890 , on the latter , 20,747 . Deducting the limited force , which was included in the former aggregates , the whole of the disposable force was , on the 1st of Jan. 1804 , 115,000 ; on the 1st of Jan. 1805 , 135,000 , making an increase of disposable force of from 18,000 to 20,000 men . The quantity I procured by recruiting was from 24 to 26,000 ; and 15,000 since the operation of the present bill . The total of between 11 and 12,000 increase , is not only in the unlimited force , but in the destination of the army at home . This circumstance was sufficient shew the bill had not been idle and nugatory . Thus , 12,000 men were now ready to be ordered in any direction , in addition to the force provided ; besides this , we had the essential improvement in the volunteers , which he could not agree to consider unconnected with the question on the extent of the military power of the country : their number now ascended to 300,000 men , who have stood the test of time , who have resisted the temptations to ease and indolence ; and 160,000 of this vast body have been reported fit for service . He did not mean they were adequate to contend with the troops of Prussia or Austria , but that they were competent to the defence of such districts of the island as should be committed to their protection . Could we with such a force have any room for the gloomy representations frequently made ? Could more be expected from the nature and extent of the population of the country ? If we wish for a criterion by which to estimate the military force of the country , let us look to the state of the different powers on the continent , let us look particularly to France , which , with a population of 35 millions , had an army not exceeding at any time 5 or 600,000 men , while in G. Britain , which contained but 15 millions , the regular force amounted to three hundred thousand men , besides those to v whom the domestic defence was entrusted , as also 70,000 militia , and 300,000 volunteers . It was impossible for any men who fairly examined the situation in 622 which we at present stood , and compared it with that at last year , to refrain from allowing that it was greatly improved . Could such a man be found , he would ask him , was it nothing to have added , as we had clone , to the strength of those fleets whose peculiar province it was to protect us from the execution of the menaces of the invader ? Was it nothing to have succeeded so completely in the blockade of the enemy 's flotilla , that instead of venturing on the ocean to attack us , it was with difficulty that it could be slily moved along the coast from one part to another ? What would the enemy have said , had we
