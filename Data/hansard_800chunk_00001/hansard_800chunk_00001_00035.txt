advice of the aforesaid deputy under-sheriff , and one of the under-sheriffs , who were then and there present during the whole course of such argument , the other under-sheriff not being on the said 13th day in attendance ) uniformly admit such of them to vote as stated themselves upon oath to have been 12 months in possession of shares of the value of 40s . a year , and did as uniformly reject such of them as appeared not to have been 12 months in possession , or not to have shares of that annual value , the petitioners acting therein in conformity to the advice aforesaid , and that the petitioners admitted the said last-mentioned persons to vote , from , a full and perfect conviction at the time of the legality of their claim , established in the minds of the petitioners by the repeated arguments of counsel , and the solemn oath of the parties ; and they do conscientiously and sacredly declare , that , in the admission of those , as well as all other voters during the whole continuance of the aforesaid election , they acted with the most pure and upright intention , without partiality to one candidate , or prejudice against the other ; and that the petitioners humbly state , that , though in particular instances they did heap questions argued by counsel , yet they did not consider themselves invested with a judicial authority , for the petitioners were instructed to conceive , and did and do . still conceive , that any freeholder , who tenders himself to take the respective oaths required by divers acts of parliament , to be taken at a county election , is entitled to have such oaths administered to him , and to vote thereat , and that such persons would be rejected at the peril of an action for damages , to be brought against the returning officers so rejecting them ; nevertheless the petitioners confess that , in divers instances , they did take such peril upon themselves when the justice and equity of the case seemed , to warrant them in so proceeding , though not compellable by law so to do ; and , in order to satisfy and protect themselves in the execution of this part of their office , they were frequently willing and de- 137 sirous to hear the arguments of counsel as a guide and assistance to the conduct of the petitioners , but not as a right to be claimed by either candidate ; and that the petitioners further state , that they , in divers instances , as well relating to other tenements as to the mill tenement aforesaid , when it appeared to them , by the confession of the parties claiming a right to vote , that they had not been in possession of their freehold for 12 months , or that it was not of the annual value of 40s . did reject such persons ; and the petitioners submit to this house that , from the aforesaid causes , they may seem sometimes to have acted ministerially , and at other times judicially , but at no time did they act from any interested or unworthy motives , but , on the contrary , from an anxious and earnest desire to do justice to all parties , though at the peril of an action against themselves ; and the petitioners pursued this line of conduct equally in respect to voters tendering their votes for the aforesaid W.
