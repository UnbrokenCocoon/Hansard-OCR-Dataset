possibly might afterwards Come before them as judges ; and he contended , that , on the score of expedition , the line of conduct recommended by his noble friend was by far the most preferable . quitted the woolsack , and directed his observations chiefly to the situation in which the question stood and the most eligible mode of proceeding In point of form ; he declined delivering his sentiments upon the subject till a future opportunity , but he seemed to prefer proceeding with the investigation , as the house had already determined . There was one point which had transpired in the course of that evening 's discussion which he was happy to observe , and for which he had to express his thanks to noble lords ; nay , even his gratitude ; namely , the apparent disposition to act upon the opportunities which the constitution afforded them , of having recourse to the assistance , when necessary , of the law lords , and to render their attendance effectual . spoke in explanation , and expressed his astonishment at the way in which the noble secretary of state seemed to consider what had fallen from him . He thought his conduct , on the occasion , required no apology ; it was the bounden duty of every member of that house to come forward and otter his opinion , in every stage of a business , and on every opportunity , as to what he thought might ' best favour the ends of public justice .
