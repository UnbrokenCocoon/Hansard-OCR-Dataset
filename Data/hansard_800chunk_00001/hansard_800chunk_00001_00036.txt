of the duties , and power of a returning officer at an election of a knight to represent a county in parliament , that they shall not incur the censure of the house if , in the execution of their office , they sometimes appear to have been misled by contradictory arguments , which in the case of Ashby and White divided the opinions of the court of king 's bench , where Lord Holt at that time presided as chief justice ; and that those persons who , on the 15th day , claimed a right to vote for the mill tenement were rejected , because it appeared from their own confession , when the oath was tendered to them , that they had not been possessed of their freehold for the space of 12 months before the election , whereas those who were admitted on the 13th and 14th days , took the freeholder 's oath , of the nature and effect of which they were solemnly warned and instructed at the time ; and that the votes of the description above- 138 mentioned were not rejected on the 15th day , because sir . F. Burdett had then secured a majority of numbers on the poll , for the petitioners humbly state , that many of that description were rejected both in the early and latter part of that day , as well before as after such majority appears to have been obtained ; and that the petitioners are informed that , at the election in July last of a knight of the shire in the room of sir F. Burdett , several of the proprietors of the said mill , called the Good Intent , tendered their votes , and that by the advice of Newman Knowlys , esq . barrister at law , and common serjeant of the city of London , who was assessor to the then sheriff , the then sheriff did not consider such proprietors to be fictitious voters , but did , after various arguments on each side , admit such of the said mill proprietors to poll who stated themselves upon oath to have been in possession 12 months of shares of the value of 40s . a year , and rejected others who had not been for that length of time in possession of such shares , or whose shares were not of that annual value , pursuing therein the same rule and line of conduct that the petitioners had adopted in the former election ; and that the petitioners , with all humility , submit themselves to the sentence of the house , assured as they are that in its wisdom and its justice it will consider the arduous duty imposed on the petitioners as returning officers at the aforesaid election ; and that no evidence whatever was , or has been , or could have been adduced , to shew any interested motive , personal or political , by which the petitioners were influenced in their conduct , and the petitioners solemnly declare , and are ready , if they might be permitted , to attest the same on oath , that , throughout the whole of such conduct , they never did in a single instance willfully transgress the line of their duty , but uniformly acted to the best of their knowledge , and that without favour or affection , prejudice or malice , towards any , person or party ; and that the petitioners most humbly state to the house , that whatever may have appeared blameable in the execution of their office has arisen from the difficulty and novelty of their situation , and from their general ignorance of the law , which , however , they most anxiously endeavoured to correct ( but are sorry to have found how unsuccessfully ) by acting under the immediate judgment of professional persons , of great character and long ex- 139 perience ; and that the petitioners are in formed , that the said report of the said select committee is ordered by the house to be taken into consideration on Tuesday , the 29th
