attention ought to be directed to the general statements of your military force . And here it strikes one , at the very outset , that it is asserted by some gentlemen , that even a failure on the part of the present administration in their performances , is very different from a failure on the part of the late ministers . It is nothing like so bad and so dangerous , because , say they , our force is upon the whole so considerably increased ; and the right hon . gent , himself seemed , when the subject was first mentioned , to pant after the time when he might have the opportunity of shewing it . My right hon . friend 730 opposite ( Mr. Canning ) says , that our navy has been augmented by the number of no less than 50 ships of war . Sir , I deny it . We have not one more effective ship of war , nor an atom more of actual efficient naval force , than we had under the last naval administration . But it would appear that there is something so very peculiar in the composition of the present administration , as to challenge and to command such an especial and unbounded degree of confidence , that no man shall presume to say that any thing in the shape of enquiry is at all necessary . On the subject of their superior claims to the confidence of this house and the public , I shall say a little more by and bye . I must , however observe , that the change , as it respects a claim for confidence , has , indeed , altered circumstances , but has altered them very much for the worse . I shall now shew from a short review of the returns on the table , what the exertions of the right hon . gent . have produced for the army , and how the country has reason to feel from the change which placed the right hon . gent . in power . In Jan. 1804 the whole of our army amounted to 191,099 In Jan. 1805 the whole of our army amounted to 143,651 Deficiency 41,448 In Jan. 1804 the Militia 109,947 In Jan. 1805 the Militia 85,519 Deficiency 24,428 Total of army and militia in Jan. 1804 301,046 Total of army and militia in Jan. 1805 229,170 Deficiency 71,876 The Cavalry in Jan. 1804 11,177 The Cavalry in Jan. 1805 21,223 Increase 4,046 The Artillery in Jan. 1804 7,661 The Artillery in Jan. 1805 8,517 Increase 856 The Foreign Troops in 1804 13,710 The Foreign Troops in 1805 21,028 Increase 7,318 From the documents altogether , there results an augmentation of the whole body of the army of only 11,000 men , making the whole difference between the returns of force of the two years , and consequently the sum of the efforts of the present administration . But you are to consider , that of the increase , 7000 men are in the 731 foreign corps , and 4000 in the cavalry . We find , however , that in the British infantry , there is a deficiency of 856 men . Surely the Ceylon , troops are not in fairness to be reckoned . Indeed , augmentation in that quarter can not justly be taken into the account for ministers , since , with the increase of distant territories , it becomes a matter of necessity to increase the troops . To call this an actual extension of your disposable force , is a downright fallacy . But what we do find , sir , is this ; that there is a positive decrease in that particular branch of the military force , which it was the peculiar and boasted object of this bill to increase . To what was this bill particularly to apply ? Was it to the raising of troops at Ceylon ? Was it to Black Corps ? Was it to an addition of German Legions ? No ! it was to augment greatly the numbers of the British infantry .
