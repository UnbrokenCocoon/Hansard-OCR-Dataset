He agreed in the propriety of having corps of black troops in our service in our Colonial possessions , but when it was proposed to abolish the slave trade altogether , such a measure was certainly inconsistent with the object of the abolition , He would now ask if the result of the abolition ( supposing it to be carried , which he hoped it would not ) should be such as had been predicted by those best informed upon the subject , namely , nothing less than the abolition of our colonial system , should we in that case be so 644 well able to cope with our enemies , bereft of the vast resources which we derived from our colonies , and would not every man in the country , and every member of that house , be called upon to pay his share of this large deficiency , which such a defalcation would cause ? Let the house consider the number of men who were employed in consequence of this trade , and the benefits which resulted from it to our manufactures . Besides , how could those who formed an opinion here upon the subject be better judges than the planters themselves ? But it was said that some of the planters agreed to the propriety of the abolition . This might be the case , but it should be recollected , that the abolition would throw the property and concerns of our colonies into the hands of those who had large capitals , for such only could support it ; and therefore the concurrence of some of those was rather an argument against the abolition . But , whatever might be the opinion of a few of the planters , the house of Assembly of Jamaica , the Representatives of the Island had declared themselves decidedly adverse to the measure of the abolition . Much had been said of the danger of increasing the number of slaves ; when that number was compared with the number of Europeans , it certainly appeared very great , and there was no question that if they were united , no military force could put them down , as they might reckon upon the proportion of about thirty negroes to one European . How impolitic , then , was it to raise doubts and questions in their minds upon the subject of emancipation , for to that this question ultimately led , and how pregnant with danger was such conduct to our colonial interests and possessions , particularly at the present moment , when , from the circumstances of a neighbouring island , the Negroes had not only greater inclination to unite , but possessed greater facilities of co-operation . Under these circumstances , it became the house to say at once to the world , that they were resolved not to adopt a system which could only lead to the most injurious consequences , and thus to put an end to discussions which had already , and which evidently must have the very worst effect upon the minds of the negroes . He had some objections to the provisions of the bill , which he should reserve until it went into the committee ; at present he should confine himself to objecting to the 645 principles of the bill , and he was confident that there were many members who formerly voted for the abolition , who would now , under the circumstances in which we were placed , vote against the present bill ; he should therefore take the sense of the house upon the subject , lie concluded by moving `` that the bill be read a second time this day six months . '' said , if the abolition of the slave trade was rendered general by the consent of all those powers who had colonial possessions , he did not know that our colonies would suffer so much as those of other powers , from the superior resources which we possessed , and the high state of cultivation in which these colonies were . But the policy of France and Spain led these powers
