been made up . The late Mr. A. Douglas , who was paymaster to lord Melville , acted likewise under lord B . From the examination of lord B. it appears , that , during the time he held the office of Treasurer , no part of the money issued for the service of the Navy was applied to his use or advantage . His lordship further states , he did not believe that Mr. Douglas , during the time he acted as his paymaster , derived any profit or advantage from the use or employment of the public money , except the money issued for the payment of exchequer fees . Lord B . 's balance , when he quitted office , was 131,441l . 14s . 9¼d . The balance with which lord B. is at present charged , is 3,777l . 0s . 1¼d . of that sum 493l . 1s . 6½d . have been paid to personated seamen , which it has been usual to allow the treasurers upon the final settlement of their accounts : 1,646l . 3s . 2½d . are in the hands of the sub-accountants ; 1156 and with respect to the remainder , namely , 1,637l . 15s . 4¼d . it is stated that upwards of 900l . is in the bank , and that the residue , about 700l . is in the hands of lord B. was re-appointed on the 5th Jan. 1784 , and continued in office until the 1st June 1800 . In speaking of this treasurership , it will be necessary to divide it into two parts , as , from the 1st Jan. 1786 , the business was conducted under the provisions of the 25th of his majesty , c. 31 , which instituted a new mode of account for the office of Trearsurer . The old mode of account of course ceased on the 31st of Dec. 1785 , at which time Lord M. stood charged with 275,820l . 15s . 11d . out of which sum , and others advanced to him , he has continued to make payments as an ex-treasurer . The late Mr. A. Douglas having also acted as paymaster to lord M. during- this part of his 2d treasurership , we questioned lord M. whether he had derived any profit or advantage from the use or employment of the money issued for carrying on the current service of the Navy , between the 1st of Feb. 1784 and the 31st Dec. 1785 , which question his lordship objected to answering under the provisions of the 5th clause of the act by which we are constituted , and upon the ground before stated alluded to in his letter . held the Office from the 2d of June 1800 , to the 20th of Nov. 1801 ; Mr. Bathurst , from the 21st of Nov. 1801 , to the 2d of June 1803 ; Mr. Tierney , from the 3d of June 1803 , to the 28th of May 1804.—We have little further to state respecting these treasurers ; as we have already noticed their conduct , so far as relates to preventing the paymaster from drawing the public money from the Bank , and lodging it in the hands of a private banker , for the purpose of elucidating some parts of the detail of lord Melville 's second treasurership.—It appears , that none of them derived any profit or emolument from the use of money issued for navy services ; and that no part of that money was applied by any of them , to the use of any other public department.—Mr . Trotter acted as paymaster to lord Harrowby and Mr. Bathurst , and , for a short time , to Mr. Tierney ; he was succeeded by Mr. Latham , who continued in office till Mr. Canning became Treasurer , when Miv Trotter was again appointed paymaster.—It is stated by Mr. Latham , that he did not withdraw from the Bank any money issued for the service of the navy , bat transferred the same from the account of the treasurer to the accounts of
