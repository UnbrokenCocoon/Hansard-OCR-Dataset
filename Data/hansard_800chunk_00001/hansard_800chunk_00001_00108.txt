that bench ; and he implored them , as the greatest mark of friendship they could confer on him , to furnish an opportunity to disclose the source and spring of every action of his life , public and private ; more especially those which governed his conduct as first lord of the admiralty . said , that he could not Undertake to give any answer , or to enter into an explanation respecting what had passed in another place ; but , as far as his own enquiries went into the noble lord 's conduct , either before or after he left his situation , there did not certainly exist any grounds for thinking that such a 338 measure as the noble lord alluded to was in contemplation . again rose , and after making some apologies to the house , said , that he was not satisfied with that answer ; and that he positively repeated his demand to be informed , whether there was any intention to bring a charge against him , or not ? repeated , that according to any information he might be supposed , from his official situation to be capable of giving , he was not aware of the existence of any such intention as that to which the noble lord had alluded . wished to know whether another report , from which much was expected , would be forthcoming from the commission appointed to enquire into the naval department ?
