has particularly adverted to the support of public credit , and I have no doubt that in this respect the house will feel every disposition to concur with his majesty . That the burdens which the people must endure are heavy and unpleasing , must be confessed ; but considering the magnitude of the object for which we are contending , and the great efforts that must necessarily be made , I hope that these burdens will be borne with patience and unanimity.—These , Sir , are the principal circumstances to which I have thought it right to advert . With regard to the war with Spain , I trust that we shall not press to a rash and premature conclusion ; but that gentlemen will wait with patience till the information ordered by his majesty shall bring that affair completely before them : Without trespassing further on the house , or going more minutely into the particulars contained in his majesty 's address , I shall conclude with moving , that the following address be presented to his majesty , viz.— '' Most gracious sovereign , we , your majesty 's most dutiful and loyal subjects , the commons of the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , in parliament assembled , beg leave to return your majesty the thanks of this house for your most gracious speech from the throne . —We have witnessed with pride and satis- 28 faction the skill and intrepidity of your majesty 's navy , the respectable and formidable state of your majesty 's army and militia , the unabated zeal and improved discipline of a numerous volunteer force , and the general ardour manifested by all classes of your majesty 's subjects .
