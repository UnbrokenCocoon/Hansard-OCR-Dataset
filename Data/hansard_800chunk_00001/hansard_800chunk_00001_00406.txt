as well as every other branch of the executive government in that respect ; yet their lordships would recollect historically , not only that the most enlightened statesmen had from time to report bated the practice of the houses of parliament unnecessarily interfering with the 813 conduct of the executive government , but also that their very journals stated much jealousy of the houses of parliament taking into their hands the business of , executive government ; and it had been emphatically said that the sword should never be in any hand but that of his majesty . He would conceive , however , that some specific measures might be proposed , on the emergency of an occasion , and that any noble lord might propose them ; and although he should have many objections to any thing of that kind coming from any hands but those of the Executive government , especially if it were a proposition relative to the military establishment of the country , not in point of parliamentary form , for that he knew to be regular , but in point of expediency , which required that every thing of that kind should originate with executive government ; still if ministers had neglected to do what ought to be done , the more regular and the safer way would be to move an address to his majesty to remove them . If , however , any noble lord thought that there was any material deficiency , in the conduct of his majesty 's ministers , and yet did , not chuse to move that they should be removed , he might move upon it , but then he should make a distinct specific proposition , so that the house might at least ; know , the extent of the evil ; but this was so general that nobody could see the extent to which it might lead . His lordship then proceeded to defend the additional force bill . He denied , therefore , that this act had been , as was said of it , ineffectual . It had , on the contrary , been very considerably effective , and would be more so , if allowed to proceed . The ordinary recruiting had been increased by it , which had before been very much impaired . The army of reserve bill had raised a greater number of men in a short time , but had been found , to be attended with many inconveniencies , amongst which was that material and important one of raising the bounties . These incoveniencies all fell directly in the way of the success of the present bill at its first outset . To judge fairly of its probable success , they should look at its . operation for the last three months , and they would then be better able to judge what it was likely to do in future . His lordship agreed in opinion with the noble baron who brought forward the motion , as to the general scope of his arugument respecting the black corps ; but 814 the noble baron must recollect that , notwithstanding such a sort of force might be the best for the defence of such a country in such a climate , yet it was of that kind which particularly required that limitation should be attended to ; for it would be always necessary to proportion it to the number of white inhabitants , as well as to the number of white troops employed in the defence of the islandsâ€”His lordship next adverted to the subject of enlisting men for limited service , which had been so much praised , and which might possibly deserve much of the encomium that was paid to it . For his own part , he had given it every attention and consideration in his power , he found it of such high importance , that he would have made himself master of it , if he could ; but he found among those who were best informed on the subject whom he had consulted , so much doubt as to its success , that
