the greatest pride and satisfaction , that the skill and intrepidity of your Majesty 's Navy , the respectable and formidable state of your Army and Militia , the unabated zeal and improved discipline of a numerous Volunteer Force , and the general ardour manifested by all classes of your Majesty 's subjects , have , notwithstanding the incessant preparations for the invasion of this kingdom , been sufficient to deter the enemy from so presumptuous and desperate an enterprize . We fully concur and participate in your Majesty 's sentiments , that while this spirit continues to animate the country , and its voluntary exertions for its own defence subsist in their full vigour , we need not fear the consequences of the most powerful efforts on the part of the enemy : and we in treat your Majesty to be assured that we shall never forget that our security has arisen from the resolution with which we have met and provided against the danger , and that it can be preserved only by steady perseverance and unremitting activity.—We request your Majesty to accept our warmest acknowledgments for the communication which your Majesty has been pleased to make to us , relative to the War which Spain has declared against this country ; and we entreat your Majesty to allow us to express the just sense we entertain of your Majesty 's gracious condescension in having directed a copy of the Manifesto which your Majesty has caused to be prepared on this occasion to be laid before us , together with such papers as are necessary to explain the discussions which have taken place between your Majesty and the court of Madrid , and to assure your Majesty that we shall take them into our immediate and serious consideration , with the full resolution of adopting all such measures as are necessary to maintain the honour and dignity of your Majesty 's crown . and the security and interests of your dominions.—We entreat your Majesty to be persuaded , that it is impossible for us not to observe in common with all Europe , that the general conduct of the . French govt . on the continent has been marked by the utmost violence and outrage , and has shewn a wanton defiance of the rights of neutral territories , of the acknowledged privileges of accredited ministers , and of the established principles of the law of nations.—We return your Majesty our most grateful thanks for informing us , that notwithstanding these transactions , so repugnant to 8 every sentiment of moderation and justice , your Majesty has recently received a communication from the French govt . containing professions of a pacific disposition ; and we humbly request your Majesty to be assured , that we are thoroughly persuaded of your Majesty 's earnest wish to embrace the first opportunity of restoring the blessings of peace on such grounds as may be consistent with the permanent safety and interest of your dominions : we at the same time on our part , beg leave to be allowed to declare our entire concurrence in opinion with your Majesty , that those objects are closely connected with the general security of Europe.—We therefore rejoice to learn that your Majesty is engaged in confidential intercourse and connection with foreign powers with a view to that important object , and especially with the Emperor of Russia , who has given the strongest proof of the wise and dignified sentiments by which he is animated , and of the warm interest which he takes in the safety and independence of Europe , and we are fully satisfied of the propriety and wisdom of your Majesty 's determination in declining to enter into any more particular explanations without a previous communication with those powers.—We beg leave , with every sentiment of respect and dutiful attachment to your Majesty , to testify our most grateful sense of your Majesty 's uniform regard for the welfare of your people , and to assure your Majesty , that , in considering the great efforts and sacrifices which the nature of the contest requires , we most cordially participate
