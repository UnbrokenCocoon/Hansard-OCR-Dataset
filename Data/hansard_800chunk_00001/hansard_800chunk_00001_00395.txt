by their lordships ; this measure was so happily framed , that the effects produced by it were perfectly foreign from its professod 797 objects . It was to be regarded rather as a measure of finance , than one of military regulation on this head , his lordship went into some detailed calculation , and particularly dwelt upon the comparatively small number of men which were procured by the parish officers . The measure was , at best , inefficacious ; it was , in some parts of its operations , oppressive and unjust ; and being hither to productive of no one benefit , though it was in activity for ten months , including those the most favourable for its operation , there existed no reasonable ground to expect it would prove beneficial or serviceable in future , He would detain their lordships no longer , but conclude with moving , `` That a committee be appointed to revise the different acts passed in the two last sessions of parliament , for the military defence of the country ; and to consider of such farther measures as may be necessary to make that defence more complete and premanent . '' observed , that he should proceed upon the discussion of the important subject before their lordships , without making any political or personal allusion whatever ; and , it was with regret , that on a debate on a motion brought forward by a noble friend of his , about a fortnight ago , he felt himself under the necessity of making a few observations of that nature . With respect to the question before the house , he doubted not , but their lordships , on a reference to , and a consideration of , what appeared in the official documents upon the table , would make up their minds how it should be decided . With a view to the due illustration of the subject , he had laid on the table several documents , in addition to those moved by the noble baron , who came forward in the present instance , and other noble lords . Some of these respected the artillery , and by the accounts their lordships would see the increase , particularly in that important description of our military force . His lordship then entered into some detailed calculations , drawn from the documents adverted to , and , as one of the results , observed , it would clearly appear , the disposeable force was increased within the year , to an amount exceeding 13,000 men ; and this part of the army consisted of corps and troops the best calculated and prepared for foreign or for active service . The noble secretary enforced some of the arguments he had used in the former debate in support of the Additional Force 798 bill , and contended that , from the united operation and effects of the different measures for the regulation of the military system , the army was considerably increased , and in a progressive state of improvement and increase ; so that upon the whole , there was every reason to hope for the expected state of amelioration . With respect to discipline and increased numbers , it was therefore evidently unsafe materially to alter or derange that system . From the plans that were now in operation for organizing the force for limited service , the regular army or disposeable force would be materially benefited . From what he had stated , he trusted it would appear to their lordships , that no fewer than 23,000 men had been added to our military force within the year , as well by the ordinary mode of recruiting , as the other means of raising men , which were in a train of operation . He contended , that on the grounds of 28,000 men being raised within so short an interval , the prospect of a far greater and progressive increase , and the certainty of an improved and improving state of discipline and preparation ; it was evident no necessity whatever existed for the proceeding called for
