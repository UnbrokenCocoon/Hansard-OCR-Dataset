the like purpose.—By the returns on the table , the total army , exclusive of militia , was in Jan. 1804 , 143,251 men . Under strong impressions of ; the nature and magnitude of the contest in which we were engaged , and with a view to active warfare , and offensive operations , loudly called for by every statesman , nay , by every man in the country who had a sense of the , true interests , honour , or Very safety of the British dominion , parliament in Dec. 9 , 1803 , voted an army of 191,099 men , being an addition of 47,848 men to the then effective force.—Under law as such as have passed , measures such 624 as have been adopted , and ministers such as have succeeded , has the augmentation voted been acquired ? Have the views and injunctions of parliament been accomplished ? and if not , is there not a case for revision and enquiry ? The right hon . gent . on the other side of the . house , has stated an increase of army within the year of 11,409 men . This is admitted , ( but subject to observation on what that increase , consists of and whence it has arisen ) ; but taking it as stated , it leaves a deficit in the augmentation voted in Dec. 1803 , for the year 1804 , of no less than 36,339 men . The total of army in Jan. 1804 was 143,251 ; the total in Jan. 1805 , 154,660 , being an increase of 11,409 men . But in this period , ( comprized in the above totals , ) 1804 1805 The cavalry from 17117 are 21223 and have increased 4046 The artillery from 7661 are 8517 and have incensed 898 The foreign troops 13890 are 21208 and have increased 7318 Making an increase in above services of 12261 exceeding the total increase of army and therefore leaving to account of decrease in British infantry to such amount of 852 men , notwithstanding 105S infantry raised for rank , and 4297 raised in Scotland and Ireland on similar , or even worse and more destructive terms of levy , and so much is in further proof of a total failure of proper measures for recruiting the line.—Looking to establishing the fact of this failure , as ground for a committee of revision and inquiry , he would further observe , that whilst the cavalry encreased only 4046 ; . 4658 cavalry were in the same period raised for rank ; strongly implying that even this favourite branch of service could not sustain its number by ordinary recruiting . But , says the right hon . gent , we have had nearly 7000 men from the army of reserve enlist for general service , and taking these with the 11,000 augmented , we have 18,000 men , disposable force more than we had last year . In this the fallacy is obvious and to be detected , by merely recurring to the nature of the services recruited . Among the foreign troops are 5,401 native Ceylon troops a disposable force ? Are 1,018 Canadians and Halifax fencibles a. disposable force ? In fact , 6,818 enlisted from limited , for general service , is the only addition , and looking to Great 625 Britain and Ireland for a disposable force , as here only it can be looked for , our disposable infantry of all description is 53,6ll ; perhaps not more than required , on eventual and possible attack , in G. Britain , Ireland , Guernsey , and Jersey , as a regular army to give example to , lead , and conduct , the mass of new levies , militia , and volunteers , throughout the country , has the vote , then , of Dec. 1803 , been in any way accomplished ? And should we not inquire why it has not been accomplished ? Or is the sense of danger past , and the opinion of parliament altered ? Certainly not . Late as Jan. 1805 the house
