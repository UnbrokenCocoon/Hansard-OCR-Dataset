He wished to know whether these were Europeans independent of the troops of the Company . He was desirous also of knowing whether the regiments composing this aggregate number were nearly complete . in reply , said , that the troops were independent of the Company 's forces ; and that as far as he could understand , the numbers of the regiments were nearly complete . contended , that the number of European troops in India could not be much above 8 or 9000. declared , that though he could not precisely state their number , he was sure they were far above what the hon . gent , had represented.—The motion was then put and agreed to.—Upon the resolution respecting officers of the staff , said , it was not his wish unnecessarily to delay or interrupt the committee , but he could not suffer this item `` in the estimate to pass unnoticed . The charge for general officers , he said , was most enormous ; and how such a number could be deemed necessary , he was utterly at a loss to account . In England there were , he observed , no less than 136 general officers ; in Scotland 17 ; in Ireland 57 ; which , with one in Guernsey , and another in Jersey , made the whole number no less than 212 ; a thing , he said , quite unparalleled in the history of the country , in any age ; and the necessity for which , it would have become the right hon . gent , to have explained in a less summary way than he had been pleased to do . With respect to the volunteer force of the country , it was said , that a great number of staff officers were necessary to attend to their discipline ; but to his knowledge , those corps for some lime past had been by no means so numerous on their parades , or in the field , as heretofore ; and it appeared to him , that a great many more people were employed to attend to those corps that were at all necessary . replied , that the hon . gent , enjoyed an opportunity on the present occasion , in combating those items in his estimates from the aid . of a printed estimate , which he would hot have had but for his good nature in acceding to the motion for that purpose on a former night ; as this was almost the only instance of 251 such an estimate being brought forward to a committee in the printed form . The hon . gent . complained that the number and expence of general officers was unparalleled in the history of the country . But did he reflect also , that the occasion was unparalleled ? that the necessity of keeping up an army of 600,000 men to guard against invasion , was unparalleled ? or if it had not been for that volunteer force , which the hon . gent , now seemed to think of so little importance and productive of so much useless expence , the dangers which menaced the country would have burst over our heads , and we should have been involved in all that ruin so happily averted by their patriotic spirit and gallantry . replied , that as long as he had a seat in that house , he should feel it his right and his duty to
