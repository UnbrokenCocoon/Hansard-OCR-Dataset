rank and file per company . Since the estimate had been formed , however , a reformation had taken place , by which the total ' expence had been diminished , by the adoption of a plan for not voting the whole addition for the cavalry , but only eleven men per troop ; considering the effective of the cavalry at present and the current amount of the recruits raised , no material alteration would be made in that respect . The next description of force in which a material alteration had taken place was that which was raised in virtue of an act made 2 years ago , the Army of Reserve Act . By this act , 50,000 men were to be raised in the empire , 32,000 of which in England . A division into 16 districts had taken place with this view , each of which was to raise 2000 men . As it was difficult that any fixed standard could prevail among the various modes of recruiting by which this act was carried into execution , it was thought proper to form 16 ' garrison battalions , into which those who were under a certain size , or a certain age , or otherwise unfit for immediate service , had been incorporated . Those who were under age , who were the principal part of this force , having grown , had volunteered into the line , and by other changes , the whole amount of men in these battalions had been reduced to 1,500 men . It was , therefore , proposed to reduce them to 3 battalions , instead of 16 , by which a saving would be made in the charges for officers of 204,288l . There was some alteration in the charges for forces in India , but the expence of these was borne by the company . In the item of general and staff officers , an increase of 73,000l . had been made . This was principally in consequence of the system of brigading the volunteers , and annexing to the . brigades field officers , whose utility in improving their discipline had been fully demonstrated . A considerable reduction had been made in the embodied militia , which it was proposed to vote on the old system of 40,000 men for England , and 18,000 for Ireland , the charge for which would be 3,176,000l . instead of 2,663,000l . In the 249 charge of officers , an increase of 24,739l . had been made in consequence of an additional expence in the commissary general 's office ; and an increase of 8,000l . in the department of the horse guards . There was an increase in the charge for foreign corps , which arose from the augmentation in the German legion , now to contain 10,000 men , instead of 5,000 . In the barrack department the expence was a million less than it had been last year . It was still great , because , in consequence of the menaced invasion , it was necessary always to keep a considerable number of men on the coast ; a great part of these could not be lodged without barracks , which were now prepared for 8000 men . The right boa . gent , then proceeded to move the estimates , according to the following abstract , for G. Brit , and Ireland : NUMBERS Â£ . s. d.
