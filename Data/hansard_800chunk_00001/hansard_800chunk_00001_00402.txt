country on a committee of their lordships , lie could see nothing that could support such a motion but that constitutional ground of want of confidence of that house in the administration of the day , and the fair way of stating it was to call for evidence of facts , to ascertain what the state of the army was at this moment , and it that army was inadequate , and the exertions of ministers had been insufficient for the purposes of our protection , that should be stated as a ground for an address to his majesty to remove his ministers . On that point some difference of opinion might be entertained , perhaps , among those who opposed them ; however that might be , it was clearly the object of all motions of this kind , to censure , if not to remove ministers , and in that way he had no difficulty in meeting the motion at once , and to say that no ground existed for such a motion.—Having stated this as his opinion on the tendency of such motions as these , he should proceed to observe on the present one , which brought before the house this question , namely , what was the present military situation of this country ? And upon that subject he was ready to enter into a full discussion . He was ready to enter into a comparison of the military situation of this country at the present moment , and that of any former period , and of any other country ; and to discuss the point also , whether ministers had done all that could be done in that respect . The first question , then , was upon the general amount of our force , and here he must take the liberty of observing , that any stranger who had heard the noble lords who complained to-night of our military system , would be induced to think that we bad , at this moment , a smaller , a less efficient , and worse disciplined army than formerly ; now , if the fact was the reverse , if we had now a larger and a better disciplined army than at any former period , he would venture to ask , what ground there was for instituting the extraordinary measure proposed by this motion , in order that noble lords might take the administration of the military affairs of this country into their own hands . Now with respect to our force , he was ready to contend it was not only greater than it had been in any former period in this country , but greater than the military of any other country in comparison to its 808 population ; greater in that respect even than France , possessing for military purposes advantages over others by its revolutionary system , as indeed many others did over a country like ours , where every body was free , and would not be compelled to take upon him the military force of this country , exclusive of the volunteer force , of men who were taken away entirely from productive labour , and accumulating industry , in civil life and purely military in this country at this moment , could not be estimated much below 400,000 in the united kingdom exclusive he must repeat it , of the volunteer force , and which he should presently state . The military force of this country , including officers , was 390,000 men that was to say men who were withdrawn entirely from the civil employment of life and productive labour , and whose pursuits were purely military ; this taken from a population , of 15 millions , which , on a calculation , he believed , would produce one—fourth capable of bearing arms , that was,3,800,000 of male adults , and this would make actually one-tenth of the whole of the male population of the United Kingdom . Now , to compare this with the situation of other countries , we should see how much our military force was superior in that respect to any
