said G. B. Mainwaring , but many more for the said sir F. Burdett ; and the petitioners humbly submit , that if the poll had been cast up at such hour , without any further examination of such voters , the names of such voters ought to have been reckoned , and thereby a majority of votes received on the poll declared , as in foot it was , in favour of sir F. Burdett ; but the petitioners further state , that the poll was not cast up , nor the numbers declared , till the following day , and , in the mean time , the sheriff , in compliance with his aforesaid promise , proceeded to satisfy himself respecting the titles of the voters so previously entered on the poll , and , after such examination , directed marks to be set opposite to their names , some in favour of the said sip F. Burdett , and some for the said G. B. Mainwaring , according to the votes previously given for one or other of the said candidates ; that a majority of the votes received on the poll did thereby also appear in favour of sir F. Burdett , and the said sir F. Burdett ought to have been returned to serve in this present parliament for the county aforesaid ; and that the said sheriff , well knowing the premises , did , on the 16th day of the said election , illegally , wrongfully , wilfully , and falsely declare the majority of numbers to be in favour of the said G.
