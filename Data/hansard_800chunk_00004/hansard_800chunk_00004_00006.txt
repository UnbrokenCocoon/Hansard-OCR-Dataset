—To assure his majesty , that we have not failed to observe , with satisfaction , the unwearied activity and perseverance of his majesty 's fleets in the pursuit of the squadrons of the enemy , which have led , in every encounter , to a diminution of their force : —But that we beg especially to offer his majesty our warmest congratulations upon that unexampled victory over the combined fleets of France and Spain off cape Trafalgar , with which Providence vouchsafed to bless his majesty 's arms , under the command of the late lord viscount Nelson : —And , while we feel , with pride and exultation , that the skill and enterprize of his majesty 's officers and seamen have thus signally confirmed the maritime superiority of this country , and so essentially contributed to the security of his majesty 's dominions , we participate in the deep regret expressed by his majesty , that the day of that memorable triumph should have been clouded by the fall of the heroic commander by whom it was obtained : —That we are fully sensible that this lamented but glorious termination of a series of transcendent atchievements claims a distinguished expression of the lasting gratitude of the country ; and to assure his majesty , that we shall proceed , with heartfelt satisfaction , to enable his majesty to annex to those honours he has been graciously pleased to confer upon the family of the late lord viscount Nelson , such a mark of national munificence , as may preserve to the latest posterity the memory of his name and services , and the benefit of his great example : —That we beg leave to return his majesty our humble thanks , for having been graciously pleased to direct to be laid before us copies of the several treaties which have been entered into by his majesty with such of the powers on the Continent as had evinced a determination to resist the formidable and growing encroachments of France , and to 16 assure his majesty that we shall proceed to take them into our most serious consideration : —That while we deeply lament that the events of the war on the continent have led to an unfavourable issue , we feel , in common with his majesty , the consolation to be derived from the assurances his majesty continues to receive , from his august ally the emperor of Russia , of his unshaken adherence to that generous and enlightened policy by which he has hitherto been actuated ; and that we are fully sensible of the great importance of preserving at all times an intimate connection with that sovereign : —To assure his majesty , that we shall proceed to grant such supplies as in the present posture of affairs the public exigencies may appear to require ; and that we beg to return his majesty our humble thanks for the gracious and tender concern manifested for the welfare of his people , in having directed the sum of one million sterling , part of the proceeds arising from the sale of such prizes made on the powers with whom we are at war , as are by law vested in the crown , to be applied in aid of the Public service : —That we assure his majesty , that the pride and confidence we feel in the success of his majesty 's arms , has not diminished our sense of the necessity of unabated vigilance and exertion ; and that his majesty may firmly rely upon our attention being invariably directed to such measures as may appear best adapted to the improvement of those means , which are to be found in the bravery and discipline of his forces , the zeal and loyalty of every class of his subjects , and the unexhausted resources of his dominions , for rendering the British empire invincible at home , as well as formidable abroad ; convinced that by such efforts alone the contest in which we are engaged can be brought to a conclusion consistent with the safety and independence of the country , and
