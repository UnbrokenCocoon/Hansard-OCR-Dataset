The tax would branch , out into such a variety of ramifications , and affect such a variety of important interests , that it could not be agreed to allow the noble lord the delay which he asked , and he had no doubt , that the noble lord himself would be 1027 better prepared to discuss the subject at a fixture period and to perceive the force of the objections to it . He therefore gladly acceded to his desire of an opportunity of re-considering it . Those who opposed the tax would lose no opportunity of stating their objections . They would lose no stage of the bill , and might afterwards object to the Speaker 's leaving the chair .
