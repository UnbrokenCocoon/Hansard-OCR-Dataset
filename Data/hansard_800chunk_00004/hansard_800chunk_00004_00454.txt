duty , or of the provisions of the act ; in many places they had imagined government would be better pleased to receive fines than men ; they had understood the men were to be raised at the expence of the parishes , and not of the treasury ; And that upon the whole it was better to pay the penalty of twenty pounds at once , and be released from all further claims , than to pay a bounty of twelve guineas for a recruit , and to remain answerable for replacing him in case he deserted . The house will be informed of the disposition generally shewn by the parish-officers to profit by the information thus given them , and they will observe from the time this inspection took place , to the present time , being a period of not more than ten weeks , that the bill has produced above 300 men a week , although the prospect of its repeal has been counteracting its operation during the whole of that period.—I only wish the house to consider , if , under so defective a management , this bill has already furnished the army with about 13,000 men , and is now steadily producing at the rate of above 16,000 men a year , what might not be hoped for from it , when , instead of being hardly yet put into force in one half of the counties in the kingdom , it shall be gradually brought into general operation ? I must also request , that as a measure of pressure in point of charge on the country , the house will only compare its effects with either the militia or the army of reserve , and advert particularly to the fact , that differing from all other measures for obtaining men , by due exertion , the districts may discharge themselves , by finding the men , free from all expence whatever.—On the increased and increasing produce of this bill , with some slight alterations , which experience had suggested for its improvement , we confidently relied for the increase of the regular army , and the extension of the disposable branch of it ; these alterations were few and simple , principally the opening to the parishes a larger district for the levy of their men , 696 accompanied by a regulation , by which the parish officer should be enabled , if the recruit chose at once to take the higher bounty , and engage for general , rather than limited service , to engage him accordingly , being themselves of course entitled to the increased reward to which those levying men for general service are now entitled . This , coupled with some diminution of the bounty on the transfer from limited to unlimited service , diminishing thereby the temptation to persons meaning ultimately to enter for general service , passing intermediately through the limited service , and allowing the parishes three months instead of one to produce their men , before the penalties attached , it was conceived would facilitate the parishes in raising their quotas without encroaching on the general recruiting of the army , or inducing those to enter into the limited service , who could be induced by the higher bounty at once to engage for general service . With these and some other alterations , calculated to improve the operation of the measure , it was the intention of my late right hon . friend to rest satisfied during the war ; had he lived to conduct the public affairs till a peace , it certainly was in his contemplation then to revise the system generally , and to make it more applicable to one of its main objects , namely , the preserving at all times that portion of the army for limited service in such a state , in time of peace , though disbanded , as to afford an immediate resource to the country at the very outset of any future war . Peace he considered as the first moment which could justify any fundamental change in a system , which had
