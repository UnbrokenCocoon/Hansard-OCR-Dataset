letter of theirs of September 1803 , in which that Treaty is distinctly recognized , and rather favourable opinions expressed of certain arrangements respecting the ceded territories . Now , the fact , Mr. Grant said , which he asserted , and which he still maintained , was , that the court of directors did not know till pretty late in the year 1804 , any particulars of the negociations with the Nabob of Oude in 1801 , which ended in that treaty . The treaty came home nakedly , without explanation or comment ; afterwards public letters upon the revenue business of the districts which had been ceded by that treaty came home , and were answered in the usual routine of business ; one of the answers of the court the hon . gent . had quoted ; but all this time the court were ignorant of the means by which the districts had been acquired . The details of the negociations were sent , after long delay , by lord Wellesley to the Secret Committee ; and in the recesses of the secret committee they were locked up till late in the year 1804 . Then and then only the court of directors were allowed to see them ; and from these details it already appeared , that the cession of the districts had been produced from the Nabob by mere coercion , by absolute compulsion . The court of directors could not sanction what they held to be flagrant injustice ; they thought it their duty to remonstrate against it , and this is done in the letter to which the hon . gent . alluded , written early in 1805 . The hon . gent. , continued Mr. Grant , says concerning this letter , that it was written at a time when the directors were pretty Sure 873 it could not reach marquis Wellesley in India , and , therefore , when he could have no opportunity of answering it . But it has been already explained , that there is as continued chain of correspondence between the company and the governments in India : this chain is not broken upon the removal of a governor . The sentiments of the court of directors must still be transmitted upon all important events that pass there to the last moment of any governor 's residenceâ€”sentiments however which it may be impossible for him to learn during his stay in India . Nay , answers to letters written by the Bengal government in lord Wellesley 's time , have gone out since his arrival in England . This is unavoidable in the course of business , and has proceeded from no fear of meeting the discussions of lord Wellesley on any subject . The hon . gent . has further accused the court of Directors , of having written a letter in 1802 to lord Wellesley , desiring him to continue in the government of India , and then of brining forward , in 1805 , censures for acts clone be- fore 1802 . It is sufficient to say to an accusation otherwise so little conclusive , that by the influence of lord Wellesley 's powerful friends in this country , the court were induced in 1802 to ask him to continue one year longer in the government , in order to carry on a plan of retrenchments in expenditure which he was understood to have begun , and soon after the arrival of that letter in India , instead of pursuing that plan of retrenchments , he launched out into those measures of foreign policy and war which have had such unfavourable effects upon the company 's affairs . Mr. Grant concluded by saying , the directors were prepared and deter mined to maintain all they had advanced against marquis Wellesley , and were confident they should be able to substantiate every part of it . had no doubt that it was the wish Of the house as well as of the relations of marquis Wellesley , that the course they might take should not preclude investigation , but at the same time , he
