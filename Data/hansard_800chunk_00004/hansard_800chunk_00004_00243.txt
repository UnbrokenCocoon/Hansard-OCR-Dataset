give his vote , at a considerable loss of time , to some reasonable allowance for travelling charges and necessary refreshment ; but the usage of making such allowances had still thrown open a door to such extravagant demands on one hand , and gave such an opportunity for bribery on the other , that every fairintending candidate must have long since wished to see some effectual check put to such a system . Many determinations had taken place from time to time , upon representations and complaints of this nature ; but they were all upon distinct grounds , and none of them including all the objections for which remedy was desirable ; nor were there any cases which had occurred affording any series of precedents which could be decisive for the clear construction of the act . The chief difficulties had occurred in Westminster Hall ; and the courts of Common Pleas and King 's Bench had differed materially in their decisions upon the subject . In the former court , an action had been brought in the case of Crickett and others , on the part of a publican , to recover from a candidate a sum for refreshments given to his voters : but chief justice Eyre was of opinion , the law could not sustain such a demand , and that it was contrary to the act of William III . Another case occurred in the court of King 's Bench , in which the elector , who had come from Durham , where he resided , to give his vote at Taunton , where he possessed a right of voting for one of the candidates ; but before he would give his vote , he demanded 30l . for his conveyance and travelling expenses , and said he should not vote till he was paid . He was an itinerant musician ; he had calculated the expence , and would not give his vote without receiving his demand ; a suit was afterwards commenced against this man , upon the ground of bribery ; but the chief justice then , in summing up the evidence , found that a post-chaise from Durham to Taunton at eighteen-pence per mile , amounted to much the greater part of the charge ; that the man 's travelling . charges must also be considered , and some little allowance made for junketting with his friends at a time of election , to which , 373 adding his loss of time , the charge altogether was not considered to be of that exorbitant kind , that could justify a charge of corruption or bribery , and therefore the decision was in favour of the defendant . Notwithstanding , however , the decision of the Court of King 's Bench in that case , every man must feel the excessive hardship imposed upon a candidate who stood the election for any place situated as Taunton was . If he were to be put to the expence of 30 or 40l . for the conveyance of ally voter from the most distant part of the country , merely because that voter chose , for his own interest or convenience , to reside out of the town where he claimed such vote , and in some other town at a distance where his mere residence gave him the right of another vote , as was precisely the case here , the expences to which a candidate might be put in such cases for the conveyance of electors , to gratify their own wishes , and exercise their own privileges , for their own advantage , were as incalculable as they were unjust , and ought not to fall on the representative ; for it was not merely the actual expenses incurred , which they would have to pay , but the extravagant profusion too often indulged by such electors as these , when they felt themselves travelling not at their own charge , but at that of a candidate , whom they suppose well able to pay . With respect to county elections , the case was certainly different in relation to
