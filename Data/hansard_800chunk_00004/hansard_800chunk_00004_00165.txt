which I hold to be contrary to former practice ; to be injurious to the judicial character ; to be subversive of the liberty of the people : and which , I contend , has a direct and alarming tendency to blend and to amalgamate those great elementary principles of political power , which it is the very object of a free constitution to keep separate and distinct . In searching for precedents on this subject , I have been able to find but one single solitary instance of a common law judge having ever before been placed in this situation . The chancellor , it is true , is always a minister ; but no argument can possibly be founded on this circumstance , in favour of the present transaction . The chancellor stands on grounds totally distinct and separate from the twelve Judges , a distinction well known to our ancestors , who left the chancery judge amenable at the pleasure of the crown , but secured to the judges of the other courts , their offices and emoluments for life . The chancellor , as keeper of the king 's conscience , is brought into contact with the person of the sovereign ; and as the great officer of state , to whose custody the great seal is committed , is necessarily , from the very nature of his office , a political character ; and is , in fact , a responsible political agent of the crown , when he affixes the great seal to treaties , and other public instruments . On the other hand , it is to be observed , that the chancellor , being a minister , is not exposed to the same danger , as is the case of the twelve judges . No criminal trials come before him ; and it is difficult to conceive how political bias could well operate in these causes which are decided in his court . But with respect to the common law judges , the case is very 256 different ; and I must again repeat , that although the crown has occasionally referred to them for advice , in moments of great public difficulty ; although there may occur instances in which , on some extraordinary and special occasions , they may have assumed a species of political existence , for that special occasion , there is but one instance , from the revolution to the present day , of a common law judge having taken an habitual share in advising the crown on the ordinary course of state affairs.â€”The instance to which I allude is that of the great lord Mansfield . I believe it is true , and it is with regret that I admit it , that that great and splendid ornament to his profession , did hold the two situations of lord chief Justice of the King 's Bench , and of Cabinet Minister . But there were circumstances attending this latter appointment , which sufficiently proved the doubts which were even then entertained of its propriety ; and , it is satifactory to know , that on further consideration , and more mature reflection , the noble earl himself was so fully aware of the evils of the practice , and of the odium which attached to it , that no solicitation or entreaties could afterwards prevail upon him to form a part of the executive government . But , my lords , if this practice is to be tolerated in the chief justices of the King 's Bench , if it is to be represented as innocent in them , in whom , by the way , it is more peculiarly dangerous and offensive , than in any of the other judges , how comes it , that it has never been extended to those who preside in the other courts , and what security hare we against its being so extended in future ? A noble lord near me , who so lately sat upon the woolsack , when he was desirous of taking an active share in government , did not act a very prudent
