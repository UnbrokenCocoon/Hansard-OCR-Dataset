of that letter as relates to the treaties with the Nabobs of Oude and Furruckabad , because of the subjects discussed , in the letter those only had been to that tune brought before the house , and the ground upon which I thought those parts of the letter ought to be laid before the house , was this , that as the house had ordered , without objection or discussion , the production of another document which expressed , under the signatures of the committee of the court of directors , the approbation of those transactions entertained by the board of cool , missioners ; which document had of course made its own impression on the house there seemed an obvious principle which for bad the withholding another document . which expressed the disapprobation enter- 877 tained of the same transactions by the court of directors . But , sir respecting the whole of that letter , after what has been said of it , I desire to acknowledge my full share of any censure that may be thought due to it . They ability with which it is written , is far beyond any to which I have the least pretention , but I approved of every part of it , and never gave my assent to any measure , or put my name to any paper with a more perfect consciousness of doing what was right , and what my duty required of me .
