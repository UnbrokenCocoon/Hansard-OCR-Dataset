, that to the present commander-in-chief the British army is indebted for more 692 solid improvement than to any , or I might say to all those who have preceded him in that distinguished trust . But to return to the present state of the army in point of numbers , and that the house may fairly estimate the merits of that system , by the operation of which it has been brought to its present standard , I am desirous of comparing the amount and composition of the army as it stood on the 1st of Jan. 1804 , being the half-yearly period in the papers on the table , which immediately preceded on the table , which immediately preceded Mr. Pitt 's last return to government , with that of the army as it now stands . I select those periods , not to disparage in any degree the meritorious exertions of those who preceded him in office , whose measures for the increase and improvement of the army I shall always contend were highly vigorous and productive , but as forming the best criterion by which the effect of that system , which it is now proposed to explode and abrogate , can best be judged of . Including militia and artillery , the gross strength of the army at home and abroad stood as follows in effective rank and file : 1st Jan. 1804 , 234,005 1st March 1806 , 257,554 Increase 33,549 The regular army , including artillery , as distinguished front the militia : 1st Jan. 1804 , 148,486 1st March 1806 , 192,372 Increase 43,886 The regular army disposable for general service : 1st Jan. 1804 , 115,947 lst March 1806 , 165,790 Increase 49,843 This statement , I trust , will establish to the satisfaction of the house the important increase in gross strength which our army has received during the best two yearsâ€”they will likewise observe , whilst the numbers of the militia have been reduced , that the relative strength of the regular army has been advanced , and that the increase in the disposable branch of the regular army has been still more marked , being not less than 49,843 men , or neatly that of one-half . Whilst I concur with right hon . gent . in deeming a further augmentation of our force necessary under the present circumstances of the country , comparing the present amount with that at which it formerly stood when at the highest , it is impossible for the right hon . gent . to 693 depreciate either the high condition of our existing establishment , or the system by which it has been so rapidly augmented and improved . 1st Jan. 1802 , 242,440 1st March 1806 , 267,554 Present army more than at any former period , 25,114 Such being the actual strength and composition of the army , the next point to be ascertained is the annual waste to which the army may be deemed subject , and the presumable supply of recruits which may be reckoned on for filling up the casualties therein , and carrying the army forward to a still higher standard . Excluding the militia from our consideration in this view of the subject , and confining it to the regular army alone , by the returns before the house , it appears , that independent of any considerable loss of men sustained in the field , the annual average of deaths , desertions , and discharges , for the last six years , may be stated at about 15,000 men on our present numbers ; upon a like average of years , the ordinary recruiting in Europe for the regular army , exclusive of any extraordinary measures of supply , such as the reserve and additional force acts , has hardly ever sufficed to cover the actual waste of the army , independent of the augmented loss which may be expected , should any active operations on an extended scale be undertaken . We must therefore submit to have our army remain stationary , if not fall back in point of numbers , unless we
