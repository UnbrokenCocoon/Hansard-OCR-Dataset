, I beg to read to the house the opinion of Mr. Hatsell : — ? The object of the committee of ways and means as is ex- 622 pressed in the title of it , to find out modes of raising the supply which the house , upon resolutions reported from the Committee of Supply , and agreed to , have granted to his majesty ; and the first consideration attending this proceeding is , that the money proposed to be raised upon the subject by loans or taxes , or any other mode , should not exceed the . sum already granted in the Committee of Supply . It is for this reason incumbent upon the chancellor of the exchequer , or whatever member of the house of commons proposes the ways and means for raising money for the service of the current year , to explain and shew to the house , by a detail of the sums granted for the several services , that the amount of those sums will be a sufficient justification in point of quantity , to the committee of ways and means , to adopt such measures and impose such taxes , as shall be then recommended to them ; and this proceeding ( arising out of that regard and attention which the house of commons ought at all times to shew towards the people , that the burthens imposed upon them may not be larger than the public exigencies require ) ought for this reason , if for no other , to be most strictly adhered to . `` —Such being indisputably the true principle , I am not one of those who will ever contend , that what was meant as a protection and security for the people , shall be rendered prejudicial to their interests by its unqualified and strict application in all cases . I am ready to admit that a rigid adherence to his principle has not and can not in all cases be observed ; but what I do contend is , that a departure from it to the extent low proposed , and upon no assigned ground whatever , can not possibly be justified . The surplus of the consolidated fund , which it is the policy of parliament , for many reasons , to uphold , is a small departure from the strictness of the principle . The imposing war taxes to the amount hitherto of fourteen and now of twenty millions annual produce , is certainly a greater ; but still this is keeping largely within the obvious and necessary expenditure of the year , and is . adopted upon distinct consideration of the wisest policy.—But when the noble lord proceeds to raise the entire residue of he funds for the year , before the house has determined on the amount of the army ; when we are called upon to assume that what is now to be entirely new-modelled 623 is to cost neither more nor less than the exploded and condemned army of last year , and this upon the mere personal dictum of the chancellor of the exchequer , without even an estimate or account being laid on the table , it must be admitted that we are surrendering our judgment , and proceeding merely upon confidence : the possible inconveniences are obvious ; supposing the noble lord should have taken 5 millions more than the house may hereafter think fit to vote in supply , the people are in so much unnecessarily burthened . Supposing he should have taken 5 millions less than , in the view of parliament , the public exigencies may require , can he , after having made his loan and taught the contractors to expect , if not given them a pledge , that no more money would be raised , provide the necessary means with the same convenience and advantage to the public ? The noble lord not having offered a single observation to the house to justify this proceeding even on grounds of expediency , I can only state , that those which obviously suggest themselves as having occasioned it , are
