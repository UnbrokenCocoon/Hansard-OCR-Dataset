affairs of India , he congratulated himself ( in 1800 ) that circumstances were so changed , and the public opinion and that of the house so favourable , that to its most important affairs he could hardly bring down sufficient members to form a house . On such confidence and change of circumstances he congratulated the country . In such congratulation , I , sir , can not possibly join ; for to such confidence , and to the system pursued for 23 years past , I attribute the growth of an enemy more formidable to the happiness and prosperity of England , than the flotilla that menaces our shores from the coast of France . Sensible of the danger which few seem to be aware of , in the first week of the present session , I gave notice of my intention to bring before the house a subject which , whether considered in a political , in a commercial , or in a financial point of view , was second to none that could occupy the attention of parliament ; and , as a ground for future procedure , I moved for a letter from lord Melville to the chairman of the court of directors , which has tot yet been laid before the house . With the death of that truly great , illustrious , and ever-to-be-lamented character , the marquis Cornwallis , I believed , and still believe , the sun of Great Britain set in India ; that with him perished the last hopes of the country , for rendering India an aid instead of a burthen to the mother country : at all events , his death stimulated me still more strongly to persevere in the line of conduct I had imposed upon myself ; and , feeling that delay was most injurious to the best interests of the country , I , on a subsequent day , gave notice of my intention of moving for a select committee , to enquire into the truly alarming state of the company 's India debt , and into the causes of the disappointment of the just expectations of the public , and the total and entire failure of every term , condition , and stipulation for which they obtained their charter . That such a discussion has not yet taken place , can not with any justice be attributed to me . It has arisen from the state of the country , the state of the times , the state of the house , the want of a ministry , and especially from the absence of the members of the board of controul . —I am this night , preparatory to my intended motion , to move for some official returns , which will however occupy little time in 194 the preparation and production , and still less in reading ; for , I believe , that six of the eight returns I shall call for , will be answered by six simple negatives ; negatives , however , that will prove several gross violations of the law and high breaches of duty.—It will not be considered the least extraordinary of the circumstances of the present times , that lord Melville , who is now under impeachment for a violation of the law , and a high breach of duty , should , in 1793 , have brought in a bill for the most important purposes , and drawn up with a care , precision , and solemnity proportionate to the importance of the subject , a bill holding out great political , commercial , and financial advantages ; a bill to guard the happiness and prosperity of 40 millions of subjects , and to controul an expenditure of upwards of 230 millions ; and that , while he is under impeachment , his act has been violated in every section , except one , where `` the breach would have been more honorable than the observance . '' A misappropriation of the public money has taken place to an amount exceeding 20 millions sterling , and the violaters of the law have hitherto escaped
