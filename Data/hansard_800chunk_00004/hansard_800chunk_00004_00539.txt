, the board of commissioners had made themselves parties to that act , by the approbation they gave of the conduct , and therefore a complaint ought long ago to have been made against them , but this was not the proper course to take for that purpose . This case had been stated to be similar to a case of a document being called for , and produced on the subject of the trial of Mr. Hastings . But a distinction was to be taken between the two cases ; that was an act in itself legal , being a dispatch from government , and transmitted to India , and it became necessary to lay it before parliament in order to be decided upon ; that which was now called for was only the opinion of a number of individuals , and , whatever weight that opinion might have , the house would form its own upon the facts , and not upon the opinion of others , as the right hon . secretary had justly stated ; and , therefore , there was no ground laid for bringing this dispatch before the house . In saying this , he was not proposing to delay the remedy if there was any misconduct in the affairs of India ; for the propriety or impropriety of the transaction or Oude did not decide the general merits of the affairs of India , or of the con- 824 duct of the board of controul ; they must be decided on their own merits , and the opinion of individuals had nothing to do with the general view of the affairs of India . Nothing in the refusal of laying this dispatch before parliament would have the tendency of rendering the India board less amenable to parliament than they would be if the document was before the house . A great part of the speech of the noble lord went to impeach the conduct of the board of controul , mid to impeach the system of general policy acted upon in India ; but if he had any disposition to censure that board , he apprehended the noble lord would find some difficulty in getting the support of the house , but the non-compliance with this motion would be no obstacle to him in that pursuit . The truth was , that although he was aware that considerable difficulties attached to the affairs of this country in India , they were not insuperable , neither was he disposed to take the same gloomy view of them that some did . Certainly the expenditure was very heavy at present , but that arose from the state of war in which it was engaged , and which he hoped would be of short duration ; he was confident we should be able to struggle with those difficulties and to surmount them , and although gentlemen appeared to differ so much , yet he believed that on a close view of our condition in India , and a due consideration of all our circumstances , without which it would be impossible to form a correct opinion , the points of difference would not ultimately be so many as some gentlemen at present apprehended . There was one general observation to be made on this subject , and that was , that much of the conduct of the marquis of Wellesley , which some gentlemen appeared disposed to censure , was conduct in direct obedience to the direction of the legislature itself ; so that , if these measures were wrong , no complaint should be made against any power except that of the legislature . As to the general merits of the transaction to which the document now called for referred , opportunities would be afforded of discussing them in due season , and that discussion would embrace many points besides those to which that dispatch related , and which were not now under the view of the house , without which the discussion must be partial ; all which defects might be supplied hereafter by a full discussion of all the affairs of India ,
