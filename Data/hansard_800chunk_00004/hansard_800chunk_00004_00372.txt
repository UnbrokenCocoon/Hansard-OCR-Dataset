the amount of its burthen or annual debt , funded and unfunded ; and the next consideration was the means the country was in possession of to meet that debt , with a view to discharging the interest , and also that which he trusted the house would never lose sight of , namely , its ultimate and final extinction . He should first state the amount of the debt on the 1st of February 1805 , then the augmentation of that debt in 1806.—The amount of the funded debt on the 1st of Feb. 1805 , was 493,127,000l . the annual charge upon which was 18,000,000l . The amount of debt redeemed up to that day was 111,797,000l . the annual charge upon which was 6,834,000l . making together of debt , redeemed and unredeemed , 603.924,000l . and an annual charge of 24,904,000l . In the course of the year 1805 , there was made an addition of 34,400,000l . creating an annual charge of 1,392,0001. besides 2,420,000l . for the discharge of the loyalty loan , at an annual charge of 53,000l . making a total for that year of debt 36,827,000l . and of annual charge 1,445,000l . Against this was to be put a diminution of 531,000l . of debt , and 16,000l . of annual charge by the redemption of the land-tax , and by the commissioners for the reduction of the national debt a diminution of debt of 12,148,000l . ; making a total diminution of debt to the amount of 12,679,000l . and a diminution of annual charge to the amount of 386,000l . This presented , at the commencement of the present year , an amount of funded debt of 517,280,000l . The amount of debt redeemed was 123,476,000l.—With respect .to the Unfunded Debt , he would follow the same course , comparing the 566 state of it in 1805 and 1806 . On the 5th Jan. 1805 , there were outstanding exchequer bills to the amount of 25,253,500l , of which were provided for 12,388,400l. , leaving unprovided for 12,865,100l . ; navy debt , 5,100,000l . ; treasury bills 692,599l . ; barracks 1,567,000 . Ordnance expences and arrears of civil list , making a total of 20,305,686l . On the 5th Jan. 1806 , the outstanding exchequer bills were 27,180,400l . Of which , in anticipation of aids 12,180,400l . leaving unprovided for 15,000,000l . ; navy debt 9,570,000l . ; treasury bills 530,751l . ; with charges for barracks , army debt , ordnance charges , and civil-list arrears , making a total of 23,168,747l . Thus there was an addition to the unfunded debt of 2,863,161l.—He came now to the Ways and Means to meet this amount of debt , which he had thought it necessary to state thus fully and fairly , in order that the public might be completely aware of its situation , and that it might be prepared to make the . necessary exertions . The first of these was the Consolidated Fund , consisting of permanent taxes to the amount of 33,035,501l . from which Was to be deducted for arrears of assessed taxes , 110,000l . leaving a balance of 32,935,501l . The charges on the consolidated fund were the charges of the public debt , amounting to 23,102,733l . ; for paying off the five per cents.4,757,518l . making with civil list arrears of 958,000l . pensions 284,866l . miscellaneous services 2,170,000l . interest of the imperial loan 497,473l . and other lesser items , a total of 30,188,000l . ; from which after deducting 430,000l . for the purchase of the legal quays , there remained 29,758,000l . chargeable on the consolidated fund : so that on the consolidated fund there was an excess of charge of 3,177,500l . beyond the preceding year . This state of the consolidated fund he wished gentlemen to bear in mind , as it was to the consolidated fund that we were to look for the payment of the interest of the public debt.—But he wished them also to attend particularly to the state of the Sinking Fund , as it was
