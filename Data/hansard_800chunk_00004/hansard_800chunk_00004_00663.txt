and he found , that the gross force was , on the 1st July , 1804 , 246,410 , and on the 1st of 1008 Jan. , 1803 , 104,911 ; making an increase of 141,508 in 18 months , and for which he claimed credit on account of the uncommon exertions of the former administration , giving to the last all the benefit of the augmentation of 13,538 , on the 1st of Jan , 1806 : though as he had already stated , it was more than they were justly entitled to.—Having made these statements , he proceeded to examine the subject more immediately before the house , By the several acts for raising the Additional Force , it was proposed to raise , in the united kingdom , a number of men , equal to the deficiencies of the army of reserve , and likewise to raise a number of men in G. Britain equal to the deficiencies of the supplementary militia ; these deficiencies were to be raised immediately ; and in addition thereto , it was proposed to raise in the united kingdom , in the year ending 1st Oct. , 1805 , 14,800 men , making in the whole 41,415 men , to be raised on or before the 1st of Oct. , 1805 , from which , deducting the additional 14,800 , made the deficiencies of the army of reserve and the militia amount to 28,490 . He should now examine what had been done towards raising this force ; and it appeared by the returns on the table , that the gross number raised by parishes and regiments amounted , on the 14th of March , 1800 , to 12,925 , which was not one-third of the whole which ought to have been raised on 1st Oct. , 1805 , and leaving a deficiency of 28,490 ; and this giving credit for those raised by regimental recruiting , which was only to take place on the failure of the parish officers to produce their quota , and did not require the law to give it any effect . Of these 12,925 , there were raised by parish officers 8,975 , being something better than one-fifth of the whole.—Of the whole number England and Wales were to have raised 27,995 , of which the parishes and regiments had only raised 6,997 , not one-fourth of their proportion , and the parishes only 3,327 , not one-seventh of their proportion , leaving a total deficiency against England and Wales , on 14th March , 1806 , 20,998 . With reference , therefore , to the total to be raised , there appeared to be a complete failure.—But though it might be considered as too muck to demand the whole amount of 41,415 , yet surely there was reason to require a number equal to the deficiencies of the army of reserve and militia , especially as the latter could have been easily filled up by the ballot . These deficiencies amounted to 26,615 , to be immediately completed 1009 but the gross number raised by parishes and regiments , as before 12,925 , was not one-half ; and 8,925 raised by the parishes , or nominally so , was about one-third ; and in England and Wales , the 3,927 nominally raised by the parishes , was only a little more than one-half of the estimated deficiencies of the supplementary militia . Here , also , he contended , there was a complete failure . But there was another point of view in which he had a right to consider this measure , namely , with reference to those which it superseded . The house would recollect , that it was proposed to augment the Irish militia 10,000 men , which by accepting their voluntary offers to the same amount , of transferring their services to this country , world have augmented the domestic force 10,000 men , and set at liberty a proportionate number of disposable there ; but by , this measure we had only got in the whole , 8,712 effective men , on the 31st of Jan , 1806 ,
