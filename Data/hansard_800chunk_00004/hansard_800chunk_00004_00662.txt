Jan. and the 1st of March , 1806 , which was chiefly confined to the German legion , not derived from any exertion 's of the administration , but from the result of that most unfortunate expedition to the continent . But he should now proceed to compare the force as it stood on the 1st of July ; 18O4 , and 1st of Jan. , 18O4 , and again complained of the noble lord , for taking the force as it stood on the 1st of Jan. , instead of 1st of July , 1804 ; as the noble lord Must have surely recollected , that the hon . gent. , now no more , was not then in office , and that he did not come into office , until the end of May , from which time , until July , he had not attempted or proposed any one single measure for , augmenting the army , except the Parish Bill , which passed on the 29th of June ; whilst the measures of the preceding administration were in full force and vigour , and continued to operate with such effect , that 1007 he might be justified in taking the force as it stood on the 1st of Jan. , 1805 , and placing it , with the exception of the produce of the additional force , which would not be much relied on , to the credit of that government ; but he was not desirous of pressing gentlemen too closely , and should therefore take the gross force of the army on the 1st of July , 1804 , as the state in which it was left by the administration that preceded the last . The gross force on the 1st of Jan. , 1806 , was 259,952 , and on the first of July , 1804 , was 246,419 , being an increase , in 18 months , of only 13,533 ; whereas , taking it as it stood on the 1st of Jan. , 1804 , would give the noble lord 10,306 in favour of the last administration , but at the expense of the former , of which the noble lord was equally a distinguished member . But even of this 13,533 , the last administration were only entitled to credit for so much as had been produced by the additional force , it being the only measure proposed or adopted by them with a view of augmenting the army.â€”The disposable force , on the 1st of Jan.,1806 , was 161,541 , and on the 1st of July,1804 , 125,000 : being an increase of 36,541 , which since the actual addition to our army only amounted to 13,533 , required to be accounted for , and which appeared to have arisen partly from an obvious measure , requiring no great ability , that of transferring a part of the gross force from one service to another ; he therefore found that this increase of 36,541 disposable force , was composed of volunteers from the militia into the line , 14,685 ; volunteers from the army of reserve ( the measure of the former administration ) , about 6000 ; and from the additional force , between its commencement and the 31st of Jan. , 1806 , 3,154 , making together 23,839 . The remainder , which he had not the means of specifically accounting for , must be placed to the account of Irish levies , the foreign corps , the . augmentation of the cavalry ( also measures of the former government ) , and ordinary recruiting ; 3,154 men alone , being to be placed to the credit of the last administration , resulting from this their only contrivance for augmenting the army . But having seen , that in 18 months , ending the 1st of Jan. , 1806 , the gross force had only increased by 13,533 , it was only common justice , to compare the gross force as it stood on the 1st of Jan. , 1803 , and on the 1st July , 1804 , being likewise a period of 18 months ;
