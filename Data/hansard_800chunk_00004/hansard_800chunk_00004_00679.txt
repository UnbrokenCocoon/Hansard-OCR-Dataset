, that not one person was lost in consequence of the navigation laws having been maintained ; that the scarcity , and supposed loss of people ( which instead of 15,000 , did not amount to 1500 ) were the consequence of a hurricane , which destroyed the food of the negroes , and he would assert , that no operation of the navigation laws was at all in question , and drat the governors exercised 1032 the power of opening the ports as usual on emergency . He must notice an assertion , and an extraordinary assertion it was , that this measure was not an object for investigation or enquiry , but a kind of political measure with which the people had nothing to do , and that it merely transferred responsibility from West-India governors to his majesty 's ministers at home ; in other words , it took responsibility from those who alone could be judges of the necessity , and gave it to his majesty 's ministers at a great distance , who could not possibly know any thing of the matter . This power , however , must be delegated to the persons from whom the responsibility was removed ; that is , to persons who actually derive emoluments from the frequency of the abuse . If the petitioners were allowed to state how they would be aggrieved , they engaged to shew , that the British colonies in America which were in a rapid state of decline , in consequence of the suspensions of the navigation laws , must be utterly ruined even by this temporary measure ; and that if the British empire can not at all times furnish the necessary articles to the British West Indies ( the contrary of which however may be proved ) , that the intercourse with the American States for supplies , might be permitted and might be most surely and most steadily carried on as heretofore in British shipping , navigated according to law , of which there is and has been a large number unemployed , since neutral vessels had been permitted to enter the ports of the British West Indies . They would shew , that if the ships of the American States were permitted to enter the States of the British West India settlements , under pretence of supplying provisions , they would at the same time introduce , as they did at present , all East India and European goods , to the great detriment of the East India Company , and to the manufactures and commerce of the United Kingdom ; and also , that Ireland in particular would be deprived of the provision trade to the West Indies , to which she in common with the rest of the empire had a right , to return for the monopoly she afforded , at her own market , to the British West India produce ; they would prove that the value of British shipping was greatly depreciated ; that many were sold to the enemy and to neutrals , and that this nation was rapidly losing the carrying trade.â€” He should observe , that nothing is so ruinous to commercial speculation , especially when distant markets are in question , as uncertain and unsteady regulations ; fixed 1033 laws and rules alone , will encourage true commercial speculation ; and no man will engage in that commerce , which may , in a moment , be counteracted by uncontroled discretionary orders . He should ever protest in the strongest manner against measures , which have prevailed and are daily extending , to subject the navigation and trade of the country to the discretion of governors , or of a fluctuating committee of council ; he added that , if the papers he had moved for had been granted , it would have appeared that there had been memorials and representations from almost every part of the United Kingdom , against the very suspensions and practices which were to be facilitated and established by the bill ; and that the strongest remonstrances might be expected from our distant ports , as well
