so inconsistent with the true principles of freedom . He Was satisfied , that if ministers did not now see the impropriety of the measure , they soon would be Convinced by the disapprobation of the Country . He rather thought they doubted its propriety , but were too obstinate to confess their error . They would find , however , that it would have been better to lave given up file point when its danger was first exposed ; than to have waited till the discussion rendered it more odious all over the country . He concluded with Saying , that the first error , considering the authorities and examples , was venial ; but , to persevere would be a crime , because without the least necessity the measure risked that which Was so dear and so important to the country , the pure and the unsuspected administration of justice . said , he was not a little surprised at the language of the hon . and learned gent . who spoke last . He seemed to condemn the Conduct of ministers , because , the moment notice was given of the present motion , modesty had not induced them to accede to the object of it without rendering a discussion necessary . The late Minister , with whom that hon . and learned gent . had acted , had not certainly often shewn this excess of modesty , and at leas his right hon . friend near him ( Mr. Fox ) had not the advantage of any such example from their immediate predecessors in office .

He hoped the new opposition would be vigilant , and even wished that they Might be over-zealous , or any thing but over-numerous . He could endure the language of impatience from the hon . gentlemen in their altered predicament : one of them had lost a warm naval cloak ( Mr. Canning ) ; another , a splendid India shawl ( lord Castlereagh ) ; and a third , a graceful professional robe ( Mr. Perceval ) ; and it was natural to expect , they would feel a little the chill of disappointment . The hon . and learned gent . said , that lord Mansfield was a warning to every chief justice in future , on account of the distress he suffered from his folly in accepting a seat in the Cabinet . Lord Mansfield went out of office in 1760 , for the best reason in the world , because he was turned out . In 1765 , he again came into office , and soon afterwards went out for the same good reason , which he might assign in common with the hon . gentlemen opposite , because he
