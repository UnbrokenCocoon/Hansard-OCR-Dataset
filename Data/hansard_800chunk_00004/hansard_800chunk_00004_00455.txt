proved itself so mainly adequate , and there was nothing he more seriously deprecated than extensive alterations or further experiments during the war.—The right hon . gentleman proceeding on the opposite principle , seems determined to leave nothing untouched ; the form , shape , or extent of every branch of the service is to undergo revision , and to be subjected to change . To the large supply of men rapidly wanted for the extension of our present force ; to the chasm which is already occasioned in the army by inevitable casualties liable to be much increased , should the troops be more employed in the field , he has thought fit to add the progressive defalcation which must be occasioned by suffering the militia to waste down to the very low establishment of thirty thousand men , being eighteen thousand 697 for England alone below its present standard ; he also desires now to lay the foundation of a heavy annual loss of strength , which must be occasioned hereafter in the army , when the measure for limiting the term of service shall begin to operate ; and what does he propose to cover or counteract this obvious and formidable sacrifice of force ? absolutely nothing but his speculative assurance that more recruits will be obtained under his new system , although no change in the mode of recruiting is spoken of ; and upon this ground alone , the solidity of which I shall hereafter examine , he calls upon parliament , in the midst of war , to give up a present annual supply of sixteen thousand men , capable of considerable extension , and to concur with him in adopting innovations the most serious in the constitution of the army.—To the principle of improving the condition of the soldier distinct from the proposed change in the terms of his enlistment , if applied with prudence , I am far from having any objection . So far as we can , within the limits of a rational œconomy , ameliorate the condition of the soldier , and more particularly if we can , without immediate prejudice to his discipline , hold out to him rewards to increase in proportion as his length of faithful service may add to his claim upon the liberality of the country ; I am of opinion that the scheme is wise in itself , and may be productive of some good , though I conceive the right hon . gent . is disposed to expect much more from its immediate effect , in inducing men to enter into the army , than either the value of the temptation , or the remoteness of its operation , will in any degree warrant . Whatever may be , however , its effects , it is unobjectionable in principle : but I must beg the house to recollect , that it is quite as applicable to an army enlisted as ours now is , as if the proposed change had been effected , and that sit is in no degree requisite to alter the term of service of the soldier in order to give operation to this part of the plan ; on the contrary , I conceive it might be added with some effect as a further temptation to men to enter into the army.—The alteration of the term of the soldier 's enlistment is a very different question , and perhaps amongst the most serious and delicate in its bearings , which parliament has ever been called on to discuss ; it is impossible not to feel it to be the more critical , as it is one of those great changes of system , which once made , especially on the principles contended 698 for , can not be undone . Urged as this measure has frequently been by several of those who support it , particularly by the right hon . gent . ( Mr. Fox ) , on grounds connected with the individual freedom of the subject , I fear it is precisely one of those steps , from which , if taken in error , we
