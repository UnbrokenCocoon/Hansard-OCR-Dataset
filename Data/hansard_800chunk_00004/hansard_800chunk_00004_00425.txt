then they stand by , grinning and rubbing their hands , exulting in the confusion they have made , and calling triumphantly upon their successors to shew what they can do , in putting things to rights again.—Sir ; this task I am now to attempt , in that part of the affairs of the country which relates to its Military Establishments . I am to state to the house , those measures , by which his majesty 's servants are endeavouring to provide a permanent security against those permanent dangers , by which the existence of the country is threatened : for we have gone on too long in thinking only of the exigency of the moment , in supposing that our task was done when he had staved off the danger for the present year , though at the price of exhausting the resources and weakening the defences of the country , for years to come.—The first object that a person engaging in such a task must have to look to , though it may seem superfluous and almost pedantic , formally to lay down the position , is an Army : by which I mean , a class of men set apart from the general mass of the community , trained to particular uses , formed to peculiar notions , governed by peculiar laws , marked by particular distinctions ; who live in bodies by themselves , not fixed to any certain spot , nor bound by any settled employment ; who `` neither toil nor spin ; '' whose home is their regiment ; whose sole profession and duty it is to encounter and destroy the enemies of their country wherever they are to be met with , and who in consideration of their performing that duty , and the better to enable them to perform it , receive a stipend from the state , exempting them from the necessity of seeking a provision in any other mode of life . I do not mean to say , that Great Britain has not at this time , as it has had at all others , a class of men answering to this description ; that the men of this class are not as excellent in their kind as at any former period ; and that the amount of their number is not great as compared with any thing but the exigency of the times . I do not mean to assert either , that we are not , in our language , ready enough to confess their importance , and to declare , that in all the steps we take , we have for our chief object the increase and improvement of this description of men : but , what I do mean to say is , that our conduct in this 655 respect is at variance with our professions , as our language is , at different times , at variance with itself . Of all the measures connected with military objects , in which the house has been employed for years , what is the number that have even had in view the improvement of the regular army , and how much fewer are those , which can fairly pretend to have been conducive to that end ? Though the Army , it was said , was finally to be benefited , the first object of the measure has always been , not to create an Army , but a substitute for an Army ; and , in the course of this , we have so filled our minds with levies in mass , armed citizens , armed nations , and other ideas of that sort , that the very first conception and notion of an Army appear to be altogether forgotten . We seem to suppose , that whenever we have got a set of men together , no matter on what principle combined , have put them in a certain dress , ranged them in a certain order , and taught them certain exercises , that , as far as that number goes , we have created an Army ; which is
