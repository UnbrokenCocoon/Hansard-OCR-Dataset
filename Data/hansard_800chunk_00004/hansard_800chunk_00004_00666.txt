and 1,829 less than the period immediately preceding . He then stated , that from 15th June , 1805 to 31st Jan. , 1806 , 2,505 men . had volunteered from the additional force , being at the rate of 75Â¾ men per week , and for six months 1,969 , and only 140 men more than sufficient to supply the deficiency of ordinary recruiting in the last period of six months . And supposing that each man who volunteered received ten guineas , this gain of 140 men would have cost the public the enormous sum of 84 guineas per man , without referring to other expenses attending the execution of the measure , or to the inconvenience , the injustice , and the oppression resulting from its partial operation , to counterbalance which no advantages had been gained . He should state this in another point of view , and compare 7 months of ordinary recruiting , from 1st Feb. to 1st Sept. 1805 , with 7 months from 1st Sept. 1805 to 1st April , 1806 , from which it would appear that the first 7 months had produced 7,482 , and the last 7 months only 5,744 , being a decrease of 1,738 ; and comparing the last 7 months with a period of corresponding months in the years 1804 and 1805 , it would appear that the 7 corresponding months from the 1st Sept. 1804 to the 1st April , 1805 produced 7,477 , making a , decrease of 1,733 , in the 7 months from 1st Sept. , 1805 to 1st , April , 1806 , being 5 less than taking it successively . It appeared by the returns on the table , that the first three months of ordinary recruiting , in the year 1805 , had produced 3,562 , and the first three months in 1806 only 2,517 , being a decrease on three months of 1,045 , and per year of 4,180 ; whereas the volunteering for the first three months of 1806 , had produced 661 , which per year would be 2,644 being 1,536 short of supplying the deficiency in the ordinary recruiting . From these considerations he contended ; that the house must make up its naiad either to abandon 1013 this measure , or abandon the ordinary recruiting , which must , from a perseverance in this , be entirely ruined He could not agree that there was any better prospect success from its increased produce recently ; on the contrary , when the means used to effect that increase were considered , he was Confident that its continuance would only Occasion greater embarrassment ; and haying proved that the measure had utterly failed in every thing it had proposed , he should give his vote for its immediate repeal , without any view to the substitution of any other in its place . as he differed from his hon colleague ( Mr. Wilberforce ) in the vote he meant to give , thought it , necessary to state his reasons for voting as he should do on this occasion . He agreed , however , with his hon . colleague , that the then could not be raised as the act directs . Yet he should not vote for its repeal , because the rt . hon . gent . had brought forward the measures for its repeal in conjunction with other measures , Until he should be able to judge of those other measures . The question was not , whether this bill was to he continued , bill whether the house should give it up before they knew what was to be substituted for it . For his own part , he should not agree to give up any measure that produced any supply to the military force of the country for any theories of any rt . hon . gent . He did not mean to anticipate what might be the measures to be produced by the rt . hon . gent. , but should say , that from his opening statement of them , they appeared to him extremely disgusting to the
