arguments hitherto adduced , had the least application to it . He thought he knew what he read , and if he did misread it , the language of the preamble of the bill , was sufficiently plain to warrant his assertion , and which , was accordingly quoted by his lordship ; the bill , therefore , was no more than eventually to enable the said governors to exercise the same discretion legally , which before they were in the habit of doing under the pressure of circumstances ; and for which , from year to year , they applied for a parliamentary indemnity ; the present bill went to authorise the same discretion , when the necessity of the case appeared to them to require its exercise ; that is , the bill , went to permit his majesty , by the advice of his privy council , to permit prospectively , the exercise of such a discretionary power in the governors , when they should see the necessity for using it . He deprecated the conjuring up , as some noble lords seemed to do , gloomy prospects , and prophecying the greatest national calamities , on an occasion ; which merely went , in a decent and constitutional mode , to enable his majesty , with the advice of his privy council , to vest , occasionally , discretionary power in certain of his governors . shortly explained ; he referred to the wise policy of our ancestors , who had placed the suspension of the navigation laws beyond the power of any privy council ; and again contended for the paramount importance of preserving inviolate the investigation laws of the country . contended warmly for the propriety and superior policy of the measure in question ; which , in effect , was a continuation of a practice which noble 1037 lords had themselves countenanced from year to year , and not a single complaint had been heard against it . professed himself a warm friend to the navigation laws ; but he was nevertheless friendly to the present bill , which he conceived to be necessary for the support of our West India colonies The articles which were immediately necessary for the food of the inhabitants , for their habitations , and for the cultivation of the soil , were , with the exception of beef and pork , the growth and produce of America . For this country , therefore , to attempt to supply exclusively the colonies , must be attended with an enormous expence ; whilst at the same , during a period of war , and particularly when , as at present , the enemy had adopted the mode of sending out flying squadrons to different quarters , the ships necessary to protect such a trade , would be more than we could spare fron those essential services to which our navy ought to be directed . He did not attach that importance to the trade carried on in British Bottoms , for the supply of our West-India colonies , which other noble lords seemed inclined to do , as he believed the vessels employed were small , being chiefly of the class of schooners ; and with respect to the seamen on board those vessels , they were most of them Blacks , whom he did not wish to see employed in tint description of service . He did not mean to extend his opinion with respect to the necessity of such a measure as the present to a period of peace , as he thought during peace this country might , without difficulty , supply the colonies ; but during war he clearly agreed in its necessity . objected to the bill , and thought that the shipping interest of the country ought to have been heard by their counsel against it , in order that the subject might be fully investigated . said that he never wished to object to any class of his Majesty 's subjects petitioning against any bill in that house being heard by their counsel against it ; but the petitioners , in the
