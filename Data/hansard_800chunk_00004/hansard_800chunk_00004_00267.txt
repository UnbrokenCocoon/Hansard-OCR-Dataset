that `` the public are hereby informed that the sub-treasurer at the presidency , & c. have been authorized to receive any sums of money , '' & c. it goes on to say , `` the principal of the promissory notes shall be payable either in Bengal under the rules established for the payment of the register debt now existing , or by bills to be drawn by the governor-general in council , on the hon . court of directors ; which bills shall be granted at any time on the application of the proprietor of the notes , either when the principal shall have become payable in Bengal , or at any earlier period . `` —Taking for granted , then , that this has seen the mode of proceeding , the next question 407 was , whether it has been with or without the authority of the court of directors ? —If without their authority , it was as far as he could understand , though it was not the question of law , but the matter of fact which he wished to establish , directly in the face of the 110th clause of the act of 1793 , which provides , `` that nothing in this act shall extend to authorize any of the governments in India to grant bills for the purpose of transferring or remitting the said debts from India to Great Britain , to become due and payable within any one year , exceeding in amount the sum of 500,000l . unless by the special order and authority of the court of directors of the said company , for that purpose first had and Obtained . `` —To issue , therefore , promissory notes exchangeable at the pleasure of the holder for bills on the court of directors , provided the amount of such promissory notes exceeded the sum of 500,000l . in any one year , he contended to be against the express provisions and meaning of this act .
