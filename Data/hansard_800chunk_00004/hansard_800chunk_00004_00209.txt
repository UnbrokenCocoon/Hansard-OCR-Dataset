It must be admitted , that these acts give some degree of countenance to the introduction of the Chief Justice into a situation of political trust , connected with the administration of the executive government.—But , when the right hon . gent . assumes the Regency Council which was a fixed body , not removeable by the regent , and composed of other persons besides the executive officers of the crown , ( the princes of the blood royal for instance , and the archbishop of Canterbury ) to be similar to the Cabinet , either in its constitution or in its functions , he assumes more than the obvious nature of that council will warrant.—It is also to be observed , that the authority of acts of parliament on points collateral and incidental to the main object of the act , more especially when no question arose at the time in respect to such points , are entitled comparatively to but little attention . The general policy of these bills was , it is true , fully discussed , but no question was separately made upon the propriety of including the Chief Justice . His nomination passed in silence . It was proposed in discussions on the act of 1705 , to exclude from the council lord Godolphin , then at the head of the treasury , the objection in this instance was evidently levelled at the individual and not at the office , and the proposition was over-ruled , as was another to include the lord mayor of London.—With these exceptions , the propriety of the official selections was little canvassed ; but if the Chief Justice 's name had even been introduced into those bills on the most mature deliberation , it would by no means follow that the same reasons must justify the introduction of that Magistrate into the Cabinet , which might properly induce the legislature to give him a place in a permanent council of the nature alluded to , a council entrusted , during the minority or absence of the sovereign , with the exercise as well as with the conservation of the rights and property of the crown.—It is also to be observed , except during the short period of about five weeks , which elapsed between the death of queen Anne and the arrival of George the First in England , that none of these acts were ever acted upon . No experience , therefore , could be had of their practical inconvenience in this or any other instance ; but , the most superficial 321 consideration of them will be sufficient to satisfy any candid mind , that their frame and constitution is wholly inapplicable to the present times . Their authority , as precedents in the debates on the regency in 1788 , was generally condemned , and by no individual with more ability or effect than by the noble lord now at the head of his majesty 's councils.—when he filled the chair of this house.—We have , however , a class of precedents entitled to more consideration , namely , those commissions proceeding immediately from the crown . which vested in certain persons under the title of Custodes Regni , removeable at pleasure , and bearing , in that particular , a closer resemblance to the members of the Cabinet , such powers as are necessary for carrying on the executive government in the absence of the king .. Of these , there are upwards of twenty which occur between the revolution and the year 1755 . But in none does the name of the Chief Justice appear . The Functions of the Custodes Regni being exercised under the direction of the sovereign , and upon communication with him , the same precautions were not requisite for the security of the rights of the crown , which were necessary while the king was minor ; and this observation may explain , why such characters as the Archbishop of Canterbury , and the Chief Justice Of the King 's Bench were introduced into the parliamentary councils of regency , whilst they were excluded from those immediately appointed by
