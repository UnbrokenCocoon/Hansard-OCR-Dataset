gave their sanction to the substitution of crimps in their place , to each of whom 21 . 12s . 6d . was to be given per man . This direction was directly followed up by the orders issued by the inspector-general , which no less distinctly recommended the pointing out of the double bounty to be trios obtained for unlimited service.—Mr . H. here entered into a detailed examination of the reports from the inspecting field officers , and the lord lieutenants , from which he read extracts , aid on which he grounded some 1011 strong observations . The letters to which he principally adverted , were Mr. Poole 's letters to lord Bulkeley ; Mr. Marie 's letters to , the clerk of the general meeting for Lancashire ; and the letters from lieut , -col. Clay , lieut.-col. Maclean , and col , Robertson ; captains Carrol , Dickens , and Fearon , & c. to the inspector-general.—From these documents it appeared : 1st , that the employment of crimps was expressly recommended , and carried into effect ; 2dly , that the extension of the recruiting limits was expressly encouraged , and acted upon , in direct violation of the act of parliament ally , that the success of the measure was confined to manufacturing districts , and that it failed in agricultural and maritime counties ; 4thly , that the double bounty was expressly held out as an inducement to enter in the first instance ; and 5thly , that injury Was done to regular recruiting by the competition between the two services.—Mr . H. then proceeded to make several calculations shewing the effects of this measure on ordinary recruiting , and said he should take the period of 6 months of ordinary recruiting , commencing 1st Feb. , and ending the 1st Aug. , 1803 , and which immediately preceded the vigorous operations of the army of reserve act , and should compare that period with 5 subsequent periods of 6 Months each , ending 1st Feb. , 1806 ; not because this 1st period was the best period of ordinary recruiting in the returns then before the house , for even it was considerably embarrassed by the ballot for the militia , which was then proceeding , and had actually raised for that service within the period 58,000 men ; but because it immediately preceded the 12 months during which the ballot for the army of reserve and for the militia was carrying on with the greatest vigour , the effect of which , and of its suspension upon the recruiting service , would be thereby the more distinctly seen . The first period of 6 months , from the 1st Feb. to the 1st Aug. , 1803 , produced 6,538 men . The second period , from the 1st Aug. , 1803 , to the 1st of Feb. , 1804 , produced 4,504 , being a decrease of 2,034 . The third period , from 1st Feb. to 1st Aug. , 1804 , produced 3,749 , being 2,789 less than the first period . In the course of these 12 months upwards of 70,000 men had been raised for the army of reserve and the militia , and in the 18 months 130,000 . The fourth , period , from the 1st Aug. , 1804 , to 1st . Feb. , 1805 , the army of reserve act being suspended , and the militia 1012 nearly complete , ordinary recruiting produced 5,949 , being only 589 less than the first period . The fifth period , from the 1st Feb. to the 1st Aug. , 1805 , the measure now under consideration not having begun to operate with any vigour , produced 6,698 , being 160 men more than the 1st period . But as soon as the parish officers commenced acting upon lord Hawkesbury 's letter of the 16th Sep. , 1805 , its effects were ; immediately felt by the recruiting service , which from the 1st Aug. , 1805 , to the 1st Feb. , 1806 , produced only 4,869 , being 1,669 less than the first period
