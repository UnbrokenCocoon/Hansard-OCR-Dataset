after some days laid before them . The production of it here , therefore , was no longer necessary for the only object I had in view . I consequently determined to relinquish my intention to move for the papers ; and I did so the more readily , from the consideration that persons to whose judgments I feel , and ought to feel deference , saw objections to the production of that paper ; and also because , although the paper in question expresses the general sentiments of the court of directors , I might , in moving for it , appear to commit that body with regard to the necessity of its production here , which I had no authority to do.—But these considerations without the more material one of the paper having been produced elsewhere , would have given place to the anxiety I felt , to exempt even the limited share and space which I occupy in the court of directors , from that proportion of the merit or demerit which may be thought hereafter to attach to the transactions in question . I trust I have shewn , that , there was no inconsistency in my relinquishing my intention of moving for those papers , and now that the paper in question , and others , are moved for by the noble lord , I certainly shall vote for their production , though I can not vote for it exactly on the grounds stated by the noble lord ; for I am unable to perceive , how the production of the paper in question , can be considered as furnishing ground of accusation against any party , against the board of commissioners , any more than against the court of directors . For , surely , if the proceedings at Oude , and any other proceedings animadverted upon in that document , have been just and right , the court of directors will be open to censure for the disappro- 814 bation expressed of them on that account , and the board of commissioners will be entitled to commendation for having rejected it . To consider , therefore , the paper as furnishing a ground of accusation against either party , seems to me , would be like prejudging that question . But I shall support the motion on what appears to me to be broader ground—that every paper on Indian affairs , that has been called for since the attention of this house and the public has been drawn to the late transactions in India , has been granted indiscriminately . And in respect to the Oude transactions , there is this additional argument for the production at least of so much of the document in question , as relates to them ; namely , that the house has already ordered the production , of a paper , expressing the approbation entertained of those transactions by the board of India commissioners . That paper of course has made its own impression on the house . The paper in question on the other hand , expresses the disapprobation entertained by the court of directors of the same transactions : and as the former has been granted , there seems an obvious principle in favour of not withholding the other ; or at least of so much of it as relates to those affairs which are before the house ; namely , those of Oude and Furruckabad . At the same time I am aware , that the production of that particular paper is liable to the objection , that it is a proposed letter or dispatch only , which was not transmitted , and of course no opportunity of answering it given to the government , to which it was meant to be addressed . This objection I should feel to be decisive against the production of the paper now , if the late governor-general were still absent in India ; but , as he is on the spot , it is open to him to have a copy of the paper to answer it , and to have a copy of his answer also
