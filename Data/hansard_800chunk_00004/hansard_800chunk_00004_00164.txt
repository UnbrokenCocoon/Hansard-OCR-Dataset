my conduct by them ; and so anxious was I , that in the present momentous crisis of the affairs of the country and of Europe , his majesty 's government should enjoy the unanimous support of parliament , and of the public , that it was not till I had failed 254 in my efforts to obtain the object of my motion , by private and confidential representation , that I reluctantly brought my mind to disturb that unanimity , even for a single day , by the agitation of this important question . With respect to the question itself , I have no hesitation in saying , that all that I have heard , and all that I have since read and thought upon the subject , have only served to confirm and strengthen the first impression of my mind ; and I feel confident , that the oftener it is considered , and the more thoroughly it is investigated , the more clearly will it appear that the situation which the lord chief justice now holds in the Cabinet , is not only unwarranted by established usage , but is in direct repugnance to those sacred and fundamental principles of policy , which can alone secure to the people of any country , the pure and impartial administration of their laws . I am aware , my lords , that there is considerable difficulty in affixing to that situation , with legal accuracy and precision , the character of a responsible minister of the crown . But , whether he is to be legally considered as a minister of the crown , or only as an adviser of the ministers , as long as he is the associate of these ministers , and a party to their measures and their feelings , my objections to the promotion remain in their full force , I am , therefore , satisfied to rest this part of this case upon one single observation ; and , when I have asked the house whether it would endure to see the lord chief justice hold the office of lord president of the council ? which can only be answered by the most decided negative , I would put it to the feelings of every noble lord , who joins in that negative , whether it would not be a most mischievous practice , to separate that high ministerial station into its two component parts of power and of emolument : and , by throwing away the husk of the salary as food for baser minds , to be thereby enabled to give the power , the influence , the vital essence of the appointment , all that can be an object to enlarged ambition , all that true greatness can value or desire ; to be enabled , my lords , to give this in a concealed and invisible manner , to those who could not dare to accept it in the ostensible and embodied shape of a cabinet office.â€”My lords , we have now learned from authority , that it has been determined that the lord chief justice should be an habitual member of that committee of the privy council , usually called the Cabinet . The deliberations 255 of the Cabinet are not like those of the body of the privy council , from which it is selected , confined to proceedings of a judicial nature ; but embrace all the political concerns of the country of every description . It is the duty and office of the Cabinet , to advise the Crown , in the exercise of all its functions . To be a member of the Cabinet , is therefore necessarily to be a party to all the measures of the administration ; and is to be associated in the power , and identified with the interests of the executive government . It is this close and intimate connection between a judge and the king 's ministers ; it is this association and identification of a judge , with the executive government , which ( whatever be its legal name ) , I condemn and reprobate ;
