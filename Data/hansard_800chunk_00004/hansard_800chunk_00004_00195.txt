had not been answered on this head . He thought that the holding a situation which was in its nature precarious , and yet an object of ambition , had a tendency to destroy the confidence which resulted from the independence of the judge . He trusted he could not be here misunderstood , so far as to be thought to allude to any particular individual . He only viewed the point in the abstract , and contended , that when you placed , in the situation above referred to , a person who by law had been jealously , made independent , you did in a great measure do away the effects of that independence . This would be evident , if once it was admitted , and it could not he denied 300 that the removal of a lord chief justice from a place which was an object of ambition , would be attended with sonic degree of discredit to him , for , to avoid this discredit , there would at least , on some occasions , be a temptation for him to act in a manner not altogether consistent with his duty and character . That it was an object of ambition to hold a place in the Cabinet , he thought could not be denied . The thing had of late been abundantly proved ; for it was impossible to converse in the street , or read the newspapers during the last six weeks , without knowing how eagerly such places were sought after . In four instances it had been lately proved that Cabinet places were considered as objects of ambition , in addition to other efficient situations . He therefore , he supposed , might take it for granted , that a place in the Cabinet was an object of ambition ; and when this was admitted , the matter of salaries and emoluments made very little difference in the present question . The right hon . gent . agreed in the panegyrics that had been pronounced on the administration of justice in this country . It was one of the greatest blessings , if not the very greatest , of our constitution . It was no less firm than it was valuable . It had withstood the shock of parties , of usurpation , and of rebellion . To what cause were we to attribute this ? Not to any particular statute by which the distinction between the judicial and the executive powers had been established , but from the universal feeling and sentiment that such a distinction ought to exist , and that with the exception of a very few instances it had existed . But , if the administration of justice in the country was thus admirable , it was the most important of all duties , and would afford ample employment for all the talents , virtues , integrity , and every other excellent qualification , which had been justly ascribed to the noble and learned lord who at present occupied the situation of lord chief justice . What he objected to was this , that instead of confining the attention of any lord chief justice to the discharge of his duty in that capacity , which would afford him full and ample employment , you were starting other objects of ambition to which his views might be directed . He would indeed still pursue the objects which were more intimately connected with his profession ; but instead of building his fame on the strict and honourable administra- 301 tion of justice , he might be aspiring after other objects of ambition . A most serious evil was thus introduced , which would be done away by the passing of these motions ; or , if that could not be hoped for , he would at least indulge the expectation , that it would be remedied by the mature and unbiassed reflection of those persons who now formed his majesty 's administration.â€”There was one very great fault and error into which the right hon . gent . had fallen , for his argument seemed to imply , that independence
