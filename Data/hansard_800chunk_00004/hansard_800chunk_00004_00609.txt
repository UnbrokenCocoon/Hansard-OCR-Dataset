the different funds of this country , as in that case the amount of the exemptions would be easily calculated . would object to any measure leading to subject foreigners to the operation of the property tax ; not however , on their account , but on our own , as it must be obvious that the consequence of such a measure would be their withdrawing their property to the funds of other countries in Europe , a circumstance that was not at all desirable for this country . could see no danger of that sort , nor did he know any other country in which they could lodge their money with equal security . He thought , that upon every principle of justice , the property of foreigners ought to contribute to the expence of its protection . Besides , this distinction would impose an . additional difficulty in the collection of the tax , as it would not be easy to ascertain what part really belonged to foreigners . said , that foreigners might withdraw their money and place it either in the Irish bank or in the American funds.—The motion was then agreed to . rose and said : —Sir , as several gentlemen were not present , when I had the honour to present the First Charge , upon which hereafter I mean to move for the Impeachment of the marquis of Wellesley ; and as many gentlemen are even ignorant of the allegations contained in that charge , before I apply evidence to the fact , and state the grounds upon which I tan entitled to the printing of the charge , such gentlemen 933 may be of opinion that the charge had better be read ; however , this to me is matter of perfect indifference ; having made the charge , I am capable of arguing upon it , and applying the facts ; and as the wish of the house seems rather against the reading , I shall proceed to state the reasons why the charge ought now to be printed.—I certainly , sir , could wish to blot from my recollection , if possible , till disgraceful scene that occurred , when I presented this charge to the house of commons ; but that scene , if it were possible for me to forget it , will not be forgotten or forgiven by the dispassionate and thinking part of the people of England ; or the injury , sir , that one of the representatives sustained , whilst in the act of bringing forward their cause , certainly no cause of my own ; whilst endeavouring to bring to condign punishment , a delinquent most powerfully protected , and whose profusion , whose extravagance , whose corruption , prodigality and waste , have grievously added , and will still add greatly to the burthens of the people of this country ; but , sir , that nobleman can not now escape , and had he taken sanctuary in the bosom , instead of the house of the premier of England , even that , sir , could not now secure him from the hand of justice.—It has been said , sir , I do not know for what purpose , or for what end , that I came into this house purposely to accuse the marquis of Wellesley ; I do not think it necessary either to admit or deny the fact ; but , if such was my motive , I can only say , that it was rather more disinterested than generally happens in these days of corruption ; but , considering the quarter from which the remark proceeded ( from Mr. Wellesley Pole ) and the tone , temper , and gesticulation ( however unparliamentary in which it was conveyed ) , I appreciate the observations as I ought ; but if such a motive could be questionable , I appeal to the house and to the public to decide between my motives and conduct , compared with that of the relatives of the marquis of Wellesley.—I wish at present to throw no reflection on the character of
