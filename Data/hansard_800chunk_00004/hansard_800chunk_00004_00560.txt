by loans and additional taxes , supporting a wanton and p o use style of living , unparalleled in the case of 855 any former chief governor of that country , insomuch that he Was driven by his extravagance to attempt the selling of the imposts upon the lands of Bengal , and he so much embarrassed the finances and affairs of the company , as to endanger the loss of their territory . The statement next proceeded to recapitulate the contents of the letter received by the court of directors from the marquis Cornwallis , dated in August 1805 , when sent out to India for the purpose of superseding marquis Wellesley , in which he gives a deplorable statement of the company 's affairs , arising entirely front the profuseness of his predecessor in squandering the resources of the company , one branch of which was his keeping up unnecessarily an army of irregular troops at an enormous .expense , which the marquis Cornwallis found it absolutely necessary to disband , in order to avoid losing the means of defraying the charges indispensable for the maintenance of the regular army . The noble marquis , in disbanding those troops , stated , that lie adopted the measure unavoidably , as the lesser evil , at the risk , certainly , of their engaging in other service inimical to the company , but considering them much less formidable to meet in the field , than to retain them in pay , at an expence which must absorb the means of paying the regular army ; that in order to clear the arrears of pay due to those irregulars , he had been under the absolute necessity of detaining the treasure of the company destined for the China trade , to the amount of 250,000l . Having gone through many other items on the letter of marquis Cornwallis , already before the public , the statement next alluded to the war which broke out in the month of March 1799 , with Tippoo Sultan , which ended with the taking of Seringapatam and the death of that tyrant ; that the consequence of that war was , that enormous sums of money were extorted by order of marquis Wellesley from the Nabobs of Oude , Arcot , Ferruckabad , and some others ; after which commenced the Mahratta war in 1804 , which was terminated in the course of the year ; arid so far from the expences of those wars being the cause of those embarrassments of the company 's affairs already stated , it appeared , from letters of lord Wellesley himself to the court of directors , that , by the treaty of Hyderabad , the annual revenues in the provinces that then became tributary increased their income above 544,000l . a year , and there 856 fore that any argument founded upon the pretence of warlike expenses could not , as would appear from marquis Wellesley 's own letter , dated the 1st September , 1803 , interfere with the causes of the inability of he company to pay their annual engagements to the state . That except the wars before mentioned , the said marquis Wellesley was engaged in on other war during he period of his government , except that with Holkar , if war it could be called , and except that with the Rajah of Bhurtpore , in which the only loss sustained was the loss of lives and of honour . That there fore , not wars , but the unexampled prodigality and wanton profusion of the marquis , were the true causes of the embarrassment of the company 's affairs ; a profusion and extravagance engaged in with the most sinister , vicious , and corrupt views , and in defiance of the authority , and in contempt of the orders of his employers . The embarrassment partly . arose from new-modelling the criminal courts of Bengal ; from increasing , wantonly . and unnecessarily , the number of their officers , and giving large salaries to his friends acid favourites ; in the expenditure of an enormous sum for
