in every important cause , but had conducted causes of this description during that period in the court of King 's Bench . But with the history of his professional life , their lordships had no concern , otherwise than as it was connected with the pre- 248 sent enquiry . For this purpose it was material to declare , that , although his experience was equal not only to any individual judge on the bench , but to all the Judges , with their collective practice ; yet , that he never knew a single objection to have been taken to an interrogatory proposed , because the reply to it would render the witness responsible in a civil suit . It was true , that in Mr. Peake 's book , which had been frequently cited on the present occasion , there was a note by which it should appear that an objection of this kind had been taken by the late chief justice Kenyon ; but , notwithstanding his high opinion of the minute accuracy and great learning of that reporter , he thought he had , in this instance , been guilty of a mistake on two grounds : 1st , because he himself had been counsel in the cause , and had no recollection of the circumstance ; 2dly , because , if that note were correct , lord Kenyon must have been guilty of an obvious contradiction of his own principles and sentiments , as they appeared even on the face of the same report . His lordship was of opinion , that the bill now proposed would not effectually answer the purpose intended by the noble mover : he most heartily concurred in the object , but most materially differed from him as to the means of effecting it . Notwithstanding some difference of opinion among high authorities , among persons for whom he had the greatest veneration , yet he could not help thinking that the law itself was unembarrassed from these contradictions . He considered it so far precise , clear , and perspicuous , that it was necessary no new law should be promulgated , otherwise than in the form of a declaratory law , by which it should be announced what had been the law , what was the law , and what ought to be the law , and what should be the law of the land as to this important particular . On these grounds he could not give his assent to the bill now suggested ; and if no other noble lord , more competent than himself , would undertake the business , he should himself move a legislative regulation , with the view to place the question for ever in repose . perfectly coincided with the sentiments of his noble and learned friend on the woolsack . The labours of his existence had also been devoted to the same arduous duties , and he had attended a circuit the largest in extent , and the most comprehensive in the variety of 249 its business ; but neither in the course of his experience on his itinerant duties , nor during his constant application at Westminster-hall , where he might say he had been engaged in almost every important cause , nor since he had been called by his majesty 's pleasure to the bench where he now had the honour to preside , did he recollect a single instance where the objection had been taken , that the answer of the witness would place the deponent in a situation of responsibility to a civil suit . It was true , that where the reply to the question would expose the witness to the consequences of a criminal prosecution , his lordship always felt it his duty to caution him from the bench ; but even in that case , partial communications must not be made , the testimony must not be garbled ; if a portion were imparted , the whole evidence must be disclosed ; and so it was held by the noble and learned lord whom he had the honour to succeed , with
