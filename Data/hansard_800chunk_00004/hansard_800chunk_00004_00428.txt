as leading to conclusions different from those which experience has hitherto taught , they are no more than theory ; whilst I , whom they accuse as theoretical , am keeping close in my conduct , whatever I may do in my hopes , to the dull and beaten road of experience.—In the mean time the facts and reflections above set forth , the object of which is to recall to gentlemen 's minds the importance of regular armies , will not be deemed superfluous or misplaced , if we either consider the system which has been pursued by the country for some years past , or turn our thoughts at once to the result , namely , the very important , and , as some may think , very alarming fact , that of the regular forces , ( as it is now the fashion to call them ) to which the defence of this country must be entrusted in case of invasion , not less than one hundred thousand are composed of troops , who , by the very tenure of their service , can have never seen a battle , till they come to fight that first ( and perhaps last ) battle , ( against troops , too , such as they will have to contend with ) , which must be decisive , probably of the fate of the country.— Assuming , then , the importance of regular armies , which no one denies , but which every one seems disposed to forget , the next enquiry is , —how they are to be obtained ? that is to say , in the present instance , how we are to insure to the country , what , for many years , unquestionably , it has never had , —a constant and permanent source of recruiting adequate to the supply of its regular forces ? —The nature of things here yields us but the option of one of two modes ; force or choice . In most of the countries of Europe , the nature of the government admits of a recurrence to the former of these modes ; and , undoubtedly , whenever that is the case , where the power of the government is 659 such , that persons acting in its behalf , have no more to do than to go forth among the artisans and the peasantry , taking with them the standard they mean to observe of age and size , and selecting , of those who are found to answer it , as many as will suit their purpose , there can be no process so easy , so effectual , so certain ; but , unluckily for the present object , though happily for every other , this is a process to which this country can not resort . It is not that the abstract right is wanting ; there must be in every country a supreme power , and , in theory , nothing can limit what is supreme ; but practically , the exercise of this power is so fettered and controlled , the measures of force which we can employ are so confined to legal forms , so abridged , restricted , constrained , and modified , that the effect is reduced to almost nothing ; the machine is stopt by its friction.—But , it is not merely on the score of Inefficacy that measures of this sort are objectionable . The force of free countries , while it is inefficacious often in respect to its object , is ten times more efficacious than that of the most arbitrary , with respect to the severity of its operation . A purely arbitrary power is , by its nature , a discretionary one ; and discretion , when vested in proper hands , and where no temptation exists to the abuse of it , is the best and mildest of all rules . A German prince , or Russian nobleman , who had his subjects or vassals before him , could dispense with the man to whom service was a hardship , and say to another ,
