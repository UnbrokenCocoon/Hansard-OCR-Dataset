voluntarily forward , beyond all calculation of expectancy , the government , therefore , preferred the services of the volunteers to a forcible levy en masse ; not , however , totally abandoning the alternative of the bill , should it be necessary to carry its operation into effect . He had in his hand , a copy of the returns made from every quarter of the country , in the first year , of the number of men in each district , properly classed ; and what he now wished to move for was , the returns of the years 1804 and 1805 . He hoped his majesty 's ministers had those documents before them , as they certainly would be important for the consideration of the , house in discussing the 561 plan of defence , whatever it was , now in contemplation , and for the explanation of which the public were extremely anxious , and particularly the volunteers , who were very desirous to be informed as to what was intended towards them . For it was extremely important , if the services of the volunteers were to be relinquished under the new arrangement , that not a single fire-lock or sabre should be taken from their hands until the country was assured of a more adequate establishment . He concluded by moving for the returns of men enrolled under the levy en masse act , in every district throughout Great Britain , in the last and preceding year . said , that so far was he from being averse to the production of the documents now moved for by the hon . gent . that he should support his motion . The subject was so very new to his own experience , that he knew very little indeed of the present state of the matter . However , as the bill had been passed now three years , and his majesty 's present ministers had been so short a time in office , if any remissness or delay was chargeable in procuring those returns for the last two years , their share of the blame certainly was not the largest . He was pretty confident that the subject of the right hon . gent . 's motion would from a very principal feature in the plan of defence now in the contemplation of his right hon . friend , not now in his place , ( Mr. Windham ) , who was certainly as anxious to bring his plan forward , and felt as much regret for the unavoidable delay that had occurred , as any other member of that house . As to the objects of his right hon . friend 's plan , he should think it premature to say more at present ; but he could assure the house , that no delay had occurred that was at all avoidable , and he hoped that in a very few days his right hon . friend would be able to bring his plan forward . hoped the right hon . gent . would not bring forward his plan without timely notice . Indeed , as it had not come forward sooner , and so considerable a number of gentlemen must be absent during the assizes , who would wish to be present at the discussion of such a measure , he thought it would be desirable to postpone it till after the recess . expressed his hope , that his right hon . friend would be able , in his place tomorrow , to give notice of the day on which he should be ready to bring his plan forward , 562 and if not then , on Saturday , if the house should be disposed to sit on that day . But with respect to the suggestion of postponing the proposition of the plan until after the recess , he did not think that could be necessary , as it would be desirable to make some progress with the least possible delay and to bring forward any bills on the subject that might be thought necessary.â€”The motion was then put and carried
