acquainted the house , that the house had this day been at the house of peers , at the desire of the lords commissioners appointed under the great seal , for opening and holding this present parliament ; and that the lord high chancellor , being one of the said commissioners , made a speech to both houses of parliament ; of which he had , to prevent mistakes , obtained a copy.—He then proceeded to read the speech from the chair , for which we refer to our report of the proceedings of the lords , sec p. 1 . After the Speaker had finished reading the speech , rose , and spoke as follows : —I rise , sir , for the purpose of moving an humble address to his majesty , in answer to his gracious speech , in which address I trust I shall have the unanimous concurrence of the house . 14 For those , brilliant successes of his majesty 's arms by sea , which have so eminently distinguished the naval history of the past year , I am confident the house will fully coincide in the sentiments expressed in his majesty 's speech ; ? but , above all , in what relates to the glorious and ever-memorable victory off cape Trafalgar , under the gallant and justly regretted hero who achieved that proud triumph for his country before he had nobly fallen in her cause , and left her to deplore a loss , in which , I am convinced , every man who hears him , sincerely participates the concern expressed by his majesty : and I feel the strongest reliance that the house , in its liberality , and justice to the memory of that great and gallant commander , will cheerfully meet the royal wishes , and enable his majesty to add to the honours already conferred upon his family such signal rewards as shall mark the public gratitude for the important victories , and the public security which the nation so eminently owes to his prowess . But , sir , while the country has such proud and distinguished cause of triumph in her naval successes during the last year , and more particularly in that of the victory off cape Trafalgar , I am confident the house must deeply participate in those feelings of regret , expressed by his majesty , for the reverses sustained by our allies on the Continent , and the melancholy issue of the late campaign . At the same time the house and the country must feel high consolation in the manly conduct , and the unshaken attachment manifested by our faithful ally , the emperor of Russia , to those principles and that enlightened policy , which have uniformly distinguished his reign : a circumstance , which still affords us reasonable ground to hope , that affairs on the Continent may yet be brought to a favourable issue . In the crisis , however , in which this country now stands , we have nothing to fear from the haughty menaces , or the insatiable ambition of the common enemy , while defended by the known loyalty and valour of his majesty 's subjects , and the unexhausted resources of this empire ; in the vigorous application of which , I am confident the wisdom and spirit of the house will cheerfully co-operate with his majesty , for maintaining the contest in such a manner , as to sustain the country in her wonted rank amongst the nations of Europe , and for bringing the present arduous contest to an honourable and 15 advantageous conclusion . Without troubling the house any farther , I shall conclude , sir , with moving , `` That an humble address be presented to his majesty , to return his majesty the thanks of this house for the gracious speech delivered by his majesty 's command to both houses of parliament : —To express to his majesty our sincere condolence for the loss which his majesty and the royal family have sustained by the death of his late royal brother the duke of Gloucester :
