tire crown.—The single correct precedent of modern times on which any argument can be founded , is that of lord Mansfield ; and , in referring to that solitary case , it is fair to consider it as deriving a sanction not only from the evidence it affords of the noble lord 's own opinion on the subject , but from the acquiescence of those who either sat with him in the Cabinet , or suffered him to sit there unquestioned in parliament.—I consider the case of lord Mansfield , as the only one really in point : that of lord Hardwicke being clearly inapplicable , inasmuch as he never had a seat in the Cabinet till he had accepted the Seals , and only held the chief justiceship for a few months , till his successor Chief Justice Lee was appointed . He had then ceased to act as Chief Justice , and had taken upon him the character and all the Functions of chancellor , political as well judicial.—It might well he contended that the weight of precedent , were it stronger than it is , 322 would only go to render it more necessary to correct the practice if it be inexpedient , as I maintain it to be . The countenance which this measure may derive from precedent , may render less censurable those by whom it has been advised or adopted : but , perseverance in a bad practice can not be justified on any such ground.—I own , however , that the precedent of lord Mansfield appears to me calculated rather to serve as a beacon , to warn his successors what they should avoid , than to operate as au encouragement to them to follow his example . No Judge of more comprehensive knowledge , or of more splendid talents , ever sat upon the Bench , yet no one ever possessed in a less degree the confidence of the public . He was regarded with jealousy , ( perhaps unjustly so ) as carrying his political feelings with him into court , and was never able to conquer the effects of having so intimately connected himself with the politics aid the party of the day . There is every real son to believe , that lord Mansfield was himself deeply impressed with the sense of his own indiscretion , in having become a member of the Cabinet . He certainly declined to return to it after the year 1765 , and is said to have lamented to the last hour of his life , that he had ever suffered himself to be placed in this anomalous and hazardous predicament.—The arguments drawn by analogy from the circumstance of chief Justices being habitually members of the house of peers and of the privy council , will prove nothing in support of their being called to the Cabinet upon ordinary occasions , if the purposes for which they are placed in those situations are fairly considered . The house of lords being a Judicial body and a court of appeal , necessarily requires the presence of legal characters , to conduct a jurisdiction Which in practice devolves entirely on them , and no persons can be so fit to be entrusted with this task , as the chief Judges , and superior members of the professions without whose aid the whole direction of the house on legal subjects would devolve on the chancellor for the time being : a circumstance by no means to be desired.—So introduced into the legislature , they are certainly not precluded by any law from entering into all the heat of politics : but it is equally certain , that in so doing they would forfeit much of the respect and reverence , which is now paid to them , and it would be justly imputed to them as an impro- 323 priety of conduct , not considered as the necessary effect of their being admitted into the house of peers , if they should use the privileges of the peerage in a manner inconsistent with the dignity of the judicial character.—The same reasoning applies to the privy council ;
