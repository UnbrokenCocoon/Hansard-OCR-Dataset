give ; a and , lastly , between the zemindars and their ryots , to each of whom is left , out of the produce of his labour , the means wherewith to subsist in a greater or less degree of ease , there being , according to the laws and usages of the country , no possibility of his acquiring any thing to which the name of property can apply . That , from such a state of existence , so degrading in the eyes of Britons , it became a British governor and commander ( if at all justified in interfering ) to endeavour to exalt the people of Oude ; but that , as it will hereinafter appear , the aforesaid marquis Wellesley , after having , under pretences the most groundless , encroached upon and extended his sway over the principality of Oude , did , upon the people thereof , impose burthens greatly surpassing any that had ever been imposed even by the most oppressive of their native sovereigns , their aumils , or their zemindars.—That the British connection with Oude began in the year 1765 , under the governor-generalship of Robert lord Clive , by the treaty of Allahabad , being a treaty of peace , and of defensive alliance between the East-India company and the then reigning sovereign sujah ul Dowlah ; stipulating , amongst other things , that , `` in case the dominions of his highness Sujah ul Dowlah shall at any time hereafter be attacked , the English company shall assist him with forces according to the exigency of his affairs , and that in such case the extraordinary expence of the forces so employed , shall be defrayed by him ; '' the said treaty in form , language , and tenour , fully shewing , that the said nabob vizier Sujah ul Dowlah was , to all intents and purposes , the sovereign of a state perfectly independent . That , in 1768 , by a treaty made at Benares , between the English company and the na- 369 bob vizier Sujah ul Dowlah , an explanatory clause was added to the treaty of Allahabad , respecting the number of troops to be in future maintained by his highness , and confirming the said treaty of Allahabad.—That in the year 1773 , under the governor-generalship of Warren Hastings , esquire , a treaty of cession and of subsidy was made at Benares between the English company and the nabob vizier Sujah ul Dowlah ; by which treaty , were ceded for ever to the vizier and his heirs , three considerable districts of country , then belonging to or claimed by the company ; in consideration of which it was stipulated , on the part of the nabob vizier , that he should pay to the English company , at different periods there stated , 50 lacks of sicca rupees ; and , in a. second article , it was stipulated , in order to prevent disputes concerning the payments to be made by the nabob vizier for expences of the company 's troops , which might be called to march to his assistance , that the expence of a brigade should be computed at 2 lacks 10,000 sicca rupees ( or 26,250l . ) per month , such brigade to consist of 2 battalions of European , 6 battalions of sepoys , and I company of artillery : and further it was stipulated , that , `` exclusive of the above- mentioned sum , no more shall , on any account , be demanded from him ; and should the company and the English chiefs have occasion to send for the troops of the nabob vizier , the company and the English chiefs shall also pay their expences in the like manner . '' That in the year 1775 , upon the death of Sujah ul Dowlah , Warren Hastings , esq. , being still governor-general , as aforesaid , a new treaty was made at Lucknow , between the English company and the nabob vizier Asoph ul Dowlah , son and successor of Sujah ul Dowlah
