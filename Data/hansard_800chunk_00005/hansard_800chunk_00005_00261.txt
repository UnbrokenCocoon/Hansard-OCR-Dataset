That the said marquis Wellesley , thus falsely pretending , did , on the 2d of June 1801 , thus write to the nabob vizier : `` The publication of the articles tendered by his excellency to the governor-general , and still more any attempt to carry them into effect , would inevitably occasion the most dreadful convulsions in the province of Oude , and would for ever alienate from his excellency 's person arid government every sentiment of affection , obedience , or respect ; and the governor-general , therefore , not only expresses his anxious hope that the nabob vizier will never revive the project contained in the proposed articles , but his lordship most earnestly recommends it to his excellency to exert every possible precaution to prevent the tenour of those propositions from transpiring in his excellency 's court , or among any description of his excellency 's subjects . `` —That the said marquis Wellesley , while he was thus writing to the nabob vizier , while he was thus expressing his apprehensions lest the nabob vizier should suffer the knowledge of his wish , so expressed , to transpire amongst any description of his subjects , was actually conveying to the said William Scott the instructions here following ; to wit : `` I conclude , that you have retained an attested copy of the paper of requests , of which you have sent me the original .
