those of the said rajahs and zemindars who had the misfortune to incur the displeasure and the vengeance of the said marquis Wellesley was the rajah Bugwunt Sing , zemindar of Sasnee and Bidjeghur , a Hindu prince residing in the extremity of the Doab , on the north-western frontier of Oude , the head of a powerful tribe , surrounded by a numerous and warlike body of vassals and adherents , whom the personal bravery and private worth of their chief had strongly attached to his fortunes ; beloved by the whole country , on account of the equity and the liberality of his character ; possessing an extensive district , several considerable towns , and two strong forts , from which he took his title ; and able to bring 20,000 men to the field.—That the said rajah Bugwunt Sing had for a long time farmed the jumma ( or land revenue ) and the sayer ( or duties ) of the surrounding districts , under Almas Ali Khan , one of the great aumils of the nabob vizier , for regular terms of 3 years , conformably with the practice which prevailed throughout that part of the said nabob vizier 's territories.—That the said marquis Wellesley , in pursuance of his before-mentioned unjust determination respecting the said rajahs and zemindars , and in pursuance of his before-mentioned unjust determination to increase the burthens of the people of the said extorted countries , did , by means of his before-mentioned unlawful agents , require of the said rajah Bugwunt 1030 Sing an enormous increase of the rents which he had before paid , did positively insist upon the separation of the jumma and the sayer , and did declare that he would grant no engagement to the said rajah , either for the jumma or the sayer , for more than one year.—That the said rajah Bugwunt Sing , naturally averse to a measure so injurious to his own interests , did , in the most respectful and conciliating manner , state his objections to the 2 last-mentioned conditions of the said proposals.—That the collector of the district , who was employed as the agent of communication between rajah Bugwunt Sing and the before-mentioned hon .
