Wight ; and , if no answer was given , information to that effect . '' Also , `` a list of the several barns rented by government and used as Barracks in the division of Sandown Bay , in the Isle of Wight , specifying the rent now weekly or annually paid for each barn , and also specifying the precise time when any alteration ( if any ) in the rent of the said barns took place . '' Upon these the previous question was also put and carried . expressed his regret that the business would make its way into the public prints . asked if the hon gent . ( Mr. Paull ) had fixed on the day on which he meant to bring forward the motion against lord Wellesley , relative to Oude ? mentioned Monday week ; but on the suggestion of the Speaker , fixed it for the first day after the holidays ; stating that he should lay the charge on the table , and at the same time move for witnesses to be called in , and also for a few papers in support of it . The hon . gent then moved , that the order of a former day , for the production of the protest taken by Mr. Bosanquet , against an approval by the court of directors of lord Wellesley 's conduct , be discharged .

He also gave notice , that on Monday next he would , in the committee of ways and means , propose a new tax in lieu of the Iron tax . He concluded by moving , that the house go into a committee of supply . rose , to move that the report of the committee on Messrs. Chalmers and Cowie 's petition should be referred to the committee .
