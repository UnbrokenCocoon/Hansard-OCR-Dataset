, of the whole gross amount of 610,000l . which it was agreed , the quantity of Pig Iron manufactured would , at the rate of 40s , per ton , pro 87 duce in one year , 112,000l . would be for Government , and 208,000l . would be entitled to Drawbacks . Supposing that there were 200 furnaces , and that only one officer were to be required for each , this would produce an expence in collection at least to the amount of 20,000l . so that of the whole sum of 610,000l . only 270,000l . would remain in aid of the national revenue ; and would the noble lord , for such a sum , crush an important manufacture ? The hon . bart . thought it would be preferable at once to abandon the tax , and propose a substitute , as there would , at all events , be a deficiency to provide for by same new measure , the noble lord having taken credit for 500,000l . as the produce of the tax . did not conceive the proposed tax on the raw material as at all likely to have the effect which some gentlemen apprehended upon the higher wrought articles . The fact was , that upon the rate of , such articles the original tax would scarcely have any effect . This tax , he remarked , was opposed altogether by the representations of interested persons , and therefore not entitled to the attention which many gentlemen seemed disposed to attach to them.â€” He remembered that when the tax upon silk was raised at the rate of from 5s . to 13s . a great outcry was raised among the manufacturers , yet the fact was , that notwithstanding this increase , the silk manufactory had considerably advanced . He was not at all surprised , however , that the Iron merchants wished to shift the burden from their own shoulders to somebody else . This was no more than what was natural . could not admit , that the Excise would be so dangerous as some gentlemen supposed . It had been found the simplest and the cheapest way of collecting a tax . On the other hand , he could not admit , that , because the tax upon wood did not prevent us from building ships , it would therefore be safe to lay a tax on iron also . The fact was , that the Americans , notwithstanding the high price of labour , built ships cheaper than us . Although he disapproved of the tax , he wished the bill to go into a committee , in order to see whether it could be so modified as to be accomodated to the feelings of the manufacturers . If this modification were found practical , he would be ready to grant it that support which he would be happy on all occasions to afford to his right hon . friends on the treasury bench . Petty said , he had forborne to state his sentiments , until he heard the 88 opinions of the several gentlemen who seemed inclined to speak . It was not from pertinacity in his own opinion , that he still supported the tax , but it was from a perseverance , amidst a choice of evils , in preferring the evil of this tax to that of any other which could be supposed to be equally productive . To the proposition for substituting a tax on horses employed in agriculture he thought it unnecessary to make any other reply than that which had been already heard in the course of the debate . A tax upon the landed interest beyond their fair proportion would not , he was sure , be listened to by the house , particularly because that part of the community never manifested any disinclination to bear an equal burthen with others . To assert that the tax before the house , pressed oppressively upon this class , he thought a position that could not for a moment he sustained . For he had the satisfaction of stating
