, which troops had no existence in fact ; thus heaping demand upon demand , until the revenues of the nabob vizier became inadequate to the payment ; and having at last compelled him to make an avowal of such inadequacy , seizing upon that avowal as the ground for demanding from him a cession , in perpetuity , of one-half of his territory , as a compensation for the non-payment of the sums so unjustly , and in such direct violation of treaty , of good faith , of honour , and of honesty , demanded.—That , as preliminary to the employment of means so foul , so wicked , so unworthy of a soldier and a Briton , the said marquis Wellesley did recall from Lucknow the then resident , John Lumsden , esq. , who had assisted in the negociating of the treaty of 1798 , and , in the room of him , did , in the month of June 1799 , appoint , as resident at that court , lieut . col. William Scott , with whom the said marquis Wellesley had previously held secret consultations as to his ultimate designs with regard to Oude , and who , as it hereinafter will appear , was a representative entirely worthy of the person whom he was chosen to represent , and of the designs with the accomplishment of which he was charged.—That , with respect to the . alledged non-payment of the monthly kist ( or instalment ) as provided in the treaty of 1798 , it doth appear from a retrospective view of the several taeaties and compacts between the English company and the nabob viziers of Oude successively , that the annual subsidy , paid by that country to the company , had , in the space of 25 years , been augmented by degrees from 315,000l . to 950,000l .

That , nevertheless , the said nabob vizier did , in a manner the most punctual , begin and continue to make payment of the kists ( or instalments ) , as aforesaid , fixed and agreed upon ; that in one single instance only did he suffer to fall in arrear a monthly kist , which he immediately afterwards paid up . That from the day of the conclusion of the treaty to the day of its final abrogation by the treaty of Cession from him extorted by the said marquis Wellesley , he the said nabob vizier did , with the most perfect sincerity and the most scrupulous good faith , adhere , in word and in deed , to all and singular its stipulations and provisions ; and that , therefore , the pretences of the said marquis Wellesley , of apprehensions as to the punctual payment of the kists , were insincere , unfounded , and false , and were intended to mask the unjust , dishonourable , and perfidious designs , which he had previously formed for interfering in and encroaching upon the government of the nabob vizier , for disbanding his troops , and finally for seizing upon his territories , in defiance of the positive compact with the said
