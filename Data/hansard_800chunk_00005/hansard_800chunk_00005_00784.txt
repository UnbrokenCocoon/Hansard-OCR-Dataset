the general assets of the stock account , in which a debt of 30 millions , mostly at India interest , made so prominent a figure . The interest of that debt was a charge upon the whole concern of revenue and commerce ; and to exclude a proportion of that interest from the charges of the trade , was , he contended , contrary to the common sense and reason of mankind , whilst the admission of it totally abolished all the profit so vauntingly assumed upon the commerce at large.—Here he would ask the hon . ex-deputy chairman behind him ( Mr. G. Smith ) , who was , besides , a banker of the first eminence , his candid opinion of the stock , by computation , taken without the capital , according to the hon . ex-chairman 's statement ; and which , therefore , might be considered as the exposition of the affairs of one of his customers in embarrassed circumstances , and calling on his banker for assistance : it was only considering millions as thousands , and the analogy would be complete . Before the hon , banker advanced any considerable sum , such as 17 millions , he meant 17 thousands , he was perfectly sure the hon . banker would sit down , and minutely scrutinize the items on the credit side of this account . All the debts , he would know , must be answered , and probably to an amount beyond the statement ; but he would naturally enquire what was the nature of the assets to answer them.—Here the hon . member discussed several of the items of the stock account up to March 1805 . The first was a sum of 1,207,560l. , alledged to be due from government to the Company : this , he con- 1169 tended , was not the case ; it was a part of the national debt , consisting of consols , and standing in the name of the Company , for which they had taken credit at par , valuing them at 60 : this item was overcharged in the sum of 483,024l . Another deist of government for stores and supplies , which stood at 4,460,192l. , had been , by a special commission , curtailed in the sum of 2,089,392l . Another item , which must come against the general assets , was a charge upon the Carnatic estate , of 5,630,838l . ; under investigation , it was true , but substantiated abroad under the register of the late nabob 's creditors ; and , as he believed , still running at interest : to avoid much cavil on this item , he would strike off whatever should appear reasonable to any member of the committee ; he would , therefore , call it wily 4 millions . Here he must thank the noble lord ( Morpeth ) for his candour in producing a prospective estimate of the revenues and charges in India , for 1805 and 1806 , by which it appeared that the debts abroad on the 1st of March last , would be increased in the sum of 2,655,957l . ( and this without any provision for investment ) . —The next article was , it was true , a matter of estimate and opinion : it regarded the actual value of an item , which appeared , in the quick stock abroad , under the title of Debts Outstanding , and included advances for Investment , arrears of Revenue , Loans to Rajahs and Zemindars , ( the Guicuwah Rajah among the rest ) , to no less an amount than 9,168,000l . : but , would any man of business in the house , either financial or commercial , deny the hon . banker 's claim to a considerable allowance for bad debts under this article ? Would 2 millions he too much to deduct from this item ? The sums , therefore , to be deducted on the whole account , were £.2,000,000 483,024 2,089,392 4,000,000 2,655,957 Forming a total of £.11,228,373 Which , when set against the balance ,
