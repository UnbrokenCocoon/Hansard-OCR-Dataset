was it likely to create , if the marines on board a ship were , at the expiration of certain periods , to be entitled to advantages which were withheld from the sailors , who completed the same period of service , were exposed to the same or greater hardships and dangers , and to whom the country was so much indebted for its security and safety . It was true , that they were liable , according to ancient usage , to be dragged into the service by compulsion , without being offered any additional inducement ; but was it consistent with po- 490 licy or liberality , that this argument of peculiar hardship was to be turned against them ? If then , which he must suppose to be the case , the marines were meant to be included in the new arrangements to arise out of this system , the annual expense upon the country could not be calculated at less than three millions of money . These last observations , he said he thought it his duty merely to advert to , but not for any invidious purpose , or with the view of provoking any discussion of them at present . His lordship then proceeded to observe on the seriousness of such an additional expense upon the country : much to the credit , as he thought , of the present administration , they had in a late instance most wisely and manfully come to the resolution of raising so large a proportion of the supplies within the year , as an augmentation of 10 millions by means of an extension of the property tax , and that for time purpose of relieving posterity from the pressure of no more than half a million annually which would be sufficient to defray the interest of that sum of money ; but posterity would have but little reason to applaud the spirit and liberality of the present times , if , at the same time that we were preserving them from the pressure of half a million , we should , by this extravagant and inconsiderate system , saddle them with a burthen of three millions a-year . He then concluded with a recapitulation of his arguments , in which he trusted , that he had satisfactorily shewn , that the plan was a wanton encroachment on the prerogative of the crown ; that it could not make the army better than it was before ; that there was no ground from past experience for supposing that a limited would produce more men than an unlimited service ; that it subverted the relation in which the crown now stood with the army of the country ; that it would be injurious to the discipline of the service ; that it would create great waste , not only of the effective numbers of the army , but of that treasure also which the country could not bear if it should have to contend for its existence by the exertion of its own remaining resources ; and finally , that being fatal in all these points , it would also materially abridge the power of the crown . thought the noble lord might have been more moderate in his strictures on this plan , when some plan was confessedly necessary , and neither the noble lord himself , nor any of his associates , 491 had any plan to offer Something calculated to keep up and recruit our military force was , on all hands , allowed to be desirable ; and the only question was , as to that which was most advisable to promote the object which all professed a wish to promote . Several recommended a reliance on the ordinary recruiting alone , which , it was now evident , could not be conducted without high bounties ; but the opinion of the majority , with whom he certainly concurred , was , that limited service should be resorted to . Much encouragement to act upon this opinion was to be derived from experience . Notwithstanding the assertion of the noble lord , that all experience
