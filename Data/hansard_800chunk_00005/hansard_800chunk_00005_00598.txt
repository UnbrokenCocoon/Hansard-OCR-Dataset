, by informing them in a formal and regular manner , of what appears to us to be the truth . It will give to this valuable discovery the advantage of having all the weight of promulgation which the high character and popularity of parliament is capable of . With that view , I shall think it proper to submit a plan by which this house shall become possessed of a mass of evidence as to the real merits of this discovery ; which will prove highly satisfactory both to ourselves and to the public at large . This measure I propose to effect by the house voting an address to his majesty , praying that his royal college of physicians shall be requested to enquire into the progress of vaccine inoculation , and to assign the causes of its success having been retarded throughout the united kingdoms , in order that their report may be made to this house of parliament , and that we may take the most proper means of publishing it to the inhabitants at large . If the result of such proposed inquiry turn out ( as I am strongly disposed to think it will ) a corroboration of the beneficial effects which other nations seem convinced are derived from vaccine inoculation , it will satisfy the people of this country of the many evils which arise from the rapid progress of the other fatal species of disorder . It will prove to them that the bad effects which have been ascribed to vaccination have been dreadfully exaggerated ; and that the temporary duration of its benefits , in a few cases , have been owing to some kind of mismanagement . If such shall be the result of the proposed inquiry , I have no hesitation in saying that it ought afterwards to 883 be for this house to consider whether or not any reward has been bestowed upon the original discoverer of vaccine inoculation , which is in any degree adequate to its real importance , and as such consistent with the general character and liberality of this country . This , however , is a subject for after consideration ; but in the mean time the house will agree with me as to the propriety of collecting opinions relative to the general effects of this mode of inoculation , and to show to the world that if there be any truth as to its benefits , we shall not be the first to reject them ; but that , on the contrary , we shall use every means to encourage its progress , and this in a manner consistent with the dignity and character of our nation.—The noble lord concluded with moving , `` that an humble address be presented to his majesty , to request that his majesty will be graciously pleased to direct his College of Physicians to enquire into the state of vaccine inoculation in the united kingdom , and to report their opinion and observations upon that practice , the evidence which has been adduced in its support , and the causes which have hither to retarded its general adoption ; and that his majesty will be graciously pleased to direct that the said report , when made , may be laid before this house . —It is with much satisfaction , sir , that I rise to second the motion which the noble lord has just now made , and to take this opportunity of stating my own sentiments upon this invaluable discovery . From the time of its first publication to the world I have paid it the utmost attention , and have carefully watched its progress . I must confess that , at first , although I was perfectly disposed to admit the veracity of the celebrated discoverer himself , yet I received the accounts of its success with a certain degree of caution . I then thought that it might be attended with considerable hazard to society were we to give up practising a mode , the good effects of which had been already fully experienced , in order to adopt one which might
