period of years ; viz . from 1795 to 1804 by an account now before parliament presented in 1804 , * by which the Surplus Proceeds at home in the 10 years , amount 981,781l . From these documents it would appear , that no part of the produce of these Loans has been dissipated in the commercial transactions of the Company . Whether the may not have been employed in certain branches of them , and been invested goods or other articles for which a value remains , is a separate consideration , and will be examined hereafter . Neither is there any reason to suppose that any considerable proportion of the produce of these Loans have been sunk and expended on the defence and management of the territories . By the accounts above alluded to , it appeared that the Revenues realized in 10 years to April 1863 , Amounted to £ . 94,756,281 Actual 1803–4 13,273,044 Estimate 1804–5 13,558,509 Estimate 1805–6 14,279,533 Revenue , 10 years £.135,867,367 The Charges abroad for the same period , including Interest of Debt , and deducting Expence of Bencoolen , St. Helena , and the other settlements extra the continent of India as being rather connected with the commercial than the territorial charges , were as follows : Ten Years to 1803 £.91,416,635 Actual , 1803–4 14,748,872 Estimate , 1804–5 15,005,013 Estimate , 1805–6 16,664,672 £.137,835,192 Interest paid to Commissioners of Sinking Fund 730,000 Net Expenditure abroad 137,103,192 Revenues , 13 years 135,867,367 Charges , 13 years 137,105,192 Deficiency £.1,237,825 During the above period certain expences immediately appertaining to the territories were paid in Europe , which ought to be added to the charges . They amounted , on an average of years , to about 300,000l . per annum , or for the entire period 3,900,000l . On the other hand , the Revenues are entitled to have credit for whatever * See Vol.II . p. 1167 . 1230 sums included in the Charges abroad were disbursed on account of government , and for which the Company either have or receive payment with Indian interest thereupon , perhaps to the amount of 3,500,000l . —Upon the whole , it appeared , that during the period in question , which was one of nearly uninterrupted war , the territories had nearly maintained themselves , and consequently but a very small proportion of the sums raised by loans had been sunk in their defence.—Where , then , did the great mass of the 19,467,038l . Extraordinary Funds raised by loans since 1793 , go ? By referring to the Account of Assets abroad to April 1804 , and March 1805 at home , it would appear that a very large increase had taken place in both since 1793 . Assets in India , April 1804 14,452,343 Assets in Europe , March 1805 20,442,659 £ . 34,895,002 Assets in India , April 1793 8,339,362 Assets in Europe , March 1794 9,888,836 £.18,228,198 Assets 1801–5 34,895,002 Assets , 1793–4 18,228,198 Total Increase 16,666,804 This sum was liable to be increased by whatever proportion of the funds expended in the two subsequent years , viz . precious to April 1806 , to which the debts have been stated On estimate , had been realized in the Assets . The amount would probably be considerable , though inferior to the Increase of Debt within the period.—It then appeared , that an increase had taken place in the Assets since 1793 , to an amount nearly corresponding to that which had been made to the debt . It was plain such an immense increase could not have grown up from the commercial Profits . It was as clear , that during the period in question it could not have arisen from the Surplus Produce of the Revenues , absorbed as they had been by war : The only other possible source from which it could have arisen , was from the loans contracted within the period ; with which in amount ( without then inquiring how far it bad been invested in a description of value which could be realized or not ) it in some degree
