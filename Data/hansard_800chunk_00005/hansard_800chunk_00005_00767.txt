in general , inferior to them in point of fortune . He knew that it was unparliamentary , to impute any improper motives to members of that house ; but he must say , that if , in any other assembly , men had acted the same part as had been pursued by those of opposition ; if , on every question that could be brought forward , so much was said in praise of the volunteers , and so much had been said of certain expressions of his right hon . friend ( Mr. Windham ) , he should think , that their object was merely to catch at popularity , to win to their side that numerous and respectable body of men , and to make his right hon . friend as unpopular and as odious as they could to that body . This would have been his opinion , if a similar conduct had been adopted by any set of gentlemen out of that house ; but , in that house , he knew that it was most unparliamentary to suppose , that any member could be actuated by such motives , and , therefore , he did not impute such to them . As to the distinctions of pay , such distinctions .already existed in the regular array , and were not complained of . said , it had always been understood to be the rule , that the militia should have the same advantages as the soldiers of the line . said , he rose for the purpose of withdrawing , for the present , his motion for the speaker leaving the chair ; and moved , `` That it be an instruction to the said committee , that they have powers to extend the provisions of the said bill to the volunteers and yeomanry corps . `` â€”After the gallery had been ordered to be cleared , this was agreed to .

He did not conceive , that any injustice to individuals would result from the present bill ; although , in all great measures of policy , it was impossible to prevent some individual hardships arising from their operation . argued that , in the present case , individuals might be exempted from loss of property , without endangering the principle of the bill .
