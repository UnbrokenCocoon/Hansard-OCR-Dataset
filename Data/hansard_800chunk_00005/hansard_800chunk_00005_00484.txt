13 years we have seen that we can not supply our West India colonies without the assistance of America . To legislate upon this principle , what is it but to tell them and the world that America may do what she pleases with us . The honble gentl . a minister opposite , cheers at this idea , as if he seemed to think it a pleasing consideration that we can not exist , that is , that our colonies can not exist , without America ; that we must have her assistance or we can not supply them . Surely every man must doubt the policy of telling America this , by the solemn assurance of an act of parliament . It can not be very wise to enact laws which will have the effect of telling the Americans that we are in their hands , that they may do what they please with us , that if they shut their ports against us our colonies in the West Indies must perish . Is it wise for the legislature of this country to speak this language to America , especially at a time when some persons of considerable influence there , do not seem indisposed to quarrel with us ? But if the policy of such conduct be doubtful , what shall we say to the spirit and the dignity of it . The chosen opportunity for bringing in this bill is just upon the arrival of intelligence from America of an act having been passed there giving to the president conditional powers of shutting up their ports against our trade , according as he does or does not receive satisfaction on given points within a certain period from this country . If we by passing this act do that which is convenient to America , which seems to favour her views towards our colonies , it will be attributed to a principle of fear in this country , impressed upon our councils by this act of the American legislature , a principle of action most baneful to a state at any time , most particularly so to ours at the present , and the manifestation of which would be as detrimental to the interests , as disgraceful to the character of this nation.â€”Upon the whole then of this great question , it appears to me , sir , that we have made out these propositions : that -all the necessity for this measure arising from the fear of the starvation of the West 711 India colonies , and from the impossibility of their getting their supplies but through the means of this act of parliament , is wholly done away by our having shewn indisputably that they have been actually and sufficiently supplied , before this act was thought of ; that the loss which has been sustained in our shipping and navigation interests by the departure which has been admitted from our navigation system , has been demonstrated ; and the consequent necessity . of endeavouring to adhere to our former practice , instead of systematically and authoritatively abandoning it still further , can not , with any shew of reason , he denied ; that it is our interest to hold in our hands the power , and to shew that we possess the means of carrying the necessary supplies in our own ships to the colonies , instead of being at this particular moment obliged to acknowledge their necessary dependance on America ; and that the political consideration of the whole question with reference to our maritime strength , and the great interests depend upon that strength , and with reference to our honour and dignity in the character of our conduct and proceedings at this moment towards America ; that the adoption of this measure will be most unwise and most impolitic , called for and justified by no necessity , recommended by no utility , and under all the circumstances attending it , as disgraceful to our character , as it is useless and unnecessary to our interests ; and therefore speaking for myself , I must say , that whatever alterations
