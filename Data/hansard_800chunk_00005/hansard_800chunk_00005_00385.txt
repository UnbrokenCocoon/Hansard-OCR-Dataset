did , by the means of , and in concern with the said honourable Henry Wellesley , then , to wit , in the month of May 1802 , communicate , in writing to the said nabob , the following proposition : `` That the nabob should be `` continued on the musnud of his ancestors `` with all honour , consigning over the civil `` and military administration of the province of Furruckabad into the hands of the Company 's government.—That whatever balance should remain from the revenues collected , after paying the amount of the Company 's tribute 450,000 rupees , the charges of government , the salaries and pensions , and the expence of a battalion of sepoys to be stationed in 566 the room of the army now entertained by Khirid Mund Khan , should be paid , '' without fail , into the nabob 's treasury . '' That the said nabob , sensible of the injustice , the insolence , and tile cruelty of these proposals , and conscious of the disadvantages and dangers of his situation , unwilling to consent and not daring peremptorily to refuse , did make the following answer : — '' I have understood the proposition or delivering up the country of Furruckabad into the hands of the Company 's government I have no power to make any objections to whatever you propose : but you know the governor-general , during my minority , delivered over the country to Khirid Mund Khan as deputy : now that my minority has passed , when I was in hopes that I should be put into possession of the country and property , this proposition is made to me . I am totally at a loss `` what to do . if I deliver over the country to the English government , all my relations and my neighbours , and all the nobility of Hindustan will say that I have been found by the English government so unfit to be trusted with any management , that they did not think proper to entrust me with the management of such a country ; and I shall never escape , for many generations , the sneers of the people : if , on the contrary , I say any thing in disobedience to your orders , it will be against all rules of submission and propriety .

The balance , after paying the pensions agreeably to what was fixed by my father , to be allowed for my necessary expences . In this way your wishes may be accomplished , and my honour and name be preserved among the people . `` —That , to this proposal , so equitable in itself , and so well calculated to secure to the said East India company all that it had any right to expect , namely , the full payment of the tribute claimed by the said 567 company of the said nabob , the said marquis Wellesley , he having long and firmly determined upon the entire cession of the principality , would not consent.—That , after some other unavailing efforts made by the said nabob , for the purpose of inducing the said marquis Wellesley and the said hon .
