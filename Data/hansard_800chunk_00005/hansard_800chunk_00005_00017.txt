subject of enlisting for a term of years , or for any other military arrangement ; and those who supported the bill now proposed 25 to be repealed , entered at large into all the points of the military plan of his rt . hon . friend , as if the present bill ought not to be repealed if any fault could be found with any part of that military plan . The real state of the matter was this : that military plan , embracing as it did , a variety of points , was opened altogether by way of public convenience , that the outline of it might be seen at one view ; but it did not thence follow that none of these parts should afterwards be discussed in detail separately ; on the contrary , they must be so from their very nature . It might as well be said , when his noble friend opened the Budget , that if any objection could be started against any of the taxes , that therefore the terms of the contract of the loan were bad , or if any objection could be urged against the tax on Iron , or the Property Tax , the whole Budget of taxes must be rejected , however unconnected the rest of the taxes might be with these two . But his rt . hon . friend gave away the produce of the parish bill , because he knew that he was giving away a loss ; and this was warranted by a calculation of that produce , as would appear by comparison . He had at first stated , that the produce of the bill was nothing , he must now state that it was even less , it was a minus quantity . He would not allow that the average of the general recruiting had been fairly taken , for it could not be expected to have been the same during peace and war ; or , that during the operation of the army of reserve act it could produce as many men as it otherwise would have produced ; he should , however , state the actual increase of the army , both by the regular mode of recruiting , and by the assistance of the parish bill , at two different periods . In the months of Oct. Nov. and Dec. 1804 , 88 men only were produced by this bill , and 3058 by general recruiting . In the three corresponding months of the year 1805 there were 913 raised by the act , but by general recruiting only 2388 . On casting up these sums he must allow that the army had increased 152 men in the latter period ; but when he should compare the three months following , Jan. Feb. and March , 1805 , and compare them with the corresponding months of 1806 , he found that in the former there were 525 raised by the bill , and 3562 by general recruiting ; but in the latter period , although there were 661 raised by the bill , there were but 2517 raised by general recruiting . Adding , therefore , those sums together , it appeared there was a deficiency of 909 in the number which the 26 army had gained during the latter period . This statement appeared to him a fair comparison of the effect of the bill at the different periods ; and he should vote for the repeal , if it was for no other reason than because it was evidently an impediment to the present recruiting service of the army.â€”When the parish bill ceased to give its noxious assistance to the army , more might be fairly expected from the ordinary recruiting . Gentlemen said they had done much with their favourite bill . The child had done something ; but he had kept away the workmen . There was no gent . who could think that it was not a most desirable thing to increase the disposable force . All the arguments he had heard against the plan , did not weigh a feather
