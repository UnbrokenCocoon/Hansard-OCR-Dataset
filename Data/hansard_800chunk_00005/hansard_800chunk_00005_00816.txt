forward , the Company 's trade , as a nursery for British seamen , and deprecated the employ of India shipping , as injurious to that object . In the first place , he would ask , by whom are the Company 's ship 's now manned , and likely to be both in peace and war , while our enemy was attempting to rival us on the seas : By foreigners mostly when outward bound , and back principally by Lascars , natives or subjects of British India . Which of these classes deserved most to be encouraged he need not ask ; our commerce as now become too much the nursery for seamen of other countries , and unless care was taken hereafter , most of our British sailors would become Americans.— It was not interest , but necessity that ever induced the employ of black sailors on board the merchant ships , the greater number of them required , in proportion to the tonnage , made it always cheaper to navigate with European , and most of all with British seamen . But , if any preference was due , the British Lascar ought in policy to be preferred to Danish or American sailors.—The honourable Director had paid a just tribute to the skill and gallantry of the men who navigated the Company 's ship , and of those who commanded them . No man , said the Alderman , had an higher opinion of them , than himself , they were the best seamen and the first navigators in the world ; they had distinguished themselves against Suffrein under Watson in 1778 , and the last glorious instance of gallantry in the China seas , under captain Dance , would for ever endear them to their country . But how that establishment was supported , or merit and seniority regarded , he would not stop to enquire . In nothing , he said , was there any design to deprive the Company of their shipping , nor of that trade they were able to carry on , which trade ought to maintain its own maritime establishment.—The noble lord had fairly stated the expansion of the double system of trade and dominion , to 1216 have called for a greater amount of fixed and floating assets , than had formerly been requisite , but where among them was to be found any capital applicable to trade ? In all the Budget speeches , the surplus revenue and the product of exports were expressly mentioned as the amount applicable to investment , the rest at any rate was borrowed for the purpose , as the noble lord himself had confessed in his last Budget statement ( page 35 ) `` The question '' says he `` that will naturally be suggested on this occasion , is , as to the prudence or propriety of investing so large an amount in goods , when the surplus from the revenue is estimated so low ; as the system of providing funds for this purpose by new loans has been often objected to. '' —Mr . Dundas in 1801 had made use of these words : `` The question must naturally arise , from whence funds could be derived to meet demands to so considerable an amount , to which I shall merely now reply , that , in whatever amount the supplies from Europe in bullion and the cash received for bills on the court of directors were found deficient , money was raised on loans , as will appear in the increase of the Indian debt . `` —The Alderman here affirmed , that notwithstanding all assertions to the contrary , much the greater part , if not all that debt , had been created by the trade . The exclusive system , according to the honourable Director , embraced great political objects , it ought not therefore to be judged of on the narrow principles of a profit and loss trade ; this the Alderman observed might possibly be rational doctrine , if the revenues were able to make good the deficiencies in trade ; but , had
