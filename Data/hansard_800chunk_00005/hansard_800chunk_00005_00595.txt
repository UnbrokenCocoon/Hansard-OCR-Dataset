allow the noble lord 's statement to have been so much misunderstood by the public , as to be interpreted into an assurance , that the vast sum unaccounted for was a recoverable balance yet applicable to the public service . It was certainly a public e calling for an immediate and decisive remedy , that the accounts to so large an amount should remain above 20 years unexamined , as was the case with those of the Paymaster of the Forces . Nothing could be a greater temptation to abuse . said the paymaster was merely bound to return a list of those to whom he issued the sums drawn by him from the Exchequer ; and those persons were bound to account for what was issued to them . That had been done with very few exceptions . hoped the bill would make effectual provision for a speedy audit . He would propose a clause to that effect in a future stage . could not conceive how a delay of 20 years could have occurred in the audit of the paymaster 's accounts , if the sub-accountants had accounted regularly . in explanation stated , that the paymaster was to give in a certified list of those to whom he issued the money : the Commissioners of Audit were then to call on the persons named in this list.â€”The bill was then read a second time . moved the further consideration of the report of this bill . wished the noble lord to be more explicit in his explanation of his measure . When he proposed an increase of the property tax , the noble lord thought that no allowance should be made in it for the number of children , and now it was impossible to discover , whether he proposed this abatement in consideration of the pressure of the property tax , the assessed taxes , or the taxes generally . One thing was certain , that this would make a very great diminution , to the extent of 2 or 300,000l . in the produce of the revenue upon the permanent taxes . The assessments afforded no criterion of a man 's income , and the bill should properly state the principle on which it proceeded . The surplus of the consolidated fund was a security against any defalcations : but by this exemption , it would be considerably diminished . The noble lord found himself under the necessity of adding 1,200,000l . to the permanent taxes ; and , by this measure , he would increase the charge upon them , without having made any further provision for it . If the war should cease , the noble lord might be induced to repeal the property tax , and this deduction would operate on that part of the consolidated fund , upon which there were permanent charges . He stated his intention to propose a clause for remedying this inconvenience . remarked , that when he proposed the additional property tax , the gentlemen on the other side seemed to wish the exemptions to be continued as before ; but he thought it objectionable , as well upon general principles , as in its application to the execution of that tax . This mode also was not entirely consistent with what he conceived to be the general principles of taxation ; but he adopted it , as being less objectionable in practice than the other . He held it to be the most blameable and mischievous of all delusions , to hold out exemptions , which could not be realized , on account of the difficulties and impediments that . might be thrown in their way , which could not happen in this case . He had no objection to explain , that the principle of this allowance arose out of the general pressure of taxation upon the people of this 879 country , and he did not wish to limit it as to time , but to let it remain , while that pressure continued . It was true , that some inequalities would necessarily exist in it ; but if it were
