liberal dividend to the proprietors , might be a matter of more difficult calculation , and must , like all commercial results , be in its nature fluctuating ; but , in reasoning upon this branch of the Company 's affairs , the worthy alderman must establish several preliminary facts , before he can expect to persuade parliament that the commercial 1226 existence of the Company is to be considered merely on grounds of mercantile profit . He must be prepared to shew that individuals would be as likely to carry on steadily the commerce of India , under all the fluctuations to which such a trade is liable , where the outgoings are great , and the returns distant , as a great trading corporation . He must he prepared to dispel the apprehensions which must be entertained with respect to the injurious influence on the prosperity of India , which may be the consequence of an unsteady and unequal demand for their produce , before he can expect to satisfy parliament that an intercourse , perfectly unrestrained , is preferable to that qualified intercourse , partly free and partly restricted , which now prevails . If he assumes , that individuals by using an inferior description of tonnage , could carry on the trade at less expence , and consequently at greater profit , he must be prepared to shew , that this is not merely by throwing the difference of the expence on the publick , by rendering numerous and expensive convoys requisite to protect their feeble vessels in time of war , whilst the Company 's ships , with a comparatively slight aid from our navy , are competent to protect each other , and to set the enemy 's ships of war , even when in considerable force , at defiance . He must be prepared to shew , that such an establishment as that of the Company , could he kept up without the protection of a qualified monopoly ; or that such a system is in itself unnecessary to the political existence of the Company , and the management of large territorial revenues , when both in peace and in war Funds must be transferred through the medium of commerce from India to Europe and from Europe to India . He must also shew , before he can establish that the interest of the manufacturer at home is interested in such a change , that individual speculators would be disposed to send out British manufactures , even at some loss , as the Company have frequently done , or that there is any other limit to the amount of this description of Export , on the part of the Company , than the utmost quantity the Indian market can take off , which they have not hitherto been able , with their most strenuous efforts and some sacrifices , to carry beyond 2,000,000 a year . These , and many other important doubts must be solved , before any satisfactory or sound conclusion can be come to , on the great practical question , to which the worthy 1227 alderman , somewhat out of time , had been solicitous to point the attention of the committee . With respect to his position , that the commercial capital of the Company , properly so called , has in progress of time become inadequate to its purpose , that an accession of funds has been found necessary , and that the requisite encrease has been supplied by loans raised abroad , he had the satisfaction to agree with the worthy alderman , though by no means to the extent of his statement . Where the worth alderman found his principle , that it required four capitals , or 24,000,000l . to carry on the Company 's trade , he knew not ; certainly not from any thing he had ever said . He never had himself heard it before stated higher than two capitals and a half , or at the utmost three capitals ; but without being able to trace the precise extent of the actual increase , he was persuaded that some considerable
