occasioned by the excess above that number ; and that in the same manner , if the troops of the company of Oude , from any necessity should be less than 8,000 men , including infantry , cavalry , artillery , natives and Europeans , a deduction should be made from the annual stipend , of 76 lacs of rupees , equal to the actual difference of men below the specified number . '' And further , it was in the said treaty stipulated , with regard to security for the regular payment of the kists as aforesaid , that , `` as the payment of the company 's troops in Oude depends upon the regular discharge of the subsidy , stated in the 2d and 3d articles of the treaty , the said nabob engages to exert his utmost endeavours to 376 discharge the stipulated kists with punctuality ; but that it , contrary to the sincere intentions and exertions of the said nabob , the payment of the kists should fall into arrear , the said nabob Saadut Ali Cawn engages and promises , that he will then give such security to the company for the discharge of the existing arrears , and the future regular payment of the kists , as shall be deemed satisfactory . '' And further , in the said treaty it was stipulated , with respect to reductions of expence in the government of the nabob vizier , that , `` the subsidy to the company being now considerably increased , and many other permanent charges upon his excellency being incurred , on a comparison of his disbursements with the assets or pecuniary means of his country , it becomes necessary to make such reductions in the superfluous charges of the public establishments , servants , & c. as may be requisite , and are consistent with his excellency 's dignity and convenience ; and to that end the said nabob agrees to consult with the company 's government , and , in concert with them , devise the proper objects of such reductions , and the best means of affecting them : '' And , lastly , in the said treaty it was stipulated , as to the management of the internal affairs of the principality of Oude , that `` all transactions between the two states should be carried on with the greatest cordiality and harmony on both sides , and that the nabob vizier should possess full authority over his househould affairs , hereditary dominions , his troops , and his subjects . `` â€”That the terms of the said treaty were highly advantageous to the English company , not only as enabling them to defray almost the whole increased expence of their military establishment , and having added in perpetuity to the possessions of the company the important fortress of Allahabad , which was to be put in a state of defence at the expence of the nabob vizier , but did greatly aid the said company in their commercial concerns , as appears in a letter from the governor-general in council to the secret committee of the court of directors , dated on the 5th of March 1798 , and of which advantages the court of directors were fully sensible , as appears by their answer to the extract last quoted , of their political letter to the governor-general marquis Wellesley , dated the 15th day of May , in the year 1799 ; wherein they observe , that `` the governor-general 's minute 377 of the 5th of March , 1798 , contains a very satisfactory explanation of the variations between the terms of the previous engagement executed by Saadut Ali at Benares , and those of the definitive treaty concluded at Lucknow . By the latter , the company 's influence over the vizier 's country appears to be sufficiently preserved without the insertion of any article that might be deemed offensive ; and we have the further satisfaction to find , that , exclusive of the immediate payment of 12 lacs of rupees ( or 150,000l . sterling ) by the nabob vizier , his
