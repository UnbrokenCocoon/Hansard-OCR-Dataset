to British India , to acquire and defend which , the mother I country had made such sacrifices ; and was now in danger of being soon called on to make a sacrifice of 17 millions more ? Was I this a consideration sufficient to justify the exclusion of the rest of his majesty 's subjects from a free intercourse with the immense and populous regions , within the limits of the Company 's charter , extending 1167 from the Cape of Good Hope to Cape Horn ; while neutral flags could range at large throughout the Pacific and India oceans , and derive encouragement and support to their rising and rival commerce and navigation , from a free and unlimited access to every one of the company 's establishments , whither they carried and sold , unmolested , not only the produce of their own , but the manufactures of this country , and brought away , in return , the productions of India , to meet us in every market of Europe and America ? Not that he disapproved of their admission into the ports of India ; the silver they carried there , had afforded considerable relief to the circulation . All he had ever claimed , was , a right in British subjects , to a fair competition with foreigners in that part of the trade , which the company had neither faculty , nor inclination to carry on.—It next became necessary to enquire into the fact : he had asserted on a former evening , with regard to the means which the Company possessed , of carrying on this limited commerce , from funds of their own ; a commerce which must , from its very nature , prove ruinous , from the expensive manner in which the merchandize was conveyed in ships larger than necessary ; expensively fitted up , and constructed on principles , which diminished their capacity for stowage of merchandize , on the plea of enabling them the better to act as ships of war.—Four-and-twenty millions he had assumed as the capital required to carry on this commerce . This capital he looked for , in vain , in the account of stock by computation , where , instead of finding any capital , he repeated , and with regret , the balance , if fairly taken , was considerably against the company . In this account , exclusive of the Company 's capital , a balance was assumed of £.6,181,267 The Company 's capital actually cost 7,780,000 So that the balance £.1,598,733 was the amount which , upon their own statement , the Company were minus , —The hon . ex-chairman had argued at considerable length against this mode of stating the account , and wished to compare the joint stock of a great public and chartered company with the capital of a private partnership or individual trader : but was there any analogy between them ? The one was a public and joint stock , in which the subjects At large held transferable shares , always at 1168 market , and fluctuating in value , according to the price of money , and the estimation or credit of the Company . In the instance before the committee , this Company enjoyed privileges , guaranteed by parliament , and possessed territories , producing a princely revenue ; their stock , therefore , partook of the nature of the public securities of this country , pledged for the national debt , and was as much a public claim , as the India debt , or the bond debt of upwards of 2 millions at home . It came , by no means , under the description of the capital of tradesmen , which must always be applied to the payment of debts , before they can be deemed insolvent ; and is , therefore , properly excluded , when a statement of their affairs is laid before their creditors . In this view of the subject , he would , therefore , ask , where he was to find the 24 millions , required for trade ? where else but in
