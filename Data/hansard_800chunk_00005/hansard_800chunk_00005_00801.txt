He thought it contrary to the rules of the house , that , when the question for their determination was only respecting a single year , any member should think himself at liberty to ask all manner of questions . When the debate was disposed of , he certainly might find opportunities enough of asking the noble lord any questions he might think proper . ( the chairman of the committee ) considered that it was the custom upon India budgets , for the member who brought them forward , to take a very wide range into the general situation of the affairs of India , preparatory to moving his first resolution ; and that , therefore , it was allowed to other members , to take a considerable latitude in speaking upon that question . As to the right of asking questions , he believed the rule was this : every member had a right to put questions ; but the person to whom they were put , might answer them , or not , as he thought proper . said that , if the learned 1195 doctor wished to make a speech upon the subject himself , he should sit down with pleasure .
