, an adequate case of necessity 979 for such a breach of system , before the house will consent thus to lay the foundation of rendering our West India islands dependant in peace as well as in war , on America for their supplies , and before they will proceed thus permanently to divest the owners of British shipping of the rights long assured to them under the existing laws.—But it is said , can any one doubt of the necessity of continuing this intercourse at least in time of war , after the experience we have had of its being practised with little interruption , both throughout the last and present wars ? With respect to the commercial and maritime principles acted upon in the course of the last war , however highly I respect the authority of those who then directed our councils , and however generally wise I believe them to have been , I certainly should deprecate their being considered of universal application , or such as ought to be acted upon in all cases . Our commercial as well as our political relations at that time underwent a great convulsion ; the degree to which all the social relations of Europe were then shaken ; the attempts that were made to protect the interests of those who were attached to the ancient governments both of France and Holland , notwithstanding the hostilities we were then carrying on against those states : the efforts made to introduce our manufactures both into the countries with which we were at war , and also into their colonies , and the object we had in such a contest to concilitate neutrals by every possible forbearance , and every sacrifice on our part ; certainly at that period occasioned , and perhaps justified , great relaxation of system . It is not to be wondered at , if , upon perhaps a hasty and superficial view of the case , new indulgences should at that time , at the instance of the planters , be also granted to the colonies , namely , that of receiving for the first time supplies in American bottoms ; but we have abundant grounds to warrant us in not considering the practices which prevailed in that war , as what even those who then advised them deemed such as ought to be rendered permanent . With respect to our colonies , the correspondence since Mr. Pitt 's last return to power will prove , that his unremitting endeavours were directed to restrict the intercourse between America and the West India islands within the narrowest 980 possible limits : he had succeeded in confining the supply to lumber , and corn provisions ; and these only were permitted to be brought in under the authority of special proclamations to be issued from time to time , and to be in force only for a limited period ; but he had determined steadily to resist in future any competition with the mother country , or her North American colonies , in either fish or salted provisions . He had also latterly turned his attention , after the decisive successes of our fleets had opened to us the prospect of being able fully to protect our commerce in all parts of the world , to an early recurrence to the principles of the 28th of the king , and would , I have no doubt , if his life had been spared , soon have confined whatever intercourse was permitted to take place , to British subjects and British ships as formerly ; a regulation not more called for in deference to the shipping interest of Great Britain , than required to put an end to that system of smuggling into our colonies which now prevails to an enormous extent , particularly of East India goods , and which must continue to prevail so long as America ships are permitted to frequent our islands.— That the practice of the last war is not to be considered as conclusive in all cases may be further proved from the mortifications , which the orders in council of that period
