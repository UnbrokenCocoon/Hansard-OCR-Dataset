that been the case ? on the contrary , the Indian debt had encreased as the commerce extended , nor had the hon . ex-chairman , the noble lord , the hon . general ( Wellesly ) nor the Director himself been able to show any solid capital on which the trade had been supported ; the fact was , a trade on money borrowed at Indian interest had ruined the Company ; the Company , as he had repeatedly asserted , never had an active capital applicable to the purpose of commerce . He would state their capital : the united Company were incorporated in the year 1702 , by an indenture between her majesty queen Anne and the two East India Companies , which had previously existed on separate establishments . In 1693 the the of king William , there had been raised for this purpose by subscription , in 1217 virtue of his letter patent , on a capital of 3,200,000l . at 87½ per cent . £ 2,800,000 Of which there had been lent to government at 8 per cent . interest 2,000,000 They had also paid for dead stock under lord Godolphin 's award 400,000 which made from the first capital a deduction of 2,400,000 So that the active capital amounted only to 400,000 To which a fresh subscription was made in 170l upon 800,000l . at 155 per cent . of 1,240,000 So that the capital was then 1,640,000 But of this sum , there was lent to government the same year 1,200,000 So that the capital then remaining for trade was but 440,000 ( At this time interest was reduced to 5 per cent . ) In 1729 , a douceur was paid to government of 200,000 Unless therefore the trade had encreased their stock beyond their dividends , the capital was reduced to 240,000 In 1741 , they lent however to government , at 3 per cent . without any call on the proprietors 1,000,000 which exceeded the funded subscription afloat 760,000 At this time their loan to government amounted to 4,200,000 In 1750 , the interest on this loan was reduced to per cent . In 1789 , a new subscription of one million stock at 174 per cent . added to the Company 's resources the sum of 1,740,000 In 1793 , the capital becoming more inefficient , 1,000,000l . of stock was added , though not ail subscribed till the year after , and this produced 2,027,295 Upon this capital and the Surplus revenues , had the Company conducted dick complicated system of conquests and commerce , with what success , the committee were now the judges.—One source of loss , however , he ought to state , and that was the sale of three of the four millions which their necessities had compelled the Company to dispose of , at the market price , after the whole loan to government had been converted into Consols at 3 per cent . and the remainder , which was of no greater value than the Consols of the day , was still a resource , though at the decreased value he had before stated , in examining the stock by computation . Upon such slender means had the machine been conducted ; how far they were adequate he would not 1218 detain the committee to enquire , but a reference to the annual balances of their stock account would , in a moment , shew the progress of their affairs.—The ex-chairman had broadly admitted the Company 's present distress , and indeed to have denied the fact , would have been strangely inconsistent with his declarations in another place . The noble lord ( Castlereagh ) had also made a similar confession , but the prospect of a long peace in our provinces , afforded , in their opinion , ample confidence in the resources of the Company to surmount its present difficulties . The noble lord admitted that the India debt had afforded the capital for its commerce ; he had also corroborated the elaborate statement of the hon . general ( Wellesley ) for a peace establishment , in
