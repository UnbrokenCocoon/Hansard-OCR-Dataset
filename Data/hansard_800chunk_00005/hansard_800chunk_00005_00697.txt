enemies , or most wantonly and most barbarously slaughtered ; his towns laid waste , his forts seized , and all his possessions for ever wrested from him , and confiscated for the benefit of his avaricious , his unprincipled , and relentless destroyers.—That another of the unfortunate victims to the rapacity , cruelty , and tyranny of the said marquis Wellesley , and his unlawful agents , was the rajah Kakoor Addkeerin , zemindar of Cutchoura , a Hindu prince of venerable ancestry , of great bravery , of large possessions , the chief of a powerful and numerous body of vassals and adherents , and , for many years , a renter of very considerable districts in the Doab , under Almas Ali Khan , the great aumil of the nabob vizier of Oude.—That , conformably with the before-mentioned determination which the said marquis Wellesley had long formed respecting the humiliation of the rajahs and zemindars , and in pursuance of the before-mentioned determination which he had also formed of imposing new burthens upon the people of the extorted countries , an enormous increase of rent was imposed upon the said rajah , and very degrading concessions were exacted from him ; which , after some respectful hesitation on his part , and some imperious menace on the part of the agents of the said marquis , were agreed to : the said rajah , intimidated by these threats , `` having consented to acquiesce in any terms which might be proposed . `` —That an arrangement was accordingly made , and a settlement agreed to ; and the said rajah was about to give up his guns and ammunition , and evacuate his fort of Cutchoura , conformably to the humiliating and oppressive terms which he had been compelled to accept , when , some 1033 misunderstanding taking place in Consequence of the insolence and indignity which were offered to the said rajah , by the person who came to enforce the fulfilment of the said stipulations , and in consequence of a gross outrage committed on some of the said rajah 's people by some of the Company stroopers , the soldiers of the said rajah , justly indignant at such conduct , were unwilling to give up the fort under such disgrace , and prepared to resist.—That the commander-in-chief , with the army under his command , fresh from the slaughter of the hundreds who had fallen by their hands at Sasnee and Bidjeghur , immediately took up a position before Cutchoura , a strong and well-garrisoned fort , where the said rajah and all his family were , and made preparations for an assault—That the said rajah , anxious to soften the displeasure and avert the enmity of his assailants , and solicitous to prove his adherence to his agreements , and his submission to their will , on the 7th of March wrote the following respectful letter to the said commander-in-chief : `` In consequence of a message received from Mr. Russell , I waited upon him at Mecitchy , and accompanied him thence to Aksooly , and accepted the terms of settlement which were proposed to me for the districts of Dihooliser and Cutchoura ; and obtained leave to proceed to Cutchoura , for the purpose of sending out the guns and ammunition . I admitted the company of Sepoys , which came along with me into the fort , intending early in the morning to go to Mr. Russel with all the guns , & c. Mr. Russell came to the fort very early in the morning , and , in terms of anger and reproach , ordered me to evacuate and deliver up the fort , desiring me to go immediately , and take my people with me , and treated me with great disrespect . Perceiving this , my soldiers conceived it improper to quit the fort under such circumstances of disgrace , and prepared to resist . Just then the Sepous went away . Soon afterwards the Dewan Sooka Loll and the Mulavi arrived from Aksooly , and having restored peace to my mind , they departed .
