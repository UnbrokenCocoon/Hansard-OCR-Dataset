so glaring , that in 1800 it was found necessary to send commissioners thither , for the purpose of investigation ; but even then , nothing effectual had been done , though the most enormous abuses were found to have prevailed . Last year , an attempt was made to remedy the evil , by the appointment of new commissioners , by whom , though certainly much had been done , still not enough was done ; for though much had escaped the enquiry of the old board , yet instead of fetching up the arrears , the new commissioners were plunged still deeper in accumulation , and most enormous sums remained still uninvestigated . What idea must the house feel of the state of accounts , under the head of pay to the army , when they should be informed , that the very last account of army pay , examined by the board of accounts , was for 1782 , and that no account of that nature had been since audited : being a period of 24 years from the close of the American war . The navy accounts were also very greatly in arrear , and the store accounts lay over since the period just mentioned , without any examination ; all the expences of the last war were in the same predicament . The account of the expeditions to the Helder and to Egypt , and all the charges connected with them , as well as all subsidiary accounts with continental powers , were totally untouched to this hour . One of the great objections made against the principals in the department of expenditure , was their employment of supernumerary accountants , whom they entrusted with large sums of money for disbursement , and the progress towards examining those subordinate accounts was so tedious , that many persons had not accounted for the sums they had received until ten years afterwards , while a very large portion of them were unexamined , even to the present hour ; nor had the existing board of treasury been able , with all their endeavours for three months past , to obtain a return even of the heads of such accounts to be examined . There were , besides , accounts under the examination of the old commissioners , to the amount of 167 millions , not nearly gone through ; and also a sum of 58 millions , of which the account had not yet been explained . Add to this a sum of 150 millions , under the head of army pay , still untouched , as well as 80 millions of navy expenditure , and there would appear an aggregate sum of no less 300 than 455 millions sterling , still unaccounted for , within the last 20 years , a sum almost as great as the whole national debt . These considerations , important and impressive as they were , had already called for the most serious investigation of his majesty 's present ministers , and irresistibly argued the pressing necessity of a full investigation . He felt it scarcely necessary to represent to the house that danger to the credit and stability of the public resources , which must arise from such a circumstance as an accumulation of the public accounts for twenty years , and those the most productive in finance , and the most profuse in expenditure , that had ever occurred in any similar period of our annals ; which accounts remaining wholly uninvestigated , with the utter impossibility that must arise , from the deaths of so many individuals concerned in those expenditures , of detecting the numberless frauds , or recovering the innumerable debts that must be due to the government through defaults or peculations ; a speedy and efficient enquiry became necessary , not only for the sake of the public , but for the sake of the honest class of accountants themselves , whose situation , from their being liable to suspicion with the defaulter and the peculator , must be peculiarly distressing . It was a fact too notorious , that this enormous accumulation of unaudited
