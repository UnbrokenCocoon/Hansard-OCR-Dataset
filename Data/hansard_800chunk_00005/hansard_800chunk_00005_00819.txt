beheld ; these were the stimuli which had urged him to enter thus largely into the wide detail of the Company 's affairs , and which would continue to support him , in the further prosecution of the subject , next session , of which he had given notice in the house . in explanation said , it was impossible for him to imagine where the worthy alderman had gotten the statement which he had made to the committee of the amount or value of the Company 's exports to India , or who had furnished it , but that fortunately he ( Mr. Hudlestone ) , happened to have brought with him to the house a document on that head , for the ac- 1220 curacy of which he would pledge himself to the committee . Mr. Hudlestone accordingly read from that document , that the Company 's exports to India from the season of 1797 , to that of 1804 , amounted to 12,368,402l . giving an average of 1,546,050l . in each year . said , that the share he had borne , and the interest he must always continue to feel in the administration of India , made him desirous of troubling the committee with such observations as the course of the present debate , and the general state of the Company 's affairs at this period , suggested.—It was not necessary that he should detain them upon the detail of the accounts , which were the immediate subject of the committee 's consideration . The different results had been very fairly and clearly opened by the noble lord , and so far as the statement related to the actual accounts for the year 1803–4 abroad , and those in estimate for 1804–5 , he had the satisfaction of entirely concurring in the view his lordship had given of those accounts.—Owing certainly to no omission for which the noble lord could be responsible , but from the documents not having been received in due course from India , the committee had only now before them what ought more properly to have constituted the Budget of the preceding year , and had to regret that the information was still so much in arrear , as to deprive them of the means of forming ally very precise judgment of the present state of the Company 's finances.—Notwithstanding the defective nature of the materials , he was glad that the present discussion had taken place . It was not likely that gentlemen reasoning upon results that can only now be given on estimate , and drawing their inferences from combinations of accounts intricate in themselves , and such as can not be easily reconciled in a single discussion of this nature , should frequently find it impossible to agree in any very precise conclusion . At the same time , the debate served to bring into view , and into discussion many leading points connected with the management of this important concern , with sufficient accuracy , to be productive of practical advantage to the administration of Indian affairs . He had always considered the publick service much indebted to those gentlemen who provoked enquiry and discussion upon Indian subjects , from an intimate persuasion that it was attended with beneficial consequences both abroad and at home . Under this impres- 1221 sion of duty , he should state to the committee his sentiments upon the leading points which had been adverted to in the course of the present debate , and more particularly on the probable state of the Company 's affairs at the winding up of the Indian war , and the measures which he deemed it requisite should be taken thereupon , with a view of enabling the Company effectually to avail themselves of their general resources , in meeting the pressure of the heavy debt which had grown up abroad.—He could not but regret that in discussing the situation of the Company 's affairs , gentlemen so frequently neglected to take the obvious distinction ( which they never failed to do as a matter of course , when speaking of our affairs at home )
