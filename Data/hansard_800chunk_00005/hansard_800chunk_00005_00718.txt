they ought to be left at all times , and on which they exist at present . Neither does it appear to be necessary to increase the number of European troops , beyond the number which were in India in the year 1802-3 , in consequence of the additional territory acquired since that year . The native military establishments were fixed upon a scale , in the year 1802–3 , cal 1067 culated for the existence of peace in India ; and the continuance of the war in Europe , under the circumstances in which the enemy stands in respect to his marine , does not appear to render necessary any addition to these establishments . The actual charges of the year 1802-3 , were higher than the amount at which they were estimated and fixed , with a view to peace.—In Oct. 1802 , Holkar gained the victory at Poonah over the troops of the Peishwah and Seindeah , in consequence of which the government of Fort St. George immediately thought it necessary to assemble the troops acting under that presidency , which afterwards marched to Poonah early in 1803.—The army at Bombay was likewise placed on the war establishment ; part of it in the field ; and both armies were considerably augmented.—My noble friend ( lord Castlereagh ) has calculated the extraordinary expenses , in the last six months of 1802-3 , at 500,000l . above the charges of the peace establishment ; and in forming an estimate of the future charges of India , in a period of peace , upon the actual charges of the year 1802-3 , it is proper to strike off 500,000l . of that amount . With this sum subtracted from them , the actual charges of the year 1802-3 , together with those rendered necessary on account of the treaties of peace and subsidy , and by the acquisitions gained since that period , may be deemed fair data on which an estimate may be formed of the probable future charges of British India in time of peace . The actual Civil Charges in 1802–3 were £4,599,372 The actual Military Charges were 6,360,614 From which subtract 500,000 Remains 5,860,614 supplies for Bencoolen , & c. * 196,848 Making a total of charge in 1802–3 £10,656,834 To this must be added the additional civil charges to be incurred in consequence of the late acquisitions , of which I shall also read an estimate .
