, or difficulties of a pecuniary nature , could exist to such a degree , as to induce sir G. Barlow to conclude a treaty of which lie himself did not approve , and of which he should not think that his superiors in England would approve.—I have already said , that I was not disposed to dispute the financial statements made by the noble lord ( Morpeth ) , as exhibited in the papers upon the table ; but it must be recollected , that these statements refer to a period of most extensive warfare , which was carried on in all parts of India at the same time , and for which the preparations and exertions made were on a scale superior to any ever made upon any former occasion . There was not an officer in command of any detachment , who could prove , to the satisfaction of government , that any addition to the means already in his power would increase his capability of performing service , who did not immediately receive orders to make the increase which he required : and it will be found , that the service performed was proportionate to the expense incurred . With this recollection in our minds , it will not appear that a surplus charge , amounting , upon an average , to about two millions sterling , is very large for such a period , and for 1063 such exertions.—The subjects which require explanation in the state of the Finances of India , are—the Deficiency of the Revenues , in comparison with the Charges ( including the Interest of the Debts ) —and the great magnitude of the debts . My wish is , to shew 1st the real situation in which the Finances of India will be in time of peace ; 2d , the real state of the Indian Debt in April 1805 , ( at the close of lord Wellesley 's government , ) and in April 1806 ; and , 3dly , to compare the debt with the assets , and shew in what manner it has been incurred.—It appears by the account No . 2 , presented on the 3d of June , 1806 , page 94 , that the revenues of India , for the year 1805-6 , were estimated at 14,279,533l . ; the charges at 14,645,844l . ; the interest of the debt at 1,823,040l . ; the commercial charges , not added to the invoices , at 199.806l . ; the supplies to Prince of Wales 's Island , Bencoolen , and St. Helena , 266,800l . ; making a total of charge int 169,354,900l . ; and leaving a deficiency to be provided for by loan , of 2,655,957l . It must be observed , however , of this estimate ; 1st , that the revenues are not stated to be so high as they really are ; and 2dly , that the charges are for a period of war , in which it must be acknowledged , that they would be higher than in a period of peace . If this be the fact , it can not be , supposed to be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs , that the charges of a great empire , such as the British empire in India undoubtedly is , should exceed the revenues and resources by 2,700,000l . sterling in one year , in a period of very extensive warfare . This will be observed more forcibly , if the financial state of Great Britain , or of any other country in Europe , is adverted to.—But the duration of war ought not to be calculated upon ; intelligence of peace has already been received , and the finances in Estimate of the late Acquisitions in India , from Conquest and Subsidy , taking the Revenues at the lowest possible scale .
