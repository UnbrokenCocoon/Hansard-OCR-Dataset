corresponded.—If , then , the greater proportion of the 19,467,038l . added to the debt since 1793 , was to be looked for in the Assets of the Company , it remained generally to be 1231 ascertained how far those funds had been appropriated to purposes connected with the commercial or territorial interests of the Company . That could only be done in a very general way , but he conceived with sufficient precision for any practical purpose . He apprehended , that to neither of these sources could its application he exclusively traced , but to both in their respective proportions . The Increase on the Home Assets was greatest . It amounted to 10,553,823l. , that on the Assets abroad to 6,112,98l.—If the committee would inspect the items of which the Account of Assets consisted , they would perceive that of 20,442,659l . at home , with the exception of what was stated to be due from government to the Company , the whole was strictly of a commercial description . The Charge against government within this period was stated at 4,460,192l . which deducted from the increase of 10,553,823l . seemed to leave the increase strictly commercial to be 6,093,63l.—If the Assets abroad , amounting to 14,452 343l . after deducting the securities in the hands of the commissioners were similarly analized , the greater proportion would certainly be found to be connected with the management of the territories ; but still a considerable share must be referred to the commerce , viz . Export Goods £.1,022,007 Import Goods 1,156,228 Commercial Advances 2,131,172 Stores , in part 2,061,593 To which might be added some allowance for the share the trade might have in rendering large Balances of Cash necessary , in the various principal and subordinate treasuries abroad for the convenient conduct thereof . Supposing the same proportion to prevail between the commercial and political branches with respect to the 6,112,981l increase in the foreign Assets since 1793 , which is observable in the general account ; there would then be assignable within the period of increase , To Territories , about 4,112,981 To Commerce , about 2,000,000 £.6,112,981 If , then , to the increased Commercial Assets at home , viz . 6,093,631l . were added the proportion of the increased assets abroad , which might be deemed commercial , viz . 2,000,000l . the whole commercial increase would be 8,093,631l . since 1793 , which 1232 might be taken to be about the proportion of the Debt which had been contracted for purposes directly or indirectly connected with the commerce , and to have been gradually invested in a larger and more valuable stock of goods and stores on hand both abroad and at home ; in a commerce more enlarged , as well as necessarily conducted at a considerably increased advance of capital ; and also in an extension of the buildings and other establishments connected with this branch of the Company 's service . —Deducting the amount which appeared to have been thus realized in the Commercial Assets from the gross Increase of Debt , there was some reason to presume that the residue had been raised and applied to services either connected with the territorial government or the service of the state at home , Gross Increase of Debt since 1793 £.19,467,038 Assignable to Trade 8,093,631 Remains 11,373,407 Deduct Claims on Government 4,460,192 Remains £.6,913,215 The latter sum , liable to be increased by whatever proportion of the Claim on government is disallowed , may be deemed , upon grounds of general reasoning , the proportion of the Debt incurred since 1793 assignable to the territories , about 4,000,000l . of which may be found in the territorial assets abroad , having been invested partly in increased Cash Balances , partly in larger sums floating between the presidencies , as well as between the sub-treasuries within each presidency , partly to advances to native powers , or their creditors , as for instance , the advance on account of the Carrnatic Debt , the Loan to the Guicowar , & c. The advances on account of the public , he did not
