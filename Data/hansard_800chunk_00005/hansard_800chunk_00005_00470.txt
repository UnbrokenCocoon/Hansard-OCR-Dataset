being granted , from the gigantic efforts of our enemies for the destruction of our trade in this war : what answer has been given by the admiralty to the question to them respecting convoys before I left the committee for trade I can not tell ; but after the almost total destruction of the naval power of all our enemies , I did not expect to hear any dread expressed of their gigantic efforts on the seas ; I certainly entertained a hope that one of the good consequences of our great and brilliant naval victories would be a facility in protecting our trade in every part of the world.—I can not be less anxious than the noble lord , or any other member , that there should be no uncertainly or fluctuation in the supplies to the colonies in the West Indies , as I have as deep an interest there , in proportion to my whole fortune , as most men in this country ; many of my nearest connections 691 have also considerable property in them : that consideration , however , can not turn my attention from other interests both of a public and private nature ; but let me not be understood to take any great merit to myself in that respect , because I am acting under a conviction that the islands would be as regularly as regularly and as well supplied in British ships , as they ale now even in time of war , if convoys can be furnished . In time of peace nobody can doubt it ; experience has put that matter completely out of doubt . I trust , therefore , the right hon . gent . ( Mr. Fox ) will reconsider his opinion of the probable necessity for relaxing our navigation laws in peace , as the promulgation of it may do incalculable mischief if uncontradicted It we look to the effect likely to be produced by this measure to our continental colonies , we shall not find the ground of objections weaker : the system which has been pursued since 1784 , has been nearly as mischievous to these as to our navigation ; instead of advancing rapidly in cultivation as they were doing previously to that time , that has been checked , and their trade with the West Indies has fallen off very considerably , as appears by the accounts on your table . This evil is the more serious , and should be the more guarded against , as in the event of a breach with America , it is on our remaining settlements on the continent that the West Indies must principally rely for their supplies.—On looking on this bill apparently so simple in its provisions , gentlemen are not aware how many important interests are likely to be injured by it . The American ships which supply our islands with lumber and provisions , do not confine themselves to these articles , nor indeed does this bill restrain them to such ; they have been in the practice , as we have learned from the governors and naval commanders , as well as from seizures made of cargoes to the islands , great quantities of East India piece goods , ( which from the superior advantages they have in the Indian trade they can afford much cheaper than the British merchants ) , as well as German linens , not only for the consumption of the islands , but for the free-port trade with the Spaniards . It has been said that British ships may do this as well as foreigners , but experience has proved that they did not do so ; nor is it likely they should : American vessels in that trade are chiefly of small burthen , and can more easily escape than large shins , and there is a further security against such practices British ships , as they may be followed 692 and seized on subsequent information.—The Irish provision trade is also entirely overlooked by this measure . The Americans , who had in some of the islands been materially checked , and in
