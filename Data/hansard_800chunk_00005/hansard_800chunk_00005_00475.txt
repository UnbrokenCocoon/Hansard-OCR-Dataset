, the house will upon reflection be of opinion that there will still remain objections in principle , which will render it extremely unwise to pass this bill in any shape whatever.â€”An hon . baronet ( sir F. Baring ) whose authority on mercantile subjects stands ( in this house as well as every where else ) extremely high , has given us to understand , that he is decidedly of opinion , that the ship-owners of this country who oppose this bill are desiring to have the monopoly of a trade which , if they had 698 that monopoly , they could not carry on : that the trade which they seek , and which they say they are ready and eager to enter into , is actually impracticable . Now , sir , with all the respect and deference which I most unfeigned feel for the opinion of that worthy baronet , and without pretending to have an opinion of my own worthy to be mentioned with his upon any commercial question , can not forbear from remarking , that this is only opinion against opinion , and judgment against judgment , not mine against his , for that I should not have the presumption to state , but the opinion of great , intelligent , and wealthy merchants of this city , against the opinion of the worthy baronet ; and these merchants , thus qualified to judge , give this pledge of the sincerity and strength of their conviction , that they declare themselves ready and willing to embark in this very trade , and risk their interests on its success : and , I am confident , that however valuable and deseryedly eminent the opinion of the worthy baronet is upon this subject , yet the house must feel that it would be too much deference to be paid to any opinion , and I am persuaded that no person would be more sorry than the worthy baronet himself , that such deference should be paid to his , if the house should rest , so far satisfied with the authority of that opinion , as to preclude any body of men in this country from having a full investigation of a subject so into resting to them , before any final decision upon it was adopted . What I wish is , that this point may be investigated by , a committee nominated by this house , in order that we may be enabled to judge between the two opposite opinions , and to determine whether those who are concerned in the trade , who are acquainted with it , who are disposed to embark their property and their interest in it , have formed the true opinion , or whether the hon . baronet is right in his ? the hon baronet , had he been in the house on a former night when this subject was discussed , would have heard on behalf of those who oppose this bill , merchants in the city of the most respectable character , and of the first intelligence , a declaration that they were now actually engaging in this trade ; that they had actually taken up shipping for the purpose of carrying it on ; nay , that in so doing they were not engaging in any new untried speculation , but were merely revelling back to their former trade ; that they had done the same before , had taken these voyages , had carried on that very 699 trade which the hon . baronet deems impracticable , and were now disposed to embark in the same again , provided that such protection should be given to it as they asked ; provided convoys should be afforded to them ; provided that facility of opening the ports to neutrals Inch had lately obtained , should no longer be continued ; and that the trade should be properly secured to the British subjects , under these circumstances . All we intreat is , that the house should not be hurried on with such precipitate and eager haste , without a pause for enquiry upon
