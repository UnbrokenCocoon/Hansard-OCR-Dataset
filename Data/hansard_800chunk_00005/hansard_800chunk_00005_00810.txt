which the argument could apply . Several other expeditions were projected , in which the East India Company had no more interest than any other corporate body : such expenditions indeed , by withdrawing their troops from the continent of India , and carrying them to unhealthy climes , are worse then useless to the Company ; they occasioned however a large expenditure , for the whole amount of which the Company have a just claim on government , as I shall at all times be prepared to prove , but amount , large as it is , forms but a small part of the enormous increase in our Indian expenditure and debt.—The peace of Seringapatam concluded with Tippoo Saultaun by lord Cornwallis , was signed the beginning of March 1792 , and from the period till the year 1798 , the peninsula of India was undisturbed by war ; but when the noble lord spoke of 13 years if war , as if Indian debt had been progressively encreasing each of those years , he must have , forgotten the decisive fact , that , in 2 of the first 6 years , the Indian debt , instead of encreasing , diminished ; viz . that in 1794 , it 1207 was less by upwards 700,000l . than in 1793 ; and in 1795 , upwards of 500,000l . less than in 1794 , and that in 1796 , tho ' a little more than in 1795 the debt was still nearly 900,000l . less than in 1793 , when , as is well known to the noble lord , its amount was 8 millions ; from that year ( 1793 ) to 1798 , the increase was only 3 millions ; it then we suppose with the noble lord , that the 5 intervening years were years of war , what does that fact express with regard to the expenditure of the succeeding 7 years ; viz . from 1798 to 1805 ; during which , according to the estimate on the table , the Indian debt has accumulated from 11 millions to 26½ millions ? for although the noble lord spoke of 13 years , which must include the present year , I imagine his meaning went to no later period than to April 1805 , which is the latest to which the usual estimate of the Indian debt is brought up but if the noble lord wishes to bring it up to the present time , I fear several millions must be added to that estimate . The committee will judge therefore whether the present embarrassed state of the Company 's finances can with accuracy be ascribed to 13 years of war , and it is at least highly important and just that the committee should be aware , that of the 18½ millions added to the Indian debt since the year 1793 , three millions only , were contracted before the year 1798.—That this enormous increase in the Indian debt has been principally occasioned by the late war in India , there can he no doubt , but it war alone could produce so great a change in the state of our finances , what would have been our situation after the war which began in 1779 , and ended in 1784 , in which we had to contend in India with the French and the Dutch , the Marattas and Hyder Ally ? between which too and the late war there was this striking difference , viz . that our own districts were the seat of war , and by far the greater part of the Carnatic for a considerable time in the possession of the enemy ; yet , at the conclusion of that war , the Company 's debt in India , I believe , amounted only to 6 or 7 millions . Whereas the late war in India was carried on in the territories of the enemy , and our own felt none of its calamities , except that during a few weeks an adventurer , named Dundeah , committed depredations in shore of the Mysore districts . This is well
