of facts of your own making to general principles , and to apply general arguments to that statement ; and , therefore , I distrust all general arguments when applied to this case ; and for this reason , because I remember that the very same arguments , and the very same answers were made , word for word , for this trade , as now contended for , in time of peace , that are now made in time of war . There is not one syllable said this day in time of war , that was not advanced in the year 1784 , to shew that the opening of this trade was necessary ; that is to say , that it is as necessary in time of peace as in war time ; a proposition which ministers , whatever they may wish , have not yet thought fit to go the length of contending ; but their arguments , and so must all general arguments , go that length . The very language of the hon . baronet is to be found in the answer which was made in the year 1784 : the noble lord and the hon . baronet have said , they thought it extraordinary that British shipping could be capable of carrying on this traffic , under all the circumstances of this trade ; so it was said in as many words in the year 1784 , that the trade for the supply of your colonies can not be carried on , by reason of the circuitous voyage which the British ships are obliged to take ; and that you are at once obliged to come to the direct American trade in American ships . But my noble friend over the way , ( lord Castlereagh ) stated the ground of what was offered to be done in 1784 , and of the non-application of it to this case ; when the necessity of the measure then attempted appeared upon the very face of it ; there was therefore , no necessity for enquiry into the particular facts on which the measure was founded ; it grew out of the situation , the particu- 992 lar situation , in which things were placed by the American revolution ; and this shows the impropriety of the application of the argument of the noble lord who spoke last ; who referred , by way of justification of the present measure , which he proposes for the adoption of parliament , to another measure which had been proposed , indeed , and offered too : but which had been rejected by parliament ; ( alluding to the draft of a bill penned by Mr. Pitt , which had been referred to by lord H. Petty , and partly quoted by him ; ) and that measure was supported by much the same arguments as the present is attempted to be supported ; say attempted , because now the futility of the system is exposed . It was then said , `` there is no danger from this ; let America remain on the footing on which it stands ; let its trade go on in its old channel ; it will find its level , and can never hurt us . '' Why , sir , this was all very plausible general reasoning , but had no specific application to the plain matter of fact of the case ; because , it was well known , that it would injure the trade of this country , and , with that sense of it in the opinion of those who were best qualified to form one , the proposed measure was a bad one , it was opposed by the general , and almost unanimous voice of the country ; and for that very good reason , no attempt was made to carry it into execution . So far from it , that the very first measure which the privy council adopted , was a measure of restraint to prohibit it , and they then expressed their opinion , upon deliberation , to be , that this was
