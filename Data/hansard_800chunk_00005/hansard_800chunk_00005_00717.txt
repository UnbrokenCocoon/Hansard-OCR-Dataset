In the year 1802–3 , the company were in possession of all the territories which they possess at present , excepting the territories acquired by the treaties with the Guickwar , and by the treaties of Bassein , and of peace concluded with the Mahrattas , in Dec. 1803 . The produce of that year will form the fairest datum from which an estimate may be formed of the probable future resource . An average of any number of years can not be taken ; because , in 1801 , the provinces in Oude were not in the company 's possession : because , in 1803-4 , there existed a drought in all parts of India , which affected particularly the produce and revenues of the ceded provinces in Oude , and in some degree those of the provinces ceded by the Nizam on the Toombudra and Kistna rivers , and those in the Carnatic ; —and because , in 1804-5 , the revenues of the ceded provinces in Oude must have been affected by the incursion of Holkar 's armies.—The amount of the revenues in 1802-3 will afford an estimate of what they will be in future in time of peace ; although there is reason to believe , that they will considerably exceed that amount.—The Revenues in India in the year 1802–3 , as appears by the accounts before parliament , were 13,464,537l . To this sum , in forming an estimate of the future probable resource of the government in India , must be added the new subsidies , and the revenues of the British territories gained by the company since the year 1802-3 , of which I will read an estimate : 1065 WEST OF THE JUMMA Agra , exclusive of the Pergunnahs , Dholepore , & c. at first reserved to Scindeah , and now ceded to the company 10,64,255 Districts settled by the resident at Delhi 4,25,594 Syer of Delhi , & c. 1,83,689 Districts unsettled , suppose 4,25,000 20,98,538 Deduct 20 per cent . as above 4,19,707 16,78,831 In Hindustan rupees of sorts 54,89,664 52,70,076 CUTTACK 13,51,405 Deduct 20 per cent . as above 2,70,281 Arcot rupees 10,80,124 10,37,879 BROACH 10,00,000 Deduct 20 per cent . as above 2,00000 Estimated equal to Sonat rupees 8,00,000 8,00,000 Total of Revenue of rupees of sorts 73,70,788 Ditto in Sonat rupees 71,07,955 Sicca rupees 66,81,478 Or , pounds sterling 835,184 SUBSIDIES .

It does not appear , however , that the establishments of European troops in particular , were reduced to a lower scale than that on which 1066
