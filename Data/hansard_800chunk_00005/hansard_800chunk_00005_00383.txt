territory , either by wars , negociations , or intrigues having , in open defiance of the solemn resolutions of the commons of Great Britain , and of two successive acts of parliament , which declared , that `` to pursue schemes of conquest and extension of dominion in India are measures repugnant to the wish , the honour , and the policy of this nation ; '' having , in violation of every principle of equity , and of all good faith ; and having , under the most unjust pretences , and by the mast iniquitous means , extorted from the said nabob vizier of Oude a large 563 portion of his dominions and revenues , did , among other branches on the said revenues , extort from the said nabob vizier , his claim , right , and title for ever , to the annual subsidy which the said nabob of Furruckabad had , by the agreement made with the said nabob vizier as aforesaid , bound himself to pay to the said nabob vizier , for the protection and defence of him , the said nabob , and his principality of Furruckabad.—That the said marquis Wellesley , not contented with having thus seized upon the tribute aforesaid , did , about the same time , in opposition to the before-mentioned guarantee of security which had been given by the said East India company to the nabob of Furruckabad in opposition to the before-mentioned agreement which the said East India company had made not to interfere in the affairs of Furruckabad ; in opposition to the aforesaid prohibition of the said East India company ; in opposition to the aforesaid resolutions of the commons of Great Britain , and to the aforesaid acts of parliament ; and , in opposition to all right and justice , conceive the intention , and form the determination of wresting from the aforesaid nabob the whole of his authority , his government , his revenues , and his territory : which unlawful and wicked intention he did , without the knowledge or consent of the council , through the agency of , and in concert with , his brother the hon .
