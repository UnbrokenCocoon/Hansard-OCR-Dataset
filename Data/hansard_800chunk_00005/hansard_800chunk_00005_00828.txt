With this view , he was of opinion , that it would be desireable to charge a special committee sitting above stairs , with the task of investigating and reporting upon the present state of the Company 's finances in all its details . If such an enquiry was instituted , not with any hostile or indirect view of shaking the Company 's rights , or of innovating on their existing constitution , but with a sincere and candid desire to remove doubt , and to throw light on such points as were disputable in their financial system , he was persuaded the result would be highly advantageous to their general credit , and that a report coming from such authority would go far to prevent the publick mind from being hereafter misled with respect to the true state of the Company 's affairs.—He was the more desirous that such an enquiry should be instituted , as he did not conceive , upon any grounds less grave and satisfactory than an investigation before a committee of their own members , that parliament would feel itself authorized to lend its aid to the Company in carrying into effect those vigorous measures winch could alone , in his judgment , afford an early , adequate , and effectual relief to their finances , the nature of which relief he should now lay before the committee ; first , however , shortly explaining the actual state of their affairs , as calling for and recommending such a measure.—The Company 's Debt in April 1802 , to which debt the plan of liquidation which he had the honour of opening to parliament in March 1803 was applied , amounted to 18,654,381l . of which about 16,000,000l . bore interest . The Debt up to April 1806 was estimated at 28,500,000l . of which about 25,000,000l . might he considered as bearing interest . The annual Interest in the former period was 1,394,170l . In the latter , it would somewhat exceed 2,000,000l , The Surplus Revenue was estimated in March 1803 at 1,053,000 , exclusive of 80,000l . interest payable on debt redeemed . By the actual 1235 accounts of 1802–3 the surplus , notwithstanding 500,000l . additional charge occasioned by assembling towards the close of the year the armies on the Mahratta frontier , amounted to 7,97,000l . which would have given a surplus of 1,297,000l . in that year , had this armament not taken place.—Calculating upon some further military reductions then in contemplation , and about 120,000l . a year which had since accrued to the revenue of Fort George from the fund antecedently appropriated to the Carnatic Creditors , had we remained on a peace establishment , they Surplus at this day , independent of savings from reduction of interest , would probably not have fallen short of 1,500,000l . Out of this Surplus , the Charge of Interest on Debt since incurred , must be defrayed . Taking this at 700,000l . the surplus likely to be forth-coming upon our return to a peace establishment , might then be estimated at about 800,000l.— This corresponded pretty nearly with the view which his hon . friend ( sir A. Wellesley ) had taken of this part of the subject ; in which , after estimating the revenues from the late conquests and cessions at 1,200,000l . and the additional Charges of the same at nearly a like sum , he reckoned upon an annual surplus of 700,000l . when all the reductions were completed , exclusive of the interest payable on debt redeemed amounting to about 250,000l.—It would certainly be too sanguine to estimate the Surplus , upon the most favourable hypothesis , at more than 1,000,000l . It would not be necessary to waste many arguments in order to satisfy the committee , that to contend successfully against a debt of 28,000,000l . a more effective surplus is indispensable , and they must at once perceive that the Plan of Reduction which was framed in 1803 to meet a debt of 18,000,000l . must be comparatively feeble and inadequate as applied to the debt augmented us it now is
