this measure is at an end , as that necessity is shewn not to exist . Then comes the consideration whether or not policy demands , or even admits of this measure : or whether the impropriety of continually submitting to the breach of the law , continually recognizing that breach , and continually indemnifying it , as has certainly been the case , is not so objectionable as to outweigh the objections which can be urged against the bill which is now proposed ? Now , sir , as I have said already , I am perfectly willing to admit that as a general proposition ( but not applicable to the state of our colonies ) it is as unfit to continue the law in such a state , as to make the breach of it 705 necessary : and that it is better to suspend or relax it , when you can reasonably anticipate the necessity of breaking it . As a general proposition , I say again , I am ready to admit it . But the question here is , first , whether it is a proposition which is true , as applicable to the particular situation of the colonies , with respect to the navigation laws ? and another question naturally arising out of the first , is , whether it is wise to act upon that proposition , supposing it to be generally true at the present moment ? Upon the first question , it must be remembered , that the main ground on which it is contended that authority should be given to the privy council , instead of suffering the power of relaxing the laws of navigation , and the power of opening their ports to remain with the governors of the islands , as it has done of late , is this : â€”That the situation of those governors , their constant , daily and familiar intercourse with the planters , who are naturally led to seek the cheapest mode of supplying the islands , exposes thorn to exaggerated statements of the necessities of those islands , and to a pressure from the importunity of the planters which is almost irresistible . But I apprehend the arguments from the importunity to which the governors are exposed , shews the necessity of making it more difficult for them to yield to it , and of protecting them from the effect of that importunity , rather than the propriety of making it more easy , by vesting them with the discretion which this bill through the privy-council would give them . At present the governor , if he suspends these laws , must suspend them under his own responsibility ; he must be able to justify the violation of the law , by making out a strong case of necessity ; and the noble lord seems to think that this is highly improper , for that the governors of the West India islands can know nothing of those various matters , the consideration of which ought to govern the decision of the question , whether our ports shall be opened to foreigners or not ? that they can know nothing of the state of the market here , of the general circumstances of Europe , of the state of convoys , of the prudence of our ships sailing for the islands ; of their readiness to sail ; of what they are about to carry with them to the supply of the islands : and that all these things are known only , or best known to the privy-council ; that a governor of one of the West India islands can know nothing of them . Now , sir , he certainly can not know much of any of these matters ; but he knows that which is more valuable for the 706 present purpose than all the rest put together ; he knows the state of the island that seeks to be relieved for want of supplies infinitely better than the government at home ; he knows its wants , and possibly the means of its relief , which government here can
