then he did not see any mode that could .answer the purpose , except this vigorous prosecution of the business , which must be conducted in the absence of many members who would wish to be present . There might also be another objection to this point of form . But , however , we had only now to proceed with the evidence for two or three days ; and if it was likely to go to any length , then it would be necessary to adopt some new and extraordinary course ; for he felt that it was necessary , in justice to the accuser and the accused , that the house should come to some decision this session . The hon . gent . who conducted this affair , must feel delay extremely unpleasant , though he certainly was not responsible for the delays of the house of commons ; and , on the other hand , it would be dreadful to keep the accused and his friends in suspence . He thought , therefore , that we should begin directly , and proceed with as much dispatch as the forms of the house would allow . the house then resolved itself into a committee , to consider of the charge , lord Folkestone in the chair . The chairman first desired the serjeant to call lord Teignmouth . Mr. Paull then said a few words , which we could not distinctly hear , relative to the introduction of a short-hand writer .
