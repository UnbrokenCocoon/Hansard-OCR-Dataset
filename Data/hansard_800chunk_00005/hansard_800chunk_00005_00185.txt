raising men but money ; and he would appeal to the papers on the table , whether or not his apprehensions had been well founded . He claimed no merit for peculiar discernment upon this ground , for many of their lordships entertained originally the same apprehensions ; but , however unwilling he was now to trespass on their lordships ' time , he felt it necessary to dilate a little in the examination of the measure itself , and its real operation , comparatively with the objects to effect which it was proposed , and to shew whether it had tended most to impede or promote the recruiting service . The original object , as he had already stated , was to supply all the deficiencies arising from any other mode of recruiting for the time ; to aid which purpose permanently , it was proposed gradually to diminish the militia to its original amount of 40,000 men . At the time this bill passed , the whole number of men deficient from the proposed force of the country , was about 26,000 , who were to be almost immediately made good by the bill . But from the beginning of Oct. 1804 , when it came into operation , until the 24th of the same month in the following year , the number of men raised was but 1834 , leaving a deficit of 24,900 , and an amount of penalties incurred by the parishes , no less than 481,800l . It might be said the bill was not then in full operation , and , indeed , it must be remembered , that for a considerable time it was almost forgotten ; but , notwithstanding the subsequent exertions that were made to render it produc- 272 tive ; the circular letter addressed by a noble lord ( Hawkesbury ) to the lords lieutenant of counties on the subject ; the mission of inspecting officers , and recruiting-officers , to instruct parish-officers , to teach them how to understand the bill , and tutor them in the trade of recruiting ; still was its operation found so utterly defective , even up to the 18th of April last , that there were then deficient of the number of men proposed to be raised , no less than 21,458 ; and a sum of penalties incurred by the parishes throughout England and Wales , to the amount of 442,320l . ; besides a sum already enforced , to the amount of 39,420l . In those estimates which included England and Wales only , he feared he was not quite correct ; but certainly rather under than over the full amount ; and if he included Ireland , then the total deficiency in the force of both countries , which the measure proposed to supply , would be 41,455 men . In support of these statements , the noble lord went into a minute detail of extracts from the documents on the table , and shewed the progressive deficiency of men , and growth of penalties , in successive periods of 6 months ; he also compared the number of recruits raised for the line by the ordinary modes of recruiting in use before the passing of the bill , with the progress of recruiting under its pretended aid ; from which he argued that , from the 1st month the bill came into operation , the general recruiting service , instead of advancing , had considerably and rapidly diminished ; that , in fact , instead of being a measure of aid to that service , it was a ruinous impediment ; that it imposed a duty upon a set of men , the parish-officers throughout the country , totally inconsistent with their habits , and which , in the first instance , it rendered utterly impossible for them to perform ; for it expressly limited them to three-fourths of the bounty offered within their districts by recruiting-officers for the line . The parishes too were punished by a penalty of 20l . per man , for those deficiencies which the bill rendered unavoidable ; and thus threw an
