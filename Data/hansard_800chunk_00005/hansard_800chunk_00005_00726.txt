's government , as before stated , a sum of 1,200,000l . on the revenues of the Carnatic , with interest ; which debt was incurred in a former period , previously to lord Wellesley 's arrival . The mode in which this debt was incurred is as follows : —The registered creditors , under the act of 1784 , had a right to certain portions of the annual payments made to the company by the nabob , under the treaty concluded with that prince by sir A. Campbell.—In the year 1791 , lord Cornwallis assumed the nabob 's countries , and applied all the revenues to defray the civil and military charges of the company . The creditors applied for payment to the company , and the decision was not passed upon the subject till after the year 1798 , when the principal which had been due in 1791 , with interest calculated to that period , was added to the company 's bonded debt of Fort St. George.—But there is another view which may be taken of the debt of 27,722,391l. , which is supposed to be due in India , on the 30th April , 1806 ; 16,669,745l . of which have been incurred since the 30th of April , 1798 . The assets in India , in April , 1798 , were £9,922,903 In April 1806 , supposing them the same as in April 1804 , they were 17,952,299 1080 Increase of assets in that period is 7,229,493 Subtract the increase of assets , from the amount of the increased Debt since 1798 , and the remainder will be 9,440,252 Which is the net increase of Debt . Set-off against the net increase of Debt the sum of 3,147,725 being the sum applied to investment , to supplies to China , and to his majesty 's and to the company 's chartered ships , beyond the amount of the exports and supplies from Europe , and the result will be , that the debt incurred in India , on account of civil and military establishments and services of all descriptions , including the Egyptian expedition , is 6,292,527l . in eight years , from April 1798 , to April 1806.—This view is liable to the same exception as the former , on account of the errors in the accounts of the assets ; but the error is not of very great magnitude . In this account of debt , supposed to have been incurred on account of political expenses , is included the amount of supplies to Bencoolen and St. Helena , which , in the six years from 1798 to 1804 only , amount to 1,096,736l . Upon a review of the accounts which have been laid before parliament , at different times , it appears , that large sums have been expended in India , for services chargeable to his majesty 's government ; the Egyptian expedition was carried on at the expense of the company ; and expenses have been incurred in India on account of expeditions against the Danish settlements , and of their capture ; for all of which expenses , the company have a claim upon the public.—But as these expenses have been incurred in India , and have been a charge upon its revenues , the amount allowed for them , and paid , or to be paid to the company , ought fairly to be set off against the amount of the debt , as well as the sums advanced to his majesty 's ships , and for the government of Ceylon already noticed . There are other sums also which now constitute a Part of the debt in India , the value of which the company have received in England . The total charge of the Molucca islands , during the time they were in the possession of the British government , ought to be carried against the home concern in the analysis of the debt in India ; as nearly the whole of the produce of the Moluccas was sent home , and sold for the benefit of the East-India Co.—After this view of the Debt
