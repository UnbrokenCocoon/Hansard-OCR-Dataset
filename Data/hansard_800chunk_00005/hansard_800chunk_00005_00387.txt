off from his relations , his friends , his subjects , and his country ; beguiled into the territories of his enemy ; surrounded on every side by British troops ; in every respect defenceless and powerless , having no where to resort for assistance ; seeing his ancient ally and protector , the nabob vizier of Oude , stripped of half his possessions , by the very persons in whose power , and at whose mercy , he then was , and reduced to a state of vassalage to the very persons who were then dictating terms to himself ; seeing his powerful minister Khenud Mund Khan , the regent , in the interests of his enemies ; and seeing , in those enemies , those perfidious friends to whom himself and his house had ever been invariably attached , and who were bound by every human tie to succour and uphold him ; and knowing that any sort of opposition , on his part , would be utterly ineffectual and unavailing , and would only ex- 569 asperate the bitterness of hisfoes , was obliged to submit—That , in this unlawful , wicked , and cruel manner , did the said marquis Wellesley , in open violation of the most sacred ties , of the positive orders of the East India company , of the solemn resolutions of the commons of England , and of two successive acts of the British parliament , insult , injure , oppress , despoil , and , in fact , depose , a young , defenceless , and friendly prince , extorting from him all his revenues and his dominions , and reducing him and the whole of his illustrious family to a state of vassalage and dependency : and , thus , did the said marquis exhibit the British government to all India and the whole world , as a government totally wanting in justice and good faith , openly despising the law of nations , guided by no principle but that of gain , and undisguisedly scoffing at all right but the right of the sword.—That in all and singular the above recited acts and proceedings , the said Richard Colley marquis Wellesley has been wholly unmindful of the solemn engagements of duty to the said East India company , to his sovereign , and to his country , by him entered into ; has daringly contemned the parliament , the king , and the laws , and dishonoured the British nation and name ; and has therein been guilty of high offences , crimes , and misdemeanors . '' The charge was ordered to printed , and taken into consideration on the 19th inst . The house having resolved itself into a committee of ways and means , observed , that after what had been already said on the subject to which he was now to call the attention of the house , it would be unnecessary for him to trouble the committee at any length . He need do nothing more than state , that , according to the intimation which he had given on a former occasion , it was proposed to raise 10 per cent . on the amount of the assessed taxes . He would accordingly now move a resolution to that effect . With regard to the other motions which he had to submit to the house , it related to the exemptions which it was in contemplation to allow to persons having small incomes and large families . The object of it was to allow a deduction of four per cent . for every child , in cases of assessment under the amount of 401 . As far as the ratio extended , this would apply to incomes up to the amount of one thousand , or between one and two thousand pounds . This would 570 embrace the whole of the exemptions that could have been claimed on this account , under the property-tax , and besides , it possessed the advantage of being more full , general , and permanent , the exemptions under the property-tax being necessarily temporary .
