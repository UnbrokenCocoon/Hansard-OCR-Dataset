commercial charges paid there , which were not included in its invoices ; 1155 and for loss on the sales of exports thither . The exchange was , as usual , at 2s . per current rupee , 2s . 3d . the Bombay rupee , and 6s . 8d . the pagoda . The bills drawn by India and China were debited ; the sums received from government in England , for the expences of military expeditions from India , were credited.—Again , by a new account , which he had caused to be made up between India and China , on the one hand , and England , on the other , for 10 years , from 1793–4 , to 1802–3 , The total amount of supplies to India and China were £29,531,583 The total amount of political payments in England , on account of the territory in India , was 3,743,028 Both £33,274,611 Total amount of receipts from those countries £33,903,574 Ditto in England , on the account of India 1,599,586 Both 35,503,160 Excess of receipts from India and China , in this peroid £228,549 The causes of this difference of Result , in the last period of 10 years , appeared to be these : In the first period , from 1788–9 to 1792–3 , the imports from India and China were proportionably less £752,008 Payment to government at home , more 500,000 Difference of political charges , more 842,661 £2,094,669 Difference apparent per first account of 15 years 133,879 Total £222,548 as above.—The hon . gent . said , he had also caused a third account to be made out , chewing the state of Accounts between the same countries for 7 years , from 1798–9 to 1804–5 , inclusive ; which comprehended nearly the whole time of lord Wellesley 's government ; and this account stood thus : Total supplies to India and China £25,782 ; 632 Political charges paid in England 2,833,227 Both £ 28,615,859 Total imports £23,286,507 Payments received in England 4,762,767 28,079,274 Balance against India £536,585 To which may be added the balance that appears against India in 1805–6 , when the exports to it were very large , and the receipts from it unusually small 1,690,100 Total against India and China , in 8 years , up to 1st Sept. 1805 £2,226,685 There was still another way of reviewing this account : The balance as above , in a period of 15 years , from 1788—9 to 1802–3 , was in favour of India £133,879 In the two following years , 1803£4 and 1804£5 , the balance was against India 642,840 Apparent balance against India and China in 17 years £508,961 1156 Although these accounts , comprehending a great variety of transactions for a considerable length of time , were not to be contended for as absolutely perfect ; yet the hon . gent . said , they were , as far as he knew , just ; and he must conclude them to be , in fact , substantially so ; and , he did not question , far more accurate than those with which the hon . general had been furnished ; though he did not doubt they , also , had been made up without any intentional error . These statements , produced by the hon . general , made the balance against the commerce , from April 1793 , to April 1804 £5,794,622 To which add the balance by Mr. Grant 's statements in favour of it , as above 508,961 And the whole difference would be £6,303,583 It must , therefore , be highly presumable , that there were some great omissions , in the hon . general 's accounts , to the credit of England ; probably , the bills drawn on England . [ General Wellesley dissented from this observation ; and it appeared in the debate , on a following night , that the political charges paid in England , on account of the territory , were not credited in the general 's statements , and made the principal cause of difference . ] On the whole , therefore , there was
