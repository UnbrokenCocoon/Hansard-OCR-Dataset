the separate Charge as it stood on the 5th Jan. 1806. for interest of the Debt , & c. & c. was 2,922,346l . He begged leave to state , that he should not have found it necessary to propose to the Committee so large a sum by way of Loan if the taxes imposed last year had in their produce fulfilled the flattering expectations which had been held out ; but that certainly had not been the case , and he could in many respects account for the deficiency which had taken place . The charge on the Loan for the present year was 313,366l . including the discount and management . This was the whole of the Supply , and amounted in Irish Money to 8,975,194l . The Ways and Means by which he proposed to raise these supplies were as follows : there remained of the Loan last year in England 192,339l . which had not been drawn for , which of course was applicable to the service of the present year . There was a sum of 140,000l . advanced in the Autumn of 1805 , by the Treasury of Ireland , for Ordnance Services , and since repaid , One third of the three Lotte- 37 ries for the service of the year , 205,000l . Two seventeenths of the Prizes which His Majesty had been graciously pleased to grant to relieve the burthens of the People 127,450l . There was due from G. Britain to Ireland a sum of 50,000l . for seamen 's wages . The Loan for the service of Ireland , contracted for in England , amounted to two millions British , or in Irish money to 2,166,000l . The Loan negotiated in Ireland was two millions , and he proposed to raise the sum of 500,000l . by Treasury bills . The Revenues of Ireland for the present year , including the new duties which he should propose , he estimated at 3,800,000l . These various articles of Ways and Means amounted altogether to 9,181,455l . The Supply as he had before stated , was 8,975,194l . consequently there was a surplus of the Ways and Means above the supply of 206,261l . He had taken the Revenues for the year at 3,800,000l . and he would state shortly to the committee his reason for so doing : the produce of the Revenue up to the 5th of January was 3,354,000l . and he had reason to apprehend there remained about 160,000l . not collected ; and these two sums , added to the duties which he proposed to lay on for the present year amounted to rather more than 3,800,000l . In proposing the new Taxes to defray the interest of the Loan , he had endeavoured to press as lightly as possible upon the necessaries of life , or upon those articles which might press severely upon the lower order of the people . The first tax which he had to propose was an augmentation of the duty on Sugar , of 3s . 6d . per cwt . This duty was the same in every respect as that laid on G. Britain in the last and in the present session , but was to be consolidated the present Irish Duties . He estimated the amount at 60,000l . He also proposed that the duty upon East India Sugar should be carried rateably , as it was at present upon the brown sugars . The next tax he had to propose was one which he should have been glad to have avoided if possible ; but when it was considered how small a duty the article bore at present , and that there was an additional duty laid on it this session in G. Britain , he trusted the Committee would concur with him , that a small additional duty was unobjectionable . The article to which he alluded was Iron . The duty he meant to propose was 2s . per cwt . which was not above half a farthing a pound . It was to attach upon Russian and other Foreign Iron , slit , hammered
