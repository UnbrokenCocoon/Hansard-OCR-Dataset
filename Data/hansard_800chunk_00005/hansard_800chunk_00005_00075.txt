he could postpone his motion on that account , it would be a personal favour to him . said , he would certainly rather postpone his motion for another day , than that it should throw any impediment in the way of a measure which he conceived of such great importance as that bill ; but in consenting to withdraw his motion for to-morrow , he relied on its being suffered to come on without interruption on Wednesday next . in the absence of his noble friend ( lord Howick ) , who would have to take a material part in the debate on the subject , requested the hon . gent . would state the nature of the charges he meant to bring forward against the noble earl , to whom his motion was to apply . replied , that he was resolved to pursue the course adopted by the hon . prosecutor ( Mr. Whitbread ) in the impeachment now pending in Westminster Hall , who gave in his charges only on the morning of the day on which the house was to proceed on them.â€”On being again applied to , Mr. Jeffery stated , that his charges against earl St. Vincent would be for misconduct , neglect , and mismanagement , Whilst he was first lord of the admiralty . moved the commitment of the Property Duty Bill . did not mean to object to the 110 Speaker 's leaving the chair , but he thought it incumbent upon him to state his opinion of the principle of the bill .
