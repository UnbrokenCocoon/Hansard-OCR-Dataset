known to the hon . general opposite ( sir Arthur Wellesley ) who himself so ably conducted the war in the Deckan , and to whose military prowess is most 1208 essentially to he attributed its successful issue , and its not having been carried into our own districts . Doubtless there are expences incident to a state of war , although the troops may not be actually in the field ; and the war in Europe by giving birth to the maritime expeditions I have alluded to , contributed essentially to the reduction of the surplus revenue ; but it made no other very considerable addition to our Indian expenditure , for , owing to the vigilance of government , and the vast superiority of our navy , not a French soldier landed in India . If then I were to he asked , to what causes the present state of our finances in India were to be attributed , I should answer , that they might be traced to a system of policy which sought the aggrandisement and extention of the British empire and influence in India , through the medium of what is called the system of subsidiary alliances , or the bringing all the native states into subjection to , or dependence on the British power , by means of large bodies of troops stationed in their respective capitals , with agents or ministers , on the part of the Company , to watch and direct their political conduct . This system became the fruitful parent of an extended war , on an extended scale of expence , and a corresponding system of finance and general expenditure ; in both of which economy was overlooked , or perhaps did not seem necessary ; for one of the effects of this system was a vast nominal increase of revenue by the necessity of exacting from each native prince a subsidy for defraying the expence of the troops stationed in his capital . These subsidies , whether in money , or commuted for an equivalent in territory , occasioned a great apparent increase of revenue , and every extention of our territory or revenue being supposed to bring with it a proportionate extention of our means of paying , produced a real alteration in the scale of ideas and expectations , and unfortunately the increased expenditure by new establishments , and new or augmented salaries and allowances , not being made conditional , or dependent on the continuance of a surplus revenue , remained after the surplus had ceased to exist . Such I believe to have been , in abstract , the combined causes of the present embarrassed state of our finances in India ; hut , do I therefore concur in the position which the hon . alderman has so industriously laboured to impress upon the committee , namely , that the East India Company is insolvent ? No , sir , I deny that the Company is insolvent , or that our present pecu- 1209 niary difficulties will make us so , unless we continue in the course which has brought them upon us . How then are our finances to be retrieved , and what is to be done ? Why , sir , if there is a determined disposition to retrieve them on both sides the Atlantic , they may and will be retrieved by measuring back our steps to those systems , both political and financial , from which we ought never to have departed ; in a word , the system and principles of Cornwallis ; by disavowing all views of extending our dominion and influence in India , and in proof of the sincerity of the disavowal , relinquishing the acquisitions both in territory and alliances , which have been made under them ; and lastly , by contracting the number of our vast and expensive establishments , and the scale of those which it may be necessary to continue . The work , both in respect to policy and finance , we have reason to believe is already begun , and if persevered in with firmness and decision ,
