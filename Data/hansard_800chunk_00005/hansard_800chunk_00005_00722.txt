statement will serve to shew , that in case of the transfer of the territory , upon the conclusion of the charter , there is value in India to the amount of the debt . But it may be contended , that this statement is no justification of the amount of the debt , which , from 1793 , when it was 7,362,190l. , has increased to be , in April 1806 , 27,722,391l . ; of which sum , 16,669,745l . have been incurred since 1798 , under the administration of the late gov.-gen. marquis Wellesley . In order to understand the mode in which this debt has been incurred , it is necessary to advert to the state of the company 's affairs , in the year 1798 . The revenues at that time were £8,059,580 The charges , including supplies to Bencoolen , & c. 765,654 The interest of the Debt was 603,926 Leaving a deficiency of resource or a surplus net charge , of 194,700 The Debt in 1798 was 11,032,645 The assets in India were 9,922,903 This state of the resources in India had been occasioned by a laudable desire to increase the investment as much as was possible , which will be seen by a review of what had passed between the years 1793 and 1798 . In April 1793 , the revenues of India were £8,294,399 The charges , including Bencoolen , & c. were 6,155,968 The interest of the Debt was 526,205 The Debt was 7,362,190 The assets were 8,834,538 The surplus revenue , after providing for all charges , exclusive of receipts for sales , & c. was 1,612,226 In the course of the five years between 1793 and 1798 , the following events occurred to increase the charges in India : there was war in Europe ; an expedition 1074 was fitted out against Mauritius ; and another against Manilla ; Pondicherry and Cochin were taken ; and maritime expeditions were sent against Ceylon , Malacca , and the eastern islands . It was necessary to keep up large establishments in the conquests made ; and salaries were paid to the civil and military servants of our enemies who became our prisoners . During the same period of time , the company 's military establishments in India were new-modelled , and this occasioned an increase of expense . The civil and judicial establishments in Bengal were fixed on the just scale on which they exist at this day ; which at that time occasioned an increase of annual expense to a very considerable amount . Accordingly it appears , that the actual charges of the civil and military establishments in 1798 , exceeded the actual charges of the civil and military establishment in the year 1793 , in the amount of 1,372,209l. , and the supplies to Bencoolen , & c. of 1798 , exceeded those of 1793 in the amount of 102,477l . But the efficient cause of the state in which the finances were found , in the year 1798 , was the continuance to send borne investment at the high rate at which it had been fixed in the year 1793 , notwithstanding that the charges of India had necessarily increased , and the revenues had decreased to the amount of 234,519l . By reference to the accounts , it will be found , that in the five years between 1793 and 1798 , the cost and charges of investments sent home to Europe , was £9,898,794 Supplies to China 339,444 Amount advanced in India to the king 's and company 's ships during the same period , was 551,952 Making a total disbursed on account of London , of 10,784,190 The amount of supplies received from Europe , in the same period , for bills drawn , stores , merchandise , export sales , and bullion , was 3,744,425 Leaving a balance of 7,039,765 against London . It appears , by what is above stated , that the charges in India , between 1793 and 1798 , had increased considerably ; but there was , upon the 5 years , a surplus of receipt of revenue
