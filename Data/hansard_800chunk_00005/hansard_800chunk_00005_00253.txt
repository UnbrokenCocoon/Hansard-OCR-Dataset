having represented to his excellency the nabob vizier , the late very great increase of the company 's establishments , by the addition of several regiments of cavalry , both European and native ; and having , in compliance with the company 's order , solicited his excellency 's assistance to defray the consequent additional expence ; '' it was stipulated , in an agreement made at Lucknow in the month of March , in the year last-mentioned , between the said governor-general and the nabob vizier , that `` his excellency the nabob vizier , in the fullest reliance that the company 's troops are ever ready , in conformity to existing circumstances , to protect and defend his dominions against the attacks of all his enemies , will annually defray the actual bonâfide expences of a regiment of Europeans and one of native cavalry ; ( that is to say ) two regiments , ( the amount of which expences , the governor-general can not at present specify , ) provided they shall not exceed , upon every account , five lacks and a half of rupees per annum ; the amount to be defrayed by monthly instalments , of which the first shall commence with the month of Bysade of the present Fussiley year . `` —That , in the year 1797 , the nabob vizier Asoph ul Dowlah died , and was , for a short space , succeeded in the musnud ( or throne ) by a pretended son , named Vizier Ally Cawn , who , through the aid of the elder Begum and of the great Aumil Almas Ali Cawn , usurped the throne , to the prejudice of the rightful heir Saadut Ali Cawn , brother of the late nabob vizier Asoph ul Dowlah . That , by the aid of the English East-India company , the usurper was dethroned , and Saadut Ali Cawn was placed on the throne on the 21st of January 1798 . That , on the 21st of February in the year last mentioned , a new treaty was made at Lucknow between the said nabob vizier Saadut Ali Cawn , on the one part , and the said East- 375 India company on the other part , the said sir John Shore being still the governor-general , as aforesaid . That , in the treaty here mentioned , it was stipulated , that , as the English company had `` incurred a considerable expence by their exertions to restore the nabob vizier to the possession of his rights , he the said nabob vizier should , in consideration thereof , pay to the company the sum of 12 lacs of rupees ; '' and further , it was in the said treaty stipulated , that , `` with a view to enable the English company to fulfil their engagements to defend the dominions of the nabob vizier , and at the same time to provide for the protection of their own dominions , the company having largely increased their military establishments by new levied regiments for that purpose ; '' that the annual subsidy paid to the company by the nabob vizier should be augmented from .55½ to 76 lacs of rupees ( or 950,000l . ) , including the stipends to the Begums and others , and which subsidy the nabob vizier was to pay by monthly kists ( or instalments ) , each instalment being in amount equal to a 12th part of the whole annual subsidy . And further , it was in the said treaty stipulated , as to the company 's troops to be maintained in the principality of Oude for its defence , that the said troops should `` never consist of less than ten thousand men , including Europeans and natives , cavalry , infantry , and artillery ; and that if , at any time , it should become necessary to augment the troops of the company in Oude beyond the number of 13,000 men , including Europeans and natives , infantry , cavalry , and artillery , the nabob Saadut Ali Cawn should pay the actual difference
