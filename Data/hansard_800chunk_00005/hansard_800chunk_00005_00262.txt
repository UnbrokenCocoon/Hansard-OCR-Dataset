sufficient to enable the said nabob vizier to meet all the demands that would ever come against him for the support of the company 's troops to be in lieu thereof introduced into the dominions of Oude ; having introduced into the said dominions , corps upon corps , adding expence to expence , making , upon exaggerated and fraudulent estimates and returns , demand after demand on the treasury of the nabob vizier , while at the same time he undermined the authority of the said nabob vizier over the persons from whom his revenues were 388 immediately received ; having , in fact , seized upon great part of the territories from winch the nabob vizier 's revenues were derived , insomuch , that on the 18th of July 1801 , in answer to reproaches to him by the said William Scott made , relative to the non-payment of the kist , the said nabob vizier in the bitterness of his heart , thus represented the tyranny over him by the said marquis Wellesley exercised : `` In respect to the kist , you well know , that in opposition to and in defiance of me , you have called before you the aumils and their vakeels ( or messengers ) , and , without my acquiescence , or any participation on my part , you have told them that such and such countries belonged to the company , and have forbidden them giving me the peishgee , advance ; and further , you have directed the officers in command of the troops to establish themselves in the countries alluded to ; judge then , what confusion these circumstances must have given rise to in the country ; what confidence the aumils can now repose in me : having first deprived use of the means of collecting the revenues , you then call upon me to make payments . `` â€”Having , by means so unjust , and tyrannical , reduced the said nabob vizier to the situation here described , the said marquis Wellesley , under the false pretence of being so authorized to act by the treaty of 1798 , did demand , and by and through the means of his brother the hon .

That , in the month of November 1801 , a treaty , in which the said cession was stipulated for , was concluded with the nabob vizier ; that the said Henry Wellesley , in order to compel the said nabob vizier thereunto to consent , did renew the alarming threats so frequently resorted to by the said marquis Wellesley , by the means of , and in concert with the said William Scott ; that he the said Henry Wellesley was instructed to declare , and to the said nabob vizier did declare , the settled determination of his brother , the said marquis Wellesley , to seize upon the whole of the dominions of Oude , unless the cession proposed was assented to ; and that the said marquis Wellesley , resorting again to his false , malicious , and wicked construction of the paper of re- 389 quests , did instruct the said Henry Wellesley to present and to publish a declaration , containing the parts of the said paper referred to , together with the said marquis Wellesley 's construction thereof , to the end that the most opulent and powerful subjects of the said nabob vizier might thereby be induced to abandon their sovereign , and to join in the views of the said marquis Wellesley ; which said instructions were expressed in the following words ; to wit : `` You will communicate to the Begum , to the other members of his excellency 's family , and to the principal persons of rank at the vizier 's court , the nature and extent of those acts of arbitrary power
