strong remonstrances to the council against it , urging that the consequences of it must be ruinous to the islands . These complaints were immediately attended to , and the parties were fully and patiently heard before the committee for trade : they were permitted to produce evidence as long as they had any to offer , and all other persons were called upon who were thought likely to throw any light on the subject , including merchants resident in Great Britain , late governors in America , and British settlers in that country . This enquiry , conducted with the utmost impartiality , lasted two or three months ; and ended in a report recommend- 688 ing that the proclamation confining the trade to British ships should be enforced . It could indeed have no other termination , as it was satisfactorily proved to the lords that the supplies to the islands might be regularly furnished in these ships at moderate prices ; and that the sale of rum would not thereby be prejudiced . The trade was accordingly so carried on from that year ( 1784 ) to 1793 , without the slightest inconvenience having been experienced in either of those respects by the islands ; they were plentifully supplied with lumber and provisions at moderate prices , and they found a ready and fair market for their rum and melasses . The good effects of this adherence to the navigation laws , were as striking as they are incontrovertible , as will he seen by time rapid increase of colonial shipping , contrary to the assertion of the West India planters before the committee for trade in 1785 , who then stated that any shipping being fitted from the islands was hopeless.—In 1790 belonging to the West India islands , 706 ships , 86,010 tons , 5,115 men . In 1804 , reduced to 67 ships , 7,629 tons , 626 men . To continental colonies , in 1790 , 229 ships , 24,900 tons , 1,452 men . In 1804 , 100 ships , 11,906 tons , 734 men . In 1792 , British ships in the American trade inwards , 197 ships , 42,035 tons , 22,400 men . In 1794 ditto 11 ships , 2,152 tons , 134 men . It must , however , be admitted that the whole of the falling off of the ships from Great Britain was not owing to the suspension of the navigation act , as there were other causes that contributed to that.—I have already admitted that the governors of the islands began so early as the year 1793 , or 1791 , to relax from a due observance of the navigation laws , and I believe it was , in most instances at least , necessary they should do so : because , on the breaking out of the war time trade in British ships was much interrupted , and measures were not taken for furnishing regular convoys ; the suspensions were , however , only partially restrained to particular articles , as well as limited in time—and on the appointment of a noble duke and myself to time presidency and vice-presidency of the board of trade , in 1804 , we made enquiries , the result of which inclined us to think , that even during war , the terms of the proclamation alluded to might be acted upon , if convoys could be furnished . Instructions were indeed sent out to the governors in the West Indies in 1804 , and 1805 , in consequence of the 689 communications from the committee of trade , that occasioned the relaxation laws to be very much narrowed , and fortified by which the governors were preparing the islands for an adherence to them , except in cases of real and urgent necessity . The governor of Barbadoes , in particular strongly expressed the support he derived from his instructions , and his hope that he should succeed to the extent desired , making great complaints of the unnecessary interference of foreigners with our colonial navigation , and of the illicit practises of the Americans in particular
