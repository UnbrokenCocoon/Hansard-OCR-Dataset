seizure of their towns ; a measure unjust and unwise in itself , and dangerous to the tranquil 1028 lity of the country ; a measure which , even in the proudest days of mussulman despotism , had never been attempted.—That , for a series of years , it had been the custom of the country for the said rajahs , in the quality of Zemindars , to rent of the nabob vizier himself , or of his great Aumils , the lands surrounding their hereditary estates , which were again let by them to the Ryots , or husbandmen , by whom they were cultivated ; the rent required of the cultivator being always , according to the liberality of avarice of the zemindar , proportionate to that at which the lands were held of the aumil , or of the nabob viziers.—That , in furtherance of his determination respecting the said rajahs , the said marquis Wellesley , ( he having also determined , contrary to every principle of equity and humanity which should have actuated a British governor , to impose new and heavy burthens upon the already overburthened people of the said extorted countries , ) did , by the means of his brother , the hon . Henry Wellesley , whom he had illegally appointed lieutenant-governor of the said countries , and other unlawful agents , require of the said rajahs and zemindars an enormous increase of the rents which they had theretofore paid ; an exaction calculated to produce great discontent among the said rajahs and zemindars , and , by the oppression which it would infallibly drive them to exercise towards the husbandmen , to reduce those useful and unfortunate men to the extreme of poverty , wretchedness , and want.—That , taking advantage of the reluctance which the said rajahs and zemindars naturally felt to accede to the said oppressive and tyrannical requisitions , and making their reluctance a pretext for the execution of his long-meditated views respecting the said rajahs and zemindars , the said marquis Wellesley did declare all those who did not submit to the said requisitions , to be in a state of disaffection or rebellion to the government ; a government which was notoriously an usurpation , and to which the said rajahs and zemindars had never acknowledged any allegiance , and to which they owed no obedience.—That , true to the character of an usurper and a despot , disdaining to conciliate acquiescence where he had the power to compel submission , the said marquis Wellesley did , to the disgrace of the British arms , call in British troops to enforce his said unlawful , unjust , severe , and arbitrary demands upon the said rajahs and zemindars.—That the greater part of the said rajahs and zemindars , some intimidated by threats , and others overawed by the presence of the military ; some 1029 yielding to numerous bodies of troops which surrounded their fields , and prepared to assail their mansions , and others actually attacked , conquered , and subdued ; some conscious of the hopelessness of resistance ; and some terrified by the awful example of others ; were finally compelled to submit , in the most humiliating and abject manner , to all the said unlawful , unjust , severe , and arbitrary demands of the said marquis Wellesley.—That those of the said rajahs and zemindars Who had the hardihood to resist the oppression of the said marquis Wellesley , were treated as rebels and enemies , expelled from their homes and driven from their country , their towns being plundered or burnt , their fortresses demolished or held by their enemies , and their estates confiscated for the use of their conquerors.—That thus , in violation of all law and justice and humanity , and to the disgrace of the British name in India , were the said rajahs and zemindars , the descendants of the most ancient , the most princely , and the most venerable families in Hindustan , degraded , oppressed , ruined , or destroyed by the said marquis Wellesley and his illegal agents.—That , among
