'' 5 . `` That the amount of all such balances , stated in the said account , 1124 be carried to the credit , and taken in diminution , of ways and means which may be granted for the service of the year in which such account may be laid.â€”On moving , That it would be a considerable saving to the public , that the annual duty upon malt and sugar should be rendered permanent , and carried to the annual produce of the consolidated fund , if not otherwise appropriated , rose to oppose the proposition , which he considered as a striking innovation , introduced at the close of a session of parliament , without any formality or mature consideration that should have accompanied proposal , which , if he understood the hon . gent . must go to trench very materially upon a constitutional privilege of the house of commons , and materially abridge that wholesome check which it held upon the crown , namely , the privilege of voting or withholding the supplies annually . We had been , he said , heretofore frightened at the apprehensions of a standing army ; but now we had got that standing army . That it might be rendered necessary by the circumstances of the times , he would not now dispute . But here was a proposal in which the house was called upon , at a moments warning , to vote those taxes in perpetuity , which hitherto had been voted only annually .

Amongst these was that of voting the taxes annually . He did not apprehend any approaching difference between the crown and the parliament ; but as such differences had arisen before , they might possibly arise again ; for which reason that house should not part with such checks as remained in its hands at present . said , it would give the crown no power whatever over the public purse , as the supplies must be voted from year to year . observed , that all the resolutions were in his opinion unexceptionable , but the present . He wished the house to retain its power over the means by which the money was to flow into the exchequer , as well as over the subsequent appropriation of it . To simplify the making up of the public accounts was undoubtedly a desirable object , but it was a very inferior one when compared with
