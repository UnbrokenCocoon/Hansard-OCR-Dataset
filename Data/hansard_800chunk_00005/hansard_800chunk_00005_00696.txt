villagers , fell upon a party of the said rajah 's troops , and slew great numbers of them ; and thus began the lawless and barbarous slaughter of the said rajah 's brave and faithful adherents.—That the warfare was thus carried on until Jan. 15 , when 1031 an unsuccessful attempt was made to carry the fort by assault ; and this failure having been attended with some loss , and having brought great discredit on the British arms , the commander-in-chief , on 31st Jan. , appeared in person before Sasnee , at the head of a powerful reinforcement.—That more vigorous preparations were accordingly made , the most effectual means taken to prevent the escape of the said rajah , and the admission of succours ; and , on 8th Feb. , another attack was made upon the town , and another dreadful slaughter of the said rajah 's brave and faithful followers ensued.—That , on the night of Feb. 12 , the said rajah , discouraged by the loss of so many of his troops , alarmed by the magnitude and extent of the preparations which were making for his destruction , unable to oppose any further effectual resistance without exposing himself and his people to the risk of being wholly destroyed , and justly averse to falling into the hands of his avaricious , tyrannical , rapacious , and blood-thirsty enemies , taking advantage of the uncommon darkness of the night , and followed by many of his adherents , fled from the fort of Sasnee , and , thus banished from the country of his forefathers , took refuge in the country of the Mahrattas.—That others of his adherents , haying attempted to take shelter in his fort of Bidjegliur , were , to a man , most barbarously cut to pieces by the British troops who surrounded it.—That , on 13th Feb. , the said commander-in-chief , not satisfied with the devastation and carnage which had already been made , posted the army under his command before Bidjeghur , stationed them in such a manner as to prevent the garrison from escaping and from receiving any succours , and , after having Summoned the Killedar , rajah Ham Chobbie , to deliver up the fort , upon the promise of sparing the lives of the garrison , and , after having refused to grant the said Killedar a few days to obtain the consent of his master , the said rajah Bugwunt Sing made preparations for storming the fort.—That , on the night of Feb. 27 , the said Killedar , incapable of holding out against the attacks of the assailants , and unwilling to give up those who had been entrusted to his care to the merciless enemies of his chief , availing himself of the uncommon darkness of the night , and of a heavy rain , led the garrison out of the fort , and , after being attacked and having many of his followers killed , and great numbers taken prisoners , with much difficulty succeeded in making his escape with the rest.—That , the expulsion of the said rajah Bugwunt Sing and his adherents being 1032 accomplished , his forts were taken possession of by those who had accomplished it , and all his estates and property of every kind were confiscated for the use of the aforesaid usurped government.—That thus was the said rajah Bugwunt Sing , zemindar of Sasnee and Bidjeghur , a Hindu prince of great worth and courage , the descendant of one of the oldest and mast respected families in Hindustan , solely from an unwillingness to consent to the oppressive and unjust demands of those who had extorted the territories , and usurped the government of his sovereign , treated as a rebel and an outlaw , attacked in his own mansions by a powerful military force , driven in exile , as a criminal and fugitive , from the countries where his forefathers had from time immemorial lived in greatness and splendour ; his brave and faithful ad lie rents driven from their families and their homes , dispersed among strangers and
