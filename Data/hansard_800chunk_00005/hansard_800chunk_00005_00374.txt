such an army no free state had long maintained its freedom ; and it was contended , not that , our military exertions ought therefore to be less , but that our military force ought to continue to preserve that character of variety which is so odious in the eyes of the right hon . gent . but which it can not lose without a departure from the practice and the principles of the constitution . In this general objection to the right hon . gent 's . whole theory of military improvement ( which t am not sorry to have an opportunity of re-stating and re-affirming ) , what is there inconsistent with the objection stated to this particular measure , that it takes the management of the king 's army out of the hands of the king ; because we feel a jealousy and apprehension of the project of having nothing but a regular army in the country ; does it therefore follow , that we are not to disapprove of innovations , as dangerous as unnecessary in the constitution of that army ? I , would leave the kings authority over the regular army entire as I find it ; but I. would not 550 trust the whole defence of the country , internal as well as external , to that army alone . Is there any thing contradictory in this , statement ? Leave us our constitutional , force , and there is no danger from the regular army . But it is a poor device first to break down every other force upon which the country has relied , and to which the constitution is partial , and then to think we can remedy the inconvenience by taking the government of the regular army into Our own hands.â€”Equally unfounded is that part of the noble lord 's statement in which he imputes as an inconsistency and absurdity to those who have agreed with him , with his right hon . friend , and with all mankind , in the necessity of keeping up , under the present circumstances of the world , large military establishments , that they now complain of the vast drain and demand upon the population of the country ; and that after concurring in the wish that the country should be militarized as much as possible , they now oppose the means best calculated to produce that effect . The whole of this statement proceeds upon a mistake of one argument , and an assumption of another . I never heard it stated , I am sure I never stated it , as a matter of complaint , or even of regret , that there was so large a drain and demand for military service upon the population of the country . I have stated it , and I have heard it stated , as matter Of fact ; and as affording a sufficient answer to those who , because the regular army could not be augmented on the sudden to the proportion which they represent as necessary , have thought themselves therefore entitled to despond as to the military means , or to discourage the military spirit of the country . And as to opposing the measures by which those military means were to be concerted , and that military spirit to be encouraged and extended , the justice of that imputation depends upon the assumption of the fact , that the measures devised by the right hon . gent . are in truth the best calculated for that purpose , and upon the further assumption of our acknowledgment that they are so . We acknowledge no such thing : we oppose the right hon . gentleman 's plans , because we think them not the best calculated for this purpose ; because we differ from him , as to his opinion that all the other military establishments of the country would be wisely and cheaply sacrificed to procure a comparatively small numerical increase of the regular army ; because we think directly the contrary ; because , desirable as the augmentation , to any 551 amount you please ,
