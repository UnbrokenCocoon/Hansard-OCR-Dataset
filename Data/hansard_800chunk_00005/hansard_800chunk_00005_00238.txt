, so that it was unnecessary for him to take up any portion of their time by describing it . Whether they looked to the clear , able , and argumentative manner , in which the case had been stated , to the acute , judicious , and discriminating sagacity displayed in the examination of evidence ; to the perspicuous , cogent , and comprehensive manner in which the evidence had been summed up ; or to the splendid and luminous efforts of eloquence , by which that evidence had been enforced , the house would be at a loss to decide which of the exertions was most entitled to its approbation and thanks . There was another point of view , however , in which these gentlemen appeared to him to merit the thanks of the house , and of every person attached to that most constitutional process , for bringing great and powerful delinquents to justice . It could not but be owned , that , of late years , considerable delays , difficulties , and embarrassments , had brought this mode of trial into disrepute , and created an indisposition in many well-intentioned and respectable persons to have recourse to it at all . But by the manner in which the managers had conducted the late trial , by the care they had used to avoid going into any extraneous topics , and to confine themselves to such points only as were essentially interwoven with the merits of the case , they had in some degree done away those objections to a species of trial , that afforded the best security for the rights and liberties of the people , and was the most salutary and constitutional instrument of the power of parliament . That house had now discharged its duty ; it had performed what it owed to the public , and no responsibility attached to it . The only duty that it had now to perform , was to do justice to the merits of those who had so well acquitted themselves of the important trust delegated to them . He should therefore conclude with moving , `` That the thanks of this house be given to the members who were appointed the Managers of the Impeachment of Henry lord viscount Melville , for their faithful management in their discharge of the trust reposed in them . `` —The motion was seconded by sir John Newport , and agreed to with only one dissentient voice . then calling on the Managers , who stood up in their several places , addressed them , in a most impressive manner , as follows : `` Gentlemen , this house , upon the result of grave and important enquiries into the administration of the Public Expenditure , came to the resolution of entering upon the most solemn of all its functions ; and of resorting to that transcendent power , by which it can bring to judgment all misdeeds done by the highest servants of the crown , and most effectually avenge all inroads made , or attempted to be made , upon the liberties of the people . The conduct and management of that power is delegated to you ; to prepare and arrange the proofs of complex and intricate facts ; and to make good the charge of high crimes and misdemeanours against a noble person , whose elevated and splendid situations in the state rendered his actions of signal example , for good or for evil , to all persons entrusted with the public treasure . Throughout the progress of the Trial so undertaken , we have seen with peculiar satisfaction , its proceedings conducted with an exemplary diligence and dispatch , which have rescued Impeachments from the disgrace into which they had nearly fallen , and have restored them to their antient strength and honour . Upon your part , we have also witnessed , that unwearied industry , and singular sagacity , with which you have pursued and established the proofs ; —that boldness , so properly belonging to the Commons , with which you have maintained the Charge ; and that powerful
