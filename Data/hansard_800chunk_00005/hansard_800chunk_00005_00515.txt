and their witnesses have been all paid the expences incurred by them in prosecuting their complaints , out of the public money.—Your petitioner feels himself bound to state to your lordships , that several of the remaining charges would probably , from the nature of the allegations contained therein , occupy more of your lordships ' time than that which has been thus heard in part.—Your petitioner , under these circumstances , feels himself called upon to state most respectfully to your lordships , the many grievous hardships which result to him from proceedings which are novel in their nature , and harassing by their delay—which subject his character to continued public obloquy , which he has had no opportunity to remove or repel , and which are almost ruinous to hi private fortune ; the pressure of which is the more severely felt by him , inasmuch as the expences of his accusers have been defrayed out the public treasury.—Your petitioner , penetrated by a lively sense of the many difficulties , and hardships , to which he has been subjected , without an imputation on the uprightness or integrity of his conduct , wounded in his personal and judicial feelings , and still more deeply affected by he embarrassment , so long suspended over the administration of justice , at this advanced period of the third session , in which his name has been coupled with parliamentary accusation—Humbly prays your lordships to consider the nature and circumstances of his case , and to make such orders therein as to your lordship 's wisdom and justice shall seem meet .

That period has 756 arrived , and your lordships are now called upon to decide , whether , after the laborious investigation in which you have so recently been engaged , you think it expedient or advantageous that you should enter into a new one , which , from the nature of the charges , and the experience you have had , you must be convinced , can not fail of proving equally extensive . On this subject I have no hesitation in stating what is my decided opinion . Resting it merely on the advanced period of the session , and the nature of the case , I think we are called upon to come at once to a final determination . But , my lords , I have much and more important objections to the proceeding . It has often been felt by me as an indispensable duty in the course of this proceeding , to state the clear conviction I entertain , strengthened as it has been by every opportunity I have had of examining it , that this proceeding is ab initio wrong—that it is carrying on before a court not competent to enquire into it , and that it is in a course in which it can not be brought to the issue proposed . My lords , this conviction rests on plain and broad considerations , which , the more they are examined , the more they will be found to be the undeniable law of parliament , and from which results this position , `` That no criminal complaint can be preferred and proceeded upon in this house .
