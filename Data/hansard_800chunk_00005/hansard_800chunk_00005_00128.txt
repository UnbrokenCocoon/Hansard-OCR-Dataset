That between the 18th Feb. 1801 , and the 15th May 1804 , there were launched 7 sail of the line , and 8 frigates from the merchants ' yards ; and 3 sail of the line , and 4 frigates from the king 's yards ; and that there were captured in the same period , 4 sail of the line and 10 frigates ; and that none were purchased : so that the total addition to the navy in this period of 3 years and 3 months , was only 14 sail of the line and 32 frigates ; making an average of not more than 4⅓sail of the line , and 7 frigates per annum . — 9 . That of the 3 line-of-battle ships launched in the king 's yards within the said period of 3 years and 3 months , one of them was launched in June , and one in Oct. 1801 ; and that only one line-of-battle ship was launched from the king 's yards , between the 22d Oct. 1801 , and 15th May 187 1804.—10 . That in these 3 years and 3 months , viz . from the 18th Feb. 1801 , to the 15th May 1804 , there were taken from the navy by various casualties , 11 sail of the line and 30 frigates ; leaving the increase of ships of the line , only 3 ; and an actual decrease of frigates ; whereas in the 8 years preceding , there had been ( after deducting the ships taken away from the navy ) an actual increase of 45 sail of the line , and 68 frigates . — 11 . That when the earl of St. Vincent quitted the admiralty on the 15th May 1804 , he left building only 9 line of battle ships ; 5 of which were actually building , before the commencement of his administration . — 12 . That the earl of St. Vincent officially declared on the 29th Dec. 1802 , that there was an urgent necessity for entering into contracts for building as many 74-gun ships as would be undertaken by fit persons in every part of the kingdom ; and that offers were made for building ships of that rate , at the average price of 26l . per ton.— 13 . That on the 13th Jan. 1803 , these offers , to build 74-gun ships at 26l . per ton , were rejected , by direction of the board of admiralty ; that board declaring at the same time its determination , that no line-of-battle ship should be then built in merchants ' yards.—14 . That notwithstanding the official declaration made on the 29th Dec. 1802 , by the first lord of the admiralty , of the urgent necessity of entering into contracts for building as many 74-gun ships , as could be undertaken by fit persons in every part of the kingdom , not a single ship was ordered to be contracted for , in the merchants ' yards ; or to be laid down in the king 's yards , in the subsequent 18 months during which his lordship remained in office.—15 . That in the month of Jan. 1805 , contracts were entered into for building in the merchants ' yards ten 74-gun ships , at the rate of 36l . per ton ; being an advance of 10l . per ton , on the rate , at which they might have been built , under the tenders made in Jan. 1803.—16 .
