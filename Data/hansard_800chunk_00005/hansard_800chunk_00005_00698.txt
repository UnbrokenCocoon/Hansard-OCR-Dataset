a short time had elapsed , when 4 or 5 troopers galloped after 2 or 3 of my people , whom they wounded with their swords ; and thus began hostilities . My people seeing no alternative , fired 2 or 3 matchlocks . My evil destiny has created this misunderstanding . I never meant to wage war , nor do I now . You are master and ruler of the country ; if , out of your great bounty , you will cast a favour 1034 able eye on me , and allow me to reside in this place , it will be an act of mercy and great kindness . I am ready to pay the stipulated revenue , to be perfectly obedient , and never to shelter myself behind any excuse ; and whatever you shall order respecting me , shall be fulfilled . `` —That to this letter , explaining so minutely and so faithfull the cause of the misunderstanding that had taken place , and testifying so fully the great regret which that circumstance had produced expressing , in such mild and submissive terms , the willingness of the said rajah to do whatever might be required of him by those whose displeasure he so sincerely deprecated , and whose favour he so earnestly courted , and , from its unaffected and ingenuous simplicity , so well calculated to excite , not merely the clemency , but the compassion , and the good-will of the humane the generous , and the just , the said commander-in-chief , on the same day , returned the following harsh , severe , and haughty answer : `` After having so wantonly broken your faith in refusing to evacuate and deliver up the fort of Cutchoura , agreeably to the terms of your agreement with Mr. Russell , and treated the troops who went with you to receive possession of the place with harshness and contempt , turning them out of the fort , and thereby proclaiming war ; the only terms which can now be granted are , that you shall deliver up the fort , the garrison , your children , and yourself , to the commander-in-chief , to be disposed of as he shall judge proper .
