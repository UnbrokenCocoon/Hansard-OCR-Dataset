; and that he continued to fill and to exercise the powers of the said office and offices , until the month of August 1805 , when he was there in superseded by Charles marquis Cornwallis.â€”That Oude is an independent principality in the peninsula of India , adjoining on the one side to the British territories , being in extent somewhat larger than England and Wales , having many large and populous cities ; amongst which is Lucknow , the present capital , exceeding , in number 367 of inhabitants London and Westminster together ; a and containing in the whole principality , a population of nearly 6,000,000 souls . That the government is monarchical in form and absolute in the person of the sovereign , whose title is that of Nabob Vizier ; who had under him , previous to the spoliation and extortion of marquis Wellesley , a high and opulent nobility ; whose court exhibited every mark of splendour , and every proof of reverence and devotion to the sovereign ; whose jewels alone were worth 4,000,000l . sterling ; whose retinue was so numerous , that he was sometimes attended with 500 elephants richly caparisoned , the whole number of his elephants and stable horses amounting to several thousands ; and whose army consisted of more than 13,000 horse , and 30,000 foot , exclusive of artillery , and exclusive also of an armed police . That the principality of Oude abounds in fertile lands , and yields ( besides those sorts of grain which are common to England ) cotton , indigo , rice , sugar , and many other valuable commodities . That the manufactories , previous to the spoliations of marquis Wellesley , were extensive , and the exports thereof great , both in quantity of goods And in amount of value ; and that the revenues of the country were abundant , and daily increasing . That the mode of raising the revenues of Oude has grown out of the nature of the government ; according to the laws and usages of which , the sovereign , that is to say , the nabob vizier , is the sole and exclusive owner of the lands , there being in the country no property but that which is derived from the profits of the taxes farmed out or let by him , and collected by his authority , and , if need be , by the aid of his troops . That the great renters or farmers-general of the taxes , are called Aumils , of whom there are about 20 in number , and to whom the taxes of counties or portions of the country are let ; the two principal aumils being Almas Ali Cawn and Mirza Mehindy , the former having the farm of one-third and the latter of one-fourth of the revenues of the whole country . That there is another class of renters or farmers of the taxes under the aumils , called Zemindars , a superior class of whom are also distinguished by the name of Rajabs , who rent of the aumils the taxes of their several townships or villages , each zemindar being , however , in such his minor district , a sort of hereditary feudal chieftain , having his family , his clan , and 368 generally a fortress to defend himself against the aumil , in case of a quarrel arising from the oppression of the latter , or from any other cause . That from the Ryots , or husbandmen , and manufacturers ( which character is generally united in the same person ) the takes are collected by their respective zemindars . That the rent of the taxes is fixed by agreements annually made , first , between the nabob vizier and the aumils , who are , besides , great nobles , composing a part of his court , and , except in the season of collecting , residing in the capital ; next , between the aumils and the zemindars , from whom the former obtain as high a rent as they can prevail on the latter to
