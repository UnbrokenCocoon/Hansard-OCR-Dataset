to distinguish what they had always been studiously endeavouring to confound ; and to separate the trading capital from the resources of dominion , and , as far as the documents before the house would allow him , the capital required by the India trade , from that of China.—The hon . Alderman then proceeded to read an extract from the Budgets of 1804 and 1805 , reciting , as he proceeded , the points of reference in each . The advances for trade in the three Presidencies , and Fort Marlborough in 1802–3 were , he observed , upwards of two millions . While these cargoes were coming home , others were collecting at the Presidencies which employed 2,300,000l . more . The Cash Balances abroad on the 30th of April , 1804 , were nearly £600,000 So that taking these Sums , as they stood , of 2,100,000 2,300,000 600,000 £.5,000,000 The India Imports employed an active capital of five millions . At this period , there were at home , of goods sold and not paid for £.1,150,000 Goods in England , unsold , partly China , and partly India produce , £.6,440,000 , of which he should charge the India trade with one half 3,220,000 This made India commerce amount to upwards of nine millions . With regard to the Exports , the amount of the cargoes from England , not arrived at their destination , at the date of the quick stock account , was 3,580,000 Exports paid for , exclusive of Bullion 1,200,000 Silver exported and remaining 820,000 Impress and war allowances on ships out 450,000 Which gave , according to stock , by computation , in the whole £.6,050,000 Half of which belonged to India : the whole India concern , therefore , absorbed twelve , millions.—The China cargoes , homeward bound , the should estimate at three milli- 1166 ons ; those providing abroad were no where stated , but on an estimate of 1803 and 1804 , he should assume 3 millions , making together , 6 millions ; if , to this , he added 3 millions , being the moiety deducted from the India account before-mentioned of 6,050,000l. , it made the sum of 9 millions , which , added to the 12 millions , already mentioned , formed a mass of 21 millions sterling , of active capital , absolutely employed in the joint commerce of India and China . The hon . ex-chairman had next stated , as part of the dormant capital , the value of East-India house , warehouses , & c. £.992,200 Dead stock purchased 100 years since , and still remaining in the Company 's accounts £.400,000 The total of these items which , however , were not all that might be charged to the trade , the committee would perceive , was upwards of 21 millions : he was aware that some of the items might probably he subject to dispute ; he would , nevertheless , take what had been repeatedly acknowledged , and , he rather thought , by the noble lord near him ( lord Castlereagh ) , that the commerce of the East-India company required tour capitals , or about four-and-twenty millions sterling . For although India goods were paid for before manufactured , he believed many of the English goods exported , were bought upon credit , and the bills drawn from India and China ; the latter particularly supplied the capital to a very considerable extent.—The alderman then proceeded to complain of the very small portion of the manufactures of this country , which this immense capital enabled the Company to export to India , and the inconsiderable British tonnage employed in this trade . The number of tons , he stated to be , not more than 20,000 out , and the same home ; and the merchandize for the last 11 years , by referring to the papers on the table , 5 millions ; or , on an average , below 500,000l . per annum : — Was this small and contemptible proportion of the national exports our natural share of the trade
