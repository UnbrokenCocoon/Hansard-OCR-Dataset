might receive useful information from them , and profit by their advice ; you will not hear them now , when you have the leisure for going into a full investigation of the case , without danger of mischief to the colonies from the delay of decision , as well as with the least injury to the interest of the shipowners . When this investigation might be pursued with the least possible inconvenience to any individuals , and with the least possible risque to the public interest , you refuse to enter upon it ; you wait until an application shall come to you from the West Indies , accompanied perhaps with an assurance that the colonies are starving , that an insurrection is apprehended every hour , that immediate instantaneous relief can alone avert a public calamity ; that is the opportunity which you will take for hearing the ship-owners expatiate on the nature of the trade , and on the possibility of going from hence with provisions to the West Indies ; that , it seems , will be the time for going into the investigation of the whole matter , into a discussion of the best means for regulating the whole system of supplying the West India colonies , by means of British shipping ; then it is that the season will arrive for hearing counsel , and collecting evidence , and balancing the advantages and disadvantages of adhering to , or relaxing the navigation laws . Ministers , undoubtedly , will enter into this cool deliberate discussion with great advantage , under the pressure of a sudden and immediate necessity , when the colonies are starving ! Undoubtedly the ship-owners will then be entitled to a favourable hearing , when the question is not ( as now ) one of general prospective policy ; but simply whether the governors of the West India islands ; under the stimulus of immediate want , shall be permitted to let in supplies from America ! Why , sir , to say to gentleman who use this argument , that there is nothing in it , to expose to them the fallacy of it , I am sure is needless ; thy know it is fallacious , they know it full well ; but they want to evade 718 the present proposed enquiry ; and they hold out to the ship-owners and merchants , whose interests are to be sacrificed by this bill , a prospect of indulgence , to be granted to them hereafter , at a moment when they know that the necessity will be so urgent as to preclude the possibility of deliberate investigation . One main proposition upon which this bill is to be supported is , though not in terms , in substance , this ; that an urgent , local necessity can be judged of by those who are at a distance , better than by those who are on the spot . I ask , whether it can be necessary to do more , than state this proposition , in order to shew its absurdity ? But even this absurdity is only subsidiary to that other of which we have been speaking , the notion that the ship-owners will be heard to most advantage when the necessities of the West Indies are immediately under discussion before the privy council . It is plain , that if you hear the ship-owners now , your whole policy may be governed by their statements ; you will learn from them what they can do upon proper encouragement , what means they possess if it should be thought fit to bring them into activity , for meeting the necessities of the plantations . If they can shew that their means are equal to those necessities , or can be made so , then this bill is wholly unnecessary ; if they can do so only to a partial extent , then the bill would require modifications conformable and commensurate to that extent . It may be said , no doubt , that the prospect of commercial gain may lead men to promise more than they can perform
