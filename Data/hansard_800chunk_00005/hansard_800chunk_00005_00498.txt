Wallace , T. moved , that the house should resolve itself into a committee to consider of the Administration of civil Justice in Scotland.â€”The house having accordingly resolved itself into a committee , the noble lord said , that no man could more deeply feel the importance and difficulty of any subject than he did that upon which he now rose to address their lordships . Feeling , however , as he did , all the difficulty of the subject , he felt it at the same time to be his duty , after fully and maturely considering it , to submit certain propositions to their lordships , the objects of which were to remove evils and inconveniences which had arisen to a great height and which loudly demanded a remedy . His attention had been called to the number of appeals in that house , particularly from Scotland , which had increased to such an extent , that their accumulation , and the consequent great delay in their decision , became a most serious evil to suitors in that high court , and was disreputable to its jurisdiction . In considering this subject , his attention was naturally turned to the court of session in Scotland , from whence so many of these appeals came , and there he found also that the business had accumulated to an extent which produced the most material evils to the suitors , from the unavoidable delay which occurred in deciding causes .

He did not mean , and he trusted he should not be understood to mean , to throw the slightest reflection upon any of the learned judges of that court ; but it was his opinion , and it was the opinion of many persons of great experience and knowledge of the laws , that speaking generally justice was better administered in a court where the judges were only 3 or 4 in number , than where they consisted of a greater number . There were many reasons , which would naturally occur to their lordships , why this must necessarily be the decrease of business in the other ; thus case . It was also of the highest importance that the conduct of judges in their respective courts should , as in this part of the united kingdom , be
