charge any individual with a criminal misapplication of the public money : I am only desirous to do justice , and to ascertain where the fault lies ; and I believe the Barrack-master-general will turn out to be a very ill-used man , in the delay of settling his accounts . appealed to the house , whether government could be said to have lost any time in proceeding on the suggestions of the Report of the Military Commissioners . He had himself made a distinct statement to the house on the subject of that report . He did not deny the right of a member of parliament to interfere with the enquiry delegated to the commissioners . He only appealed to the hon . gent 's discretion ; an appeal of which , after what he had just heard , he should be inclined to doubt the success . recommended to the hon . gent . to substitute the word `` buildings '' instead of `` barns , '' and to make the motion general . thanked the hon . gent. , but would defer that till another day . The question was then put upon the first motion and agreed to . The hon . gent . then moved , for a `` copy of a letter to the late secretary at war , dated 29th Dec. 1805 , from the then Barrack-master of Sandown bay division , inclosing proposals on , the part of Mr. James Day of Brading , for the building of a Barrack at Brading '' wished the hon . gent . would explain to the house what . was the object of his motion , and the nature of the letter . observed , that he was prepared to give an answer , but he thought he was entitled to the papers , Upon the grounds he bad already stated .
