on the 30th of April , 1806 , will be 30,873,455l . From this sum ought to be subtracted 3,151,064l. , ( being the amount in possession of the commissioners for the redemption of the debt , on the 30th of April , 1805 , ) and the balance will give 27,722,391l. , for the net debt of India , on the 30th of April , 1806 ; of which sum , the 1072 amount bearing interest , appears to be 24,250,824l.—When this debt , however large , is compared with the assets in India , and with the value of the forts , houses , warehouses , & c. in India , ( valued in No . 23 , p. 78 , at 9,994,208l. , all necessary for carrying on government , which have cost money , and would cost money to the company 's successors , whoever they might be , supposing the transfer of the territory ever to take place , ) and when to these sums are added the amount of the company 's claims upon government for money expended in India , on account of the public , it may fairly be stated , that the actual value of the property of the East-Indite company in India , exceeds the amount of their debts.—I am aware of an error in this statement , as in this view of the debts and assets , the amount in the possession of the commissioners of the sinking fund ought to be subtracted from the amount of the quick stock , on the 30th of April , 1804 . But there is an error also in the assets . The quick stock is estimated only to April 1804 , and is stated , in p.72 , to amount to 17,252,399l . But in the calculation of these assets , there is an omission of 12,48,600 pagodas in the cash at Fort St. George . It appears by the paper , No . 19 , p. 63 , that the balance remaining in the different departments at Fort St. George , on the 30th of April , 1804 , was 57,19,605 pagodas ; whereas credit is given in the account of the assets to the same period , for only 44,71,005 pagodas . The difference between these sums ought to be credited to the assets in April 1804 , viz . 12,4.8,600 , or 500,000l.—The additional sum in the hands of the commissioners of the sinking fund , on the 30th April , 1805 , ought likewise to be added to the assets calculated to that period . The sum stated , in p.48 , to be in the hands of the commissioners for the reduction of the debt on the 30th of April , 1804 , is Ct. Rs . 2,80,00,563 . On the 30th of April , 1805 , it is Ct. Rs . 3,15,10,648 Difference to be added to the assets calculated up to April 1805 35,10,085 In estimating the assets to April 1806 , it is proper to add to them the sum which will be in the hands of the commissioners of the sinking fund in April 1806 , viz . Interest upon the sum of 3,15,10648 current rupees , for one year , from April 1805 , to April 1806 , at 8 per cent. , is about 25,00.000 1073 To the assets then , as they stood in April 1804. viz , £17,252,399 Must be added the sum at Madras omitted 500,000 The additional sum stated to be in the hands of the commissioners of the sinking fund , in April 1805 351,008 The interest upon 31,510,648 , Rs . or £3,151,064 , for one year to April 1806 250,000 And the total of the assets , in April 1806 , will be £18,353,407 This view of the Debt and assets of different descriptions , however , is taken only as a general one , and not by any means to be relied upon . Measures undoubtedly ought to be taken to reduce the amount of the debt ; but if , from circumstances , those means should be impracticable , this general
