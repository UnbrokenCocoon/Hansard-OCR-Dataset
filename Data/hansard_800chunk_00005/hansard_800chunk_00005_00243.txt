If he did not find credit for his statement before proceeding to prove it , he knew he should do so when the documents were laid before the house . He felt much obliged to the right hon . gent . for moving for these papers , or any others which could throw additional light on the subject , and should certainly second his motion . He must state , that it would take a very considerable time before the papers could be produced ; a delay winch would principally arise from the state of the accounts themselves . He had therefore made the necessary enquiry as to what a papers could be produced this session ; and , after the hon . gent . 's motion should be assented to , he should move for the production of such papers . Part of his plan he might thus be obliged to postpone till next Session , keeping in view , however , the necessity of the immediate adoption of that part of it which regarded the balancing of the accounts every year , in the same manner with mercantile houses . Any delay , however , he assured the house , should preceded , not from an idea of abandoning the plan , but from a wish and expectation of being able to bring it to greater perfection . said , that as no objection had been , or was to be made to his right hon . friend 's motion , there were but two points on which he would trouble the house with a very few observations . From the manner in Which this business had been stated by the noble lord in that house , an idea , had gone abroad , that the sum of 450 millions , which the noble lord had mentioned , was , for the greatest part , arrears which were recoverable , and it had , caused a great sensation in the mind of the public .

The noble lord had found fault with his right hon . friend , for having complained , of the tone in which he had delivered himself ; he had said , `` an expression might be explained , a mistake corrected ; but as to a tone , he could not answer for it . '' He ( Mr. Perceval ) thought , on the contrary , a tone might be explained ; for , when a person was speaking either sarcastically or ironically of another , a great deal of force and energy might be given in addition to the words used , by the tone in which they were uttered . The second point was , he thought Mr. Trotter had reason to complain of the noble lord , who had described him as the manufacturer , purveyor , store-keeper , comptroller , and auditor of his own accounts ; and that after all this accumulation of relations , he had the modesty to charge 10 per cent ; [ Here lord H. Petty said , across the table , `` No ; I deny the modesty . '' ] He had , how ever , at this time , no profits on these several heads ; for , from 1801 , these profits had been cut down by the member for Cambridgeshire ( Mr. Yorke ) , then secretary at war , to 10 per cent . only . The noble lord had since explained , that what he meant by `` auditor of his own accounts '' was , that there was nobody to audit them ; he submitted to the house , that there was a great difference between the statement and the explanation . He wished the noble lord to give
