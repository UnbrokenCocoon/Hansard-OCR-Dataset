discreetly than the governors of the islands could ; or perhaps I should say , that the privy council would make a more discreet use of their power than any other body of men would , supposing them to be equal to others in information upon the facts on which their power was to operate . But I doubt the possibility of their being able to possess that knowledge which will be requisite for the due discharge of the functions with which this bill is to invest them ; for the question is not a question of dry , abstract competency , in the privy council , to do justice to any trust that may be reposed in them : upon that none of us can entertain any doubt ; but unless you place them in a situation in which their Competency may come into action , that competency can be of no use to them , or to the public , I do not know whether they can do more than my lord Camden did , whose instructions to the governors of the islands have been so often alluded to in the discussions which have taken place on this subject ; and here it is observable , that whatever power you may give to the privy council , whatever responsibility you may attach to the privy council ; however you may take away the responsibility of 996 the governors ; however you may affect to take away their discretion ; it is most manifest that they must act on their discretion , while they have any power to act at all ; for this bill will not alter the necessity under which they are to act . They must , after all the instructions which you may give to them from hence , act according to their discretion upon the circumstances of the case , as circumstances may arise ; and you must indemnify them too , just as you did before this bill was thought of ; and for the same reason you always did it , because it is impossible to avoid it . This has been verified by the fact ; for when power was in the hands of the privy council , to regulate the whole of the trade between America and the West India colonies ; when it was infinitely important that the privy council should exercise their authority ; and when they did exercise their authority , an act of parliament passed for the purpose ; when the directions of the privy council were sent to the governors of the West Indies ; when that power , so given to the privy council , and by them delegated , necessarily and unavoidably delegated to the governors of the West India islands ; and that power , so delegated , was abused by some of those governors still the power was not taken away , but left with those same governors , even although it was abused by them—why ? Because parliament knew it was impossible to take it away . But now , instead of allowing the governors to act upon their own conviction , you are going to order them what they are to do beforehand , when you may not possess the information requisite for the purpose ; and when , after all your directions are given , they must , in many cases , at least , act upon their own discretion , even though it should be contrary to the orders of the privy council . I should say , that if this bill were passed , and the privy council were acting under its authority , there might be circumstances in which it was not less the duty of parliament to institute an enquiry on that account ; because although the power may have been granted by the legislature , yet a question might arise upon the propriety of its continuance —and a question might arise , whether the discretion should be left with the privy council or with the governors ? —Supposing that the legislature did not take pains to make a proper inquiry in the first
