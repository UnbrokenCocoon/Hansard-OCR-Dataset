Saadut Ali Cawn , to the Rohillas , and to lieut . Anderson , should be paid to the 1st of March , but the other arrears charged to the governor be struck out , and no longer considered as a demand of this government on his excellency : That a resident should remain at his excellency 's court ; but it being a system now positively and declaredly established , that the company should not interfere in any respect in the details of the vizier 's government , strict orders should be sent him neither to interfere himself , nor suffer any interference , for any public or private claims of British subjects or persons under our authority ; and that the whole management of the vizier 's country should be left to his excellency and his ministers , and no appeals from any of its inhabitants be received by the company 's government . `` —That the said governor- 373 general marquis Cornwallis in council did , afterwards , in a letter by them addressed to the secret committee of the East-India company , dated on the 16th of August 1787 , state , `` that the satisfaction of the nabob vizier at the conduct and conclusion of this negociation had been expressed in a letter addressed by him to the governor-general , a copy of which , as well as of the kistbundy executed by him , were inclosed ; that , upon the whole , they had every reason to affirm that it would prove the foundation of a permanent connection between him and the company , being concluded upon principles of mutual advantage to both ; and that notwithstanding the renunciation of the large claims of the company 's government upon the nabob vizier , it must in a pecuniary light be deemed beneficial to the company ; and that the negociation would appear conformable to the spirit of the company 's instructions regarding the conduct of their government to the nabob vizier .
