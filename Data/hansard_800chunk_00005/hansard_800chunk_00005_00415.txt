As to the apointment of the commissioners , the right hon . gent . had Stated that an additional nine had been permanently appointed , whereas the appointment was only temporary , and particularly applicable to the circumstances of the case , as the accounts were , from neglect , in such a situation , that nothing but such a measure as this could bring them into the condition in which they ought to be . He concluded by moving that the house should the next day go into the committee . asked When the noble lord in- 610 tended to bring forward his general plan for auditing the public accounts , as he would then prove to the house that there was no foundation for the charges of negligence that had been brought against the late administration ? said , he booed in a very few days he should be able to bring forward the bill to which the right hon . gent . alluded . gave notice , that he would tomorrow move for certain accounts , which would he necessary to throw a light on this subject . moved that the order of the house of the 22d of April last , relative to Indian papers , should be obeyed forthwith .
