those estimated by me for the future , 14,668,119l . The general commerce of the country is improved equally with the revenue . It appears , by the public documents before this house , that the commerce of India is now able to supply the China market so effectually , as nearly to preclude the necessity of sending bullion to China ; and large stuns in specie are now imported into India from that country.â€”After the view which I have taken of the general situation of the affairs of the East-India Co. in India , I hope that it will be found , that their debt , although large , and certainly pressing in a very great degree upon their prosperity , and upon the attention of those who have the management of their affairs , is not of a magnitude to create any danger ; that it appears , that there are means of reducing it , at no very great distance of time , to a moderate amount , and that , under the auspices of the noble lord ( Morpeth ) , by a just attention to the system of economy which he has recommended , and by reverting to the system and scale of establishments fixed in 1802-3 , with such augmentations as the change of affairs has rendered necessary , and as I have already described , the revenues of that great empire will be found to afford ample means . of restoring the finances . said , he greatly pre- 1083 ferred the situation of India at present , to what it was in 1798 , and had such confidence in the benefit that would result from the territorial acquisitions made by marquis Wellesley , inasmuch as they had left no footing for Bonaparte , that he would invest all his property , had he ten times what he possessed , in India stock . had a statement in his hand which he had reason to believe to be correct ; the only mode of ascertaining where the error lay , was by comparison ; it was impossible then to enter into the detail ; it might be done upon the report . rose , and declared , that he could not allow the committee to rise without first delivering his opinion , at great length , on the alarming aspect of the company 's affairs , whom he declared to be in a state of absolute insolvency .
