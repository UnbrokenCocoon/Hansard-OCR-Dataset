in a considerable degree ; and he , therefore , thought it fair to allow , at least , a million and a half for arrears of military charges not yet brought to account . This sum would make the debt , on the 30th of April , 1806 , after deducting the amount of the sinking fund , 30 millions 1158 sterling . On the accumulation of this debt , he observed , that , in 1793 , it had stood at . £8,074,865 In 1798 , when lord Wellesley 's government commenced , at 11,032,645 And in 1806 , including the arrears above-mentioned for expences in 1805 30,000,000 So that the accumulation of the Debt , during lord Wellesley 's government , would be about 19 millions , instead of 16 millions , besides a sum paid off from 1799 to 1805 , by bills on England of 2,532,195 making , altogether , the increase of the Debt , in the 8 years of his lordship 's administration , about 21½ millons sterling . How this vast sum had been expended , was a question that required particular investigation , before it could be accurately answered . It was a question of very serious import . Clear it was , that the hon . general 's method of accounting for it was not satisfactory , because he had supposed a considerable part to have been incurred by borrowing money in India to supply investments to Europe ; which supposition was shewn , to be groundless by the statements Mr. Grant had exhibited . Doubtless , a very large proportion of the Debt had been occasioned by the expenses of the military expeditions undertaken in India , at the desire of the king 's government , by the wars we had carried on there since the year 1798 , and by the larger balances which the extended scale of our affairs had placed in the various offices and departments of the different presidencies . The increasing Interest on the Debt would , alone , account for the absorption of a large sum of the resources of government . In 7 years , from 1791–2 to 1797–8 , there had been paid , for interest , on the Indian Debt £3,688,000 In 7 years , from 1789 to 1804–5 , the amount of payments for interest is 9,000,000 Making an increase for the payment of Interest in the last 7 years , of 5,440,000 With regard to the debts termed optional , they were understood to be a class of debts contracted since the year 1800 , and amounted , For Bengal , to £5,022,000 For Madras 1,000,000 Both making £6,022,000 The characteristic of these Debts was , that the interest as well as the principal was payable in England at the option of the lenders , and both principal and interest at rates of exchange which rendered it probable , that payment of them might he demanded in England . All the other Debts 1159 were in a certain sense optional , the principal being also transferable to England , but at a rate of exchange which made it improbable that the holders would avail themselves of that option . Undoubtedly , the contingency of being liable to be called on in England for the payment of only six millions , though any such demand could only come in the course of some years , and so not without affording time for preparation , was a very serious contingency , which ought to be looked at with the other considerations belonging to this subject , unquestionably most alarming , of the Indian Debt.—The great question which now called for attention , was the liquidation of this enormous Debt . It was of a magnitude which left all former example far behind , and , unless means were taken to reduce it , the interest alone must overwhelm the affairs of the company . A plan for this purpose was necessary , and immediately necessary . It should be the first object of consideration , and of any such plan the first principle must be a retrenchment of our expenditure
