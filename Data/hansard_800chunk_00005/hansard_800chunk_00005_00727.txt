, it is to be hoped that its amount , considering all the circumstances which have con- 1081 tributed to raise it , will not prove , that the company 's affairs have been managed in an improvident manner ; and that the public will see , in the general situation of the company 's finances , ample means of reducing this debt to any amount that may be deemed advisable.—If the mode proposed of drawing a proportion of the debt to England be adopted , and the saving of interest , which will be the result of this operation , be added to the annual interest calculated to amount to 250,000l. , upon the principal now in the hands of the commissioners for the redemption of the debt , this revenue alone will make an impression upon the debt , which must soon reduce it to the level to which every body wishes to see it reduced . Notwithstanding the large amount of the Debt , and the embarrassments occasioned in India , at different times , by the great demands for the various services which were in progress , the company 's credit was improving from the moment of lord Wellesley 's arrival in India , to the moment of his departure . On the first of June , 1798 , the 12 per cent . paper in Bengal bore a discount of ¾ to ¼ per cent . ; on the 29th of July 1805 , the 12 per cents . were all paid off , and the 10 per cent . paper bore a premium of 4 per cent . In June 1798 , the 8 per cent . paper was at a discount of front 12½ to 13¼ per cent . ; in the beginning of 1805 , the 8 per cent . were at par , and would have continued so , if it bad been possible to send out specie from England at an early period in the season . In July 1805 , they were at a discount of from 3¼ to 3¾ per cent . ; in June 1798 , the 6 per cent . paper was at 21 per cent . discount ; in 1805 , the 6 per cents . bore a discount of only 8¼ per cent . —This improving state of the credit is to be attributed to the public confidence gained by the regularity and publicity of all the financial operations of the government , by the measure of establishing funds at Fort St. George and in Bengal for the redemption of debt ; and by the judicious measures adopted for the improvement of the revenue.—The amount in possession of the commissioners for the redemption of the Debt , on the 30th of April , 1805 , as appears in p. 90 of the printed accounts , is 3,151,064l. , which sum , at 8 per cent . interest , will give nearly 250,000l . per annum for the reduction of the Debt.—The improvements effected in the revenue during . lord Wellesley 's government also deserve notice . Exclusive of the increase of 1082 revenue , by territorial acquisitions , and by subsidies , it appears , that every branch of the revenue of 1798 , under the Bengal government , which , in the five preceding years had decreased to the amount of 234,519l. , was improved , under lord Wellesley 's government , as follows : 1798 1803-4 Increase .
