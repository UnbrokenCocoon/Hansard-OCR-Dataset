accounts had long served as a shroud and a veil , behind which the most flagitious malversations had been screened from detection and punishment , while it hung , like a gloomy cloud , over the heads of honest and conscientious men , who were rendered unable , in the lapse of half their lives , to obtain a settlement of their accounts , and a final exculpation of their conduct . Among the many instances of this lamentable deficiency , was the late lord Macartney , a man whose character , for honour and integrity , would ever stand justly . high in the annals of his country . While he was governor of Grenada , during the American war , a sum of 70,000l . stood charged as an expenditure under his administration ; and though he survived to a very advanced age , he was never able to have his accounts passed ; a great number of persons , from similar causes , and impediments thereby created , in obtaining balances due to them , had been prevented from making good their titles to estates purchased for them , and were thereby subjected to the most ruinous and embarrassing losses . Having gone 301 through these statements , the noble lord next proceeded to submit the outline of his remedy for these glaring evils : In the first place , he said it was proposed to repeal both the acts under which the present commissioners of accounts were constituted , and to appoint , under another act , ten commissioners , for the purpose of auditing and controlling the army accounts ; and the better to enable them to direct their investigations with effect , it was proposed to arm them with the authority , which the present commissioners had not , of compelling all persons , connected with the disbursements of public money , to furnish their accounts ; these to be distinct from the West- India commissioners ; and also of another distinct board of comptrollers of military expenditure , constituted upon a plan similar to that established under lord Godolphin , whose duty it would be to examine , in the first instance , all army estimates and accounts ; to watch over the expenditure of military funds ; to act as the confidential advisers of the board of treasury , in all applications of money for military purposes ; to report such frauds as they should be able to discover ; to have the power of calling before them all persons in any degree connected with the military expenditure , and of examining them upon oath . With respect to the ten commissioners of accounts , none of whom were to be members of parliament , it was proposed to separate them into three distinct boards , the one consisting of four members , and the other two , of three members each ; those boards to have communication with each other , as they might find necessary for the general advantage of the examinations referred to them ; but by no means to mix the objects respectively committed to them . The whole body of accounts in arrear were to be separated into three distinct periods . One of these boards to commence with the public accounts from , the first of December last , and to bring them up clear to the latest period . The next board to take up the investigation of the 167 millions now under enquiry ; and the third , to take up the examination of all that body of other accounts that have never yet been called for . By this means , he trusted that the whole of that immense mass would be gone through with the utmost possible expedition , and the affairs of the country , in these respects , placed upon some regular and satisfactory footing . To the chief of each board , a re- 302 sponsibility would be attached for the correctness of each account audited ; for the want of which responsibility in the members of other boards , considerable disadvantages had arisen to the country .
