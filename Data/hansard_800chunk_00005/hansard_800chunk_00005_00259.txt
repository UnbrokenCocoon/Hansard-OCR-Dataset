such reduction to he employed ; all this notwithstanding , the said marquis Wellesley , in furtherance of his iniquitous designs of territorial aggrandisement , extortion , and plunder afore-mentioned , did , between the month of July and the 12th of Nov. 1799 , as well himself as by and through the means of the said William Scott , by him thereunto moved and instigated , directly interfere in the internal government , in the household affairs , and in the appointment of counsellors and ministers of the nabob vizier , and , in terms the most peremptory and arrogant , dictate unto him the said nabob vizier such a reduction of his military establishment as would have left him no troops over whom to exercise authority , and as would , according to the remonstrance made by the said nabob vizier , have left him `` no authority whatever over his dominions or his subjects ; '' and , finally , did threaten to march , and actually made preparations for marching , large bodies of the company 's troops into the territories of Oude , to be maintained at the expence of the nabob vizier ; avowing at the same time , that the nabob vizier would be unable to make good such expence , without disbanding his own troops ; insomuch , that , at the epoch last-mentioned , namely , on the 12th of Nov. 1799 , wearied with unceasing importunities and threats ; thwarted by the frowardness of his Aumils and others thereunto stirred up and encouraged by the said marquis Wellesley ; disgusted with a system of interferences , of dictation , of reproof , and of insult , by which he was exhibited as a slave in his own capital—the said nabob vizier did make unto the said marquis Wellesley a proposition for the abdication of his throne , for the placing his son there on and for retiring himself to a distance 384 from his capital ; his intention , as it afterwards appeared , being to make in person an appeal to the justice of the king and the parliament in England .
