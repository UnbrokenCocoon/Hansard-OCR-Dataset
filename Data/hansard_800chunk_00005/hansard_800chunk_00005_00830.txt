by parliament , in such proportion as it might be required for remittance to India . The money to be raised in the first instance like any other public loan , and paid over to parliamentary commissioners , charged with its application to the reduction of the Indian debt , who should be authorized to receive the annual interest , together with the one per cent . sinking fund payable on account of the same , out of the Indian revenues , to be strictly set apart and paid over to them , or their order , in the precise order of payment , ( that is , immediately after the Military Charges are provided for , and in preference to all other civil or commercial demands whatever ) which is now by law provided in favour of the creditors of the Company.— This proposition might at first sight appear open to many objections , and seem to realize at once the prophecies of some gentlemen , that the distresses of the Company were become such as had at length compelled them to come to parliament for relief ; but he denied that it was at all open to such a comment any more than the system which had been acted upon uninterruptedly for the last ten years with respect to the loans raised for the service of Ireland , even before the union . The amount annually required being invariably comprehended in the British loan for the year , was in the first instance Secured upon the British consolidated fund . It was then paid over by the British to the Irish treasury ; the Irish treasury being bound to remit to the British treasury in each year , the Interest and Sinking Fund , till the whole capital thus created on account of Ireland was paid off.—In proposing a similar arrangement with respect to the Company , the committee would hold in mind , that the proposition in no degree originated with the Company , that it was merely the suggestion of an individual , not founded 1238 upon any existing failure of means in that body to meet , without the aid of parliament , every claim upon them , but offered for consideration as a measure calculated without loss to the public to add 800,000l . a year to the Company 's income , and thereby obtain with more certainty for the public their annual participation of 500,000l . to which in the event of an adequate surplus existing abroad , they are entitled.—It really appeared to him that the public were even more interested than the Company in this measure , as their prospect of participation would be thereby at once improved so much , as to be placed nearly beyond the reach of failure ; whereas the dividends to the proprietors were already secured , but both the public and the Company would largely feel the benefit of it , in the effect it would have in ameliorating the finances of an Empire in which they have a common interest , which is the only British possession that has never yet in war been a charge out the mother country , except so far as its naval protection is concerned , and which has ample means of sustaining itself , in all future wars , from its own resources , if wisely administered , and upon principles not less enlarged and liberal than those which have been already acted upon with respect to other leading branches of the empire.—That the general inducements in the present case were not less strong , and the risks not greater than in the precedent of Ireland , he thought might be successfully contended . As to the extreme case of either Ireland or India being lost to the British crown , he thought it one not to be contemplated in regulating one 's decision upon a financial question of this nature . Parliament had not formerly suffered such a consideration with respect to Ireland , nor would they now suffer it with respect to India , to divest them from an important and beneficial measure of general policy
