I have shew is that no situation in which this country can be placed can ever require such powers to be given to any body of men in it ; I have shewn the intolerable insult which it offers to the British shipping by placing it below that of a foreign state ; I have shewn the ruin which will attend an attempt to put in force any thing like the extent of its provisions . Is it then , after all this , is it too much to ask of a British house of parliament , not to destroy the 1007 best interests of the British empire by destroying its navigation , and that without the regularity of an inquiry ? If you thought the thing was of no worth , you ought to observe more decorum in the destruction of it . If gentlemen will contend it is improbable the privy council will exercise improperly the power to be given to them by this bill , I answer that the prospect is not flattering in that particular , by the disregard and contempt which you have shewn for the law already ; when you yourselves will not venture to define the use which you intend to make of the power when you have obtained it , and when you spew that you regard your colonial system as an artificial and constrained system ; so that , after this , there may be a total abandonment of the old system of the navigation laws . Sir , if ever there was a time in which it was the duty of parliament to guard against the introduction of these destructive principles , by which the navigation laws are threatened with annihilation , and more particularly against giving any persons in the state the power of producing that effect , the present moment is that very time ; and I think that the necessity of caution is considerably increased by the very arguments which have been urged in support of this bill to-night . Good God ! sir , what has been the ground on which this bill has been defended ? Ministers are determined , it seems , to carry every thing by storm ; for they do not reason on the wisdom or the policy of the bill , but they recommend it to this British house of parliament , by shewing that it is of the same kind as other acts of hostility which have , at different times , and under different circumstances been committed against the navigation laws of G. Britain ; so that the recommendation to the bill is , its resemblance to those measures which are hostile to the navigation laws ! I say , that if this bill should pass into a law , a foundation will have been laid , by which ministers may come to parliament with any claim which the intoxication of successful power may dictate or suggest . They may think it necessary to relinquish the whole system of your naval strength ; there is nothing which may not be justified under this bill ; and , if any body should attempt to resist the extravagance of the application , they have nothing to do but to hold up this bill and say , `` see here , the powers which the legislature has con- 1008 fided in us ; we must have this measure ; it is essential to the system which parliament has delegated to us in its wisdom , '' to which , I know not what answer any one could make.â€”Sir , I had much more to add , but after having trespassed on the patience of the house so long , I must pass it over . I can only express a confident hope that parliament ( a British parliament ) will not hold out such a spectacle to the world as the recognition of such a principle as this bill contains , world be : which would be only doing that by a law of your own which your enemies , aiming at your destruction , have hitherto endeavoured in vain to accomplish
