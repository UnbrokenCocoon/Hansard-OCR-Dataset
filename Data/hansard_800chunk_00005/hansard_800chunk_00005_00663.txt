early add provident determmation to carry forward its means of strength and power , with all those circumstances of wealth and splendour which must ever have the effect of exciting jealousy and creating enemies . It has been the policy of those laws to require our commerce and our marine to grow up together . This principle of wholesome restraint has caused them to rise and flourish together , and they have alternately , as cause and effect , perhaps , accelerated each other 's progress . To say that no circumstances can ever justify a partial and temporary relaxation of those laws would be absurd ; but in proportion as the growth of any marked disproportion between the trade and the shipping of the country must render an adherence to them difficult , and perhaps a recurrence to them impossible if once fallen into disuse , I do consider it of the first importance to watch with the utmost jealousy , and to mark with the strongest disapprobation , any thing which seems to bear so much the appearance of an unnecessary , precipitate , wanton , and apparently systematic infringement of those laws as the present measure does.—The house will recollect the efforts made by the French government at several periods of its history during the monarchy , to incorporate the principle of our navigation laws into their system . The ministers of France perceived to what cause the naval greatness of Britain was in fact assignable ; they wished to imitate it , but happily they had postponed the attempt too long . Their commerce had long taken the start of their shipping : they could no longer make their trade the instrument of forcing forward their commercial marine without a early extinguishing the trade itself : and they were obliged , after several fruitless efforts , wholly to abandon the attempt . This ought to make us cautious how we trifle 983 with this important system , for purposes of small and speculative commerce . If , as there is but too much reason to apprehend , there is some tendency at present in the shipping of the country to advance less rapidly than our trade ; let us avoid aggravating this evil . The necessity for relaxation of the law on the score of commercial Convenience must , if this defect in our system continues , be increased , whilst the danger of yielding them will be augmented also . Our trade under a moderate restraint may , and will speedily , relieve itself by forcing capital into the means of its own accommodation ; but if the want of shipping is once suffered to prevail beyond a certain extent , the demand can no longer without great national loss await the supply . The barrier will then be thrown down which now protects our commercial marine , and from that moment America and other countries that can build and equip cheaper than we do , Will possess themselves largely of our carrying trade ; ship-building in this country will cease to be a profitable application of capital ; our seamen will decline in number ; and many even of those we have will pass , particularly in war , into the service of America.—I know doubts have been entertained whether our shipping can be equal in time of war , when so large a proportion of our seamen are withdrawn from the merchants and employed in the king 's service , to accommodate us in peace : the trade of the country , I am inclined to think , considering the proportion of landsmen in the navy , and the powers of re-production we possess , whilst the demand for seamen is kept up , that little difficulty will occur in this respect ; but I am persuaded our means must always be abundant , for at least supplying our own colonial trade in all its branches , into which no foreign ships ought to be admitted , no more than into our coasting trade , or transport service . Whatever temporary deficiency there may exist of British shipping , it will adjust itself
