or dexterously misstated the purport of this amendment . He has argued against it as if its avowed object had been to prevent , the passing of this bill during the war ; and he has told us that , in his opinion , the time of danger is the properest time for the display of additional courage and magnanimity . The noble lord has illustrated his proposition , ( according to the custom of the treasury bench , when argument is wanting , ) by a story , the authenticity of which it is not necessary to question , of some wise and gallant individual , who appears to have obtained a great share of the noble lord 's admiration , by replying to a person who asked him `` What he would do if he were on the top of Salisbury steeple ? '' `` That he would do on Salisbury steeple precisely the same thing that he would do on Salisbury plain . '' This reply the noble lord considers as fraught with wisdom and magnanimity , and as affording a brilliant example to parliament and to the country . In point of wisdom , perhaps , it is not easy to decide between the person who asked the question and him who answered it . It may be matter of surprize , indeed , that the answerer did not reply to the querist by another query , namely , `` Why in God 's name he should go to the top of the steeple at all ? '' What it was that he was to do when he got there , the noble lord has not condescended to inform us , nor would it perhaps he becoming to suggest ; but among the few functions which a man in that situation could possibly perform , there does not appear to be any one which is peculiarly worthy of the imitation or attention of the house , or which might not have been performed with as much advantage and satisfaction in a horizontal direction upon the plain as in a perpendicular one from the steeple . But however splendid this individual achievement may have been in the noble lord 's opinion , he must see that as an illustration it is not good for much , unless it be the noble lord 's intention to contend , not only that we ought to behave with steadiness and courage in time of actual danger , but that it is expedient to create dangers , and to place our , selves in situations of peril , purely for the sake of exhibiting our magnanimity . Such would be the failure of the noble lord 's argument , even if applied to the question as he has argued it , of commencing this system in time of war : but the object of the amendment being , as has been stated , to suspend the operation of the system during future wars , it would be difficult to make out any claim of magnanimity on our part 545 for inflicting on posterity evils which we do not encounter ourselves.â€” What objection can reasonably be offered to this amendment we are yet to learn . To the principle of it the right hon . gent . ( Mr. Windham ) has subscribed , when he admitted an extension of 3 years ' service in the case of discharger ; becoming claimable during war . This admission is of itself sufficient to acknowledge the necessity ; but it is not sufficient to remedy it . On the other hand , it breaks in upon the certainty and definiteness in the term of service , which the right hon gent . has urged as the main advantage of his whole system ; it breaks in upon it sufficiently to destroy the inducement arising from it , at the same time that it does not meet the evil , the apprehension of which alone can justify any such infraction . Quitting , however , the narrower ground of the amendment immediately before us , the noble lord has gone into the more general topics
