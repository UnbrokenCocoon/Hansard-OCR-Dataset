true , indeed , he stated no fixed opinion upon the subject ; but he stated his mind to be in doubt upon it , and if his mind doubts whether the policy of this measure would not be applicable to a time of peace , we can have but very little hope that he or any of his colleagues will consent to institute an enquiry into the possibility of dispensing with it during war . The house will do well to consider that it is now called upon to adopt a measure , the principle , of which is to legalize the suspension 709 of that system of navigation law , which has long been felt not only in this house but out of it ; not only in this country but out out of it ; not only in Europe but over all the globe , to have been the foundation of all our naval power , of our real strength , of all our greatness , from which is derived our glory ; which has made us what we are , the admiration and envy of the world ; a system adopted and followed up by the wisdom of our most enlightened ancestors , and recommended to our regard and veneration from the benefits which we have uniformly derived from it ; benefits which other nations are endeavouring to grasp from us , and which such measures as these will tend to fling into their hands . Sir , these are serious considerations , and if ever there was a period when the policy of such a measure as this could be particularly doubtful in point of time , the present is that period . The world supposes at least , that there are at this moment many serious points , points of the greatest delicacy , connected with our colonial monopoly , and our belligerent rights as affecting our navigation system , depending between us and America . What can be the prudence then at this time , of adopting any measure which shall shew , that our principles of policy , whether respecting our colonial or our belligerent rights as connected with our navigation system , hang in any degree more loosely about us , than they did at any former period ? Whatever may be the sentiments of government on the measures which may arise out of these points so under discussion , whatever may be the disposition or the determination of his majesty 's government on the subject of them , if contrary to every state policy which has always guided us , our government is about to make concessions ( which I trust is not the case , though I fear it is ) on the subject of that main bulwark of our strength , and foundation of our power , our navigation laws and our colonial system , policy requires that they should not betray a less regard for those laws , and for that system , than was felt by our ancestors . For they will render the sacrifice which they may be prepared to make of less value by sheaving the light estimation in which they hold what they concede , and will purchase less returns of gratitude or other considerations for what they sacrifice . But if on the contrary this system of our policy is intended to be upheld ; if at the time we insist upon upholding it , we appear by our conduct to undervalue it ; our adherence will be attributed to our pride , to our obstinacy , to our ill will , 710 to any thing in short but those true principles of just and rational policy on which alone our determination to adhere to it , ought to appear to rest.â€”In addition to this , sir , there are circumstances in the present time which I should think make the policy of this act of parliament the most dangerous that ever was , or ever could be adopted in this country . For what do gentlemen say in support of it ? they are loud to assert that for the last
