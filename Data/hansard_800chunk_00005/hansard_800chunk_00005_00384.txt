place out of the limits of the said nabob 's country , but where the said honourable Henry Wellesley resided , in the illegal capacity of lieut . governor of the territories which the same marquis had extorted from the aforesaid nabob Vizier of Oude ; there to receive the commands of the said marquis , through the said Henry Wellesley : thus treating , with an indignity due only to an inferior vassal , a prince , who , as well as his ancestors , had .ever and invariably manifested the firmest attachment to the Company 's government , and who was , therefore , entitled to particular distinction . —That the said marquis Wellesley having , by this humiliation and degradation , prepared the minds of the said nabob and the said regent his uncle , for the insulting proposals which he was about to make , did , by the means of , and in concert with , the said hon . Henry Wellesley , propose to the said regent , who was then sold administrator of the affairs of Furruckabad , the entire `` transfer of the civil and military administration of that province to the British government ; adding , that the said marquis had long been of opinion that was the only arrangement which could `` afford ultimate satisfaction ? '' and falsely alledging ( as the event soon after proved ) that the British government , in assuming the management of the country , proposed no advantage to itself beyond the security of its just rights and interests , and the interest of those dependant upon the state ; '' and insidiously urging , as an inducement for the said regent to promote the said marquis 's views against his master the said nabob , `` that he , the regent , might rely with confidence , that the acknowledged liberality of the British government would not admit of his interests being neglected ; '' by which means the said 565 marquis did secure the consent and co-operation of the said regent , who did accordingly declare , `` that he was ready to promote his views by all the means in his power : '' the said marquis having thus , by the promise of future reward , bribed the said regent to a traitorous surrender of the dearest interests and most important rights of his prince.—That the said marquis Wellesley having thus gained over Khenud Mund Khan , the uncle of the nabob , who , for upwards of six years , had been regent of the principality and sole administrator of the affairs of Furruckabad , and who possessed an influence in that country inferior only to that of the nabob himself , did , by the means of , and in concert with the said hon . Henry Wellesley , taking advantage of the defection of the regent , of the youth and inexperience of the said nabob , of his defenceless and unprotected situation , of his separation from his relations and friends , of his absence from his subjects , of his distance from his country , and of his being in his , the said marquis 's , usurped donions , surrounded by a great military force , and entirely in his , the said marquis 's power , did , by the means of , and in concert with the said hon . Henry Wellesley , make to the said nabob the same insulting and injurious proposals for a complete transfer of the civil and military administration of the principality : thus violating the spirit of the orders of the East India company , the resolution of the house of commons , and the acts of the British parliament ; and requiring a prince , whom it was his duty to support , to become the instrument of his own degradation , disgrace , and ruin , by the surrender of all his rights , and by becoming a pensioner on the bounty of the said East India company.—That the said nabob , being justly averse to this ignominious surrender , the said marquis Wellesley
