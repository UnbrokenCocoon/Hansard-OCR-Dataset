, beyond the charges , amounting to 4,181,559l . ; which , being deducted from the balance , before stated against London , leaves the sum of 2,858,206l. , which must have been borrowed in India , at high interest , for the purchase of investment.—It will be found , that the debt incurred in the 5 1075 years , from 1793 to 1798 , was £3,665,455 The increase of the assets in those 5 years was 1,088,365 Those in 1793 being 8,834,538 Those in 1798 being 9,922,903 And the actual increase of the debt , in comparison with the assets , was £2,557,090 In a minute which lord Wellesley recorded in June 1798 , he reviewed the state of the Finances in India ; and pointed out the real cause of the increase of Debt in the following words : `` From that paper it appears , that , allowing for a supply in the course of the year 1798-9 , to Fort St. George , of 75,00,000 sicca rupees , or 937,500l. , and to Bombay , of 25,00,000 , or 312,500l. , the deficiency for which provision must be made , in order to meet the expected demands at the three presidencies respectively , will be , in Bengal , 1,28,68,360 ; Madras , 43,45,351 ; Bombay , 41,67,611 . The total deficiency , therefore , at the three presidencies , together , will amount to sicca rupees , 2,13,81,321 , Or 2,672,655l . The immediate causes of the estimated deficiency , will appear obvious from the annexed accounts . By account No . 27 , the sums appropriated , in India , to the purposes of investments and commercial charges , in the years 1796-7 and 1797-8 , amounted to 4,96,15,165 current rupees ; having been , in 1796-7 , 2,30,70,125 , and , in 1797-8 , 2,65,45,040 ; and exceeding the amount of bills drawn upon the Court of Directors from India , within the same Period , by the sum of 3,83,39,263 current rupees ; the bills drawn on the Court of Directors having been , in 1796-7 , 79,88,699 , and , in 1797-8 , 32,87,203 ; and by account No . 3 , it appears , that the proposed investment , for 1798 , from all our India possessions , including the supply promised to Canton , amounts to 2,40,88,000 current rupees.—But the accounts Nos . 4 , 5 , and 6 , shew , that the total sum applicable to the purchase of investment from the revenues in India , and produce of sales of imports from Europe , was , in 1796-7 , 81,43,858 ; in 1797-8 , 96,44,550 , and is estimated to be , in 1798-9 , 78,20,133 . This annual demand , for the purpose of investment , upon a scale so far exceeding the annual means of the three presidencies , is the principal cause of the present deficiency.— The comparative view which I have taken of our expences and receipts , in examining the causes of our actual distress , sufficiently proves , that many of 1076 those causes are of an absolute permanent nature , and that most of them must be expected to continue for a considerable time ; that the investment , at once the most powerful cause of our temporary distress , the main spring of the industry and opulence of the people committed to our charge , and the active principle of the commercial interests of the Company , is more likely to be increased than to be diminished in any future year ; and , consequently , that the embarrassments of our finances must be progressive , if some means be not devised for aiding the resources of this presidency , which must now be considered as the general treasury and bank of our Indian empire , furnishing supplies for the services of all our other possessions in India , as well as a large and increasing proportion of the capital employed in the trade to Europe and to China.—The mode of supplying this assistance , which I would recommend , has already been suggested by the accountant-general ,
