underwent at the commencement of the present war , relative to neutrals trading to the enemy 's colonies . I am the more inclined to advert to this point from the conviction I feel , that the orders in question yet require to be very considerably further modified and restricted . The extent to which our belligerent rights are now systematically invaded , the facility afforded to the enemy by abusing our liberality towards neutral powers , to cover his own commerce , and to turn his whole maritime strength against us in war , and the cruel situation in which those employed in the naval service of the country are placed , when , by the artful and unprincipled practices of neutralizing merchants , they are not only deprived of almost all prospect of prize , but exposed to be ruined by litigation if they venture to detain the ships engaged in this illicit traffic , makes me peculiarly anxious to protest against any conclusive inference being drawn in favour of this or 981 any other system , merely from its having generally prevailed throughout the period of the last war ; and I urge this consideration with the more anxiety on the present occasion , from the extent to which it is understood America is disposed at this moment to push her claims on this score , in opposition to the undoubted maritime rights of this country . From the harsh and unconciliating manner in which she apparently has endeavoured to support those claims , and from the knowledge we have , that this vital question is on the point of being discussed by his majesty 's ministers with the government of the United States , than which certainly a more important discussion never devolved upon any government , we are to hope they will conduct it with all the temper and friendship , which is due to a state with whose prosperity our true interests are so inseparable united ; but with that resolution and inflexible firmness , With which it is their duty to defend rights , the maintenance of which is indispensable to our preservation as a maritime state , whilst America , in pressing their abandonment , can only plead a commercial interest of a very subordinate kind , unsupported by any colour of justice whatever.—If the necessity or expediency of this bill can not then be made out when its application is reasoned on in its more limited sense , and if its enactment in the more enlarged meaning which the wording of the bill justifies us in applying to it , can not be reconciled with any sound view which can be taken either of former regulations or our general interests , I wish to warn the house of the value and importance of those principles , which this measure in its most comprehensive character goes to shake . I am led the rather to do so , as I have understood that language has been held with respect to our navigation laws , by persons of great authority in another place , which fills me with considerable alarm . I have heard they have been spoken of as laws rather suited to the former situation , than to the present circumstances of this country , and I can not but forebode from such sentiments , explained by such bills , and illustrated by such practical opinions as have been stated by a secretary of state is this house , that if there exists not in the present government a deliberate purpose to violate , there at least exists a great in- 982 difference to uphold the fundamental principles upon which those ancient aws were founded.—I know it has been the fashion in modern times to deny its restrictions upon commerce . The economists laugh at the notion of compelling your commerce to be carried in native shipping , if it can be carried by the shipping of other stares on better terms . But those who have attentively studied the rise of this nation into greatness and security , will not hesitate to attribute it , under Providence , to its
