accusation against one of his majesty 's judges , it might reasonably have been expected , that the articles of complaint presented against him would have been framed upon great deliberation , and with scrupulous caution ; the more especially from the extremely harsh nature of the charges themselves , and the delicate situation of the person , to whom guilt was thereby imputed ; —for all which considerations , the great length of time which had been suffered to elapse , after the conduct complained of was alledged to have taken place , and before any charge was made , had afforded more than sufficient opportunity ; notwithstanding which , the said articles were altered in the beginning of next sessions , and particulars of complaint were then presented to your lordships , containing a new charge of a very aggravated nature , which , with several other articles , not fewer than five in number , have been since withdrawn.—That early in the sessions of 1805 , a committee of your lordships was appointed , which every peer had a right to attend , to consider of the matter alledged against your petitioner , and of the evidence which might be brought in support of the same ; at which time your petitioner was again compelled to forego the discharge of his judicial duties , and to at- 754 tend upon your lordships for the purpose , as he hoped , of being then allowed to enter upon his defence ; but was then prevented a second time from appearing in his own defence , by the nature and constitution of the said committee , at whose proceedings it was not permitted to him , nor to any person employed on his behalf , to be present.—That after a considerable part of the said sessions had been employed in examining into the matters then alledged against your petitioner , and after several witnesses had been examined in support of the charges theretofore preferred against him , to your petitioner 's very great surprise , the matter of complaint against him was again altered , new modelled , and changed , by withdrawing several of the particulars of complaint which had been before presented , and most strongly insisted upon as highly criminal , by amending and changing , in material parts , those that were suffered to remain , so as to make them different in their nature and effect , and by introducing then , for the first time , other charges altogether new ; by means of which continued fluctuation of complaint , your petitioner was involved in the most cruel perplexity , and became utterly uncertain what the charges might be against which he might ultimately have to defend himself ; whilst his character was in the mean time deeply wounded by this apparent multiplicity of charges , thus publicly and solemnly presented to the highest court of judicature in the realm , as grave and solemn matters of just complaint against one of his majesty 's judges.—That on the 22nd May 1805 , it was moved , that an humble address should be presented to his majesty , to remove your petitioner from his office , grounded upon such new , altered and amended charges : whereupon your lordships ordered , `` that your lordships ' house should resolve itself into a committee of the whole house , upon the motion made for an address to be presented to his majesty , to remove your petitioner from his office of judge , and to enter into the facts alledged on the said motion . `` —That on the 31st May 1805 , and on various subsequent days , during the continuance of the last sessions , one of the charges stated by the motion , contained in the petition of Wm . Armstrong and others , was proceeded in at your lordships ' bar , when no further progress was made , than to examine the witnesses produced in support of the facts alledged in the said petition ; in the course of whose evidence it appeared , that your petitioner 's 755 accusers
