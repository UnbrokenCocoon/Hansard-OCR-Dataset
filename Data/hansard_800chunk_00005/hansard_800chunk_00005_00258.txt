nabob vizier , as well as in defiance of the law before cited , which he the said marquis Wellesley was solemnly bound to observe , adhere to , and obey.—That , with respect to the disbanding of the troops of the nabob vizier , it was in the treaty of 1798 afore-mentioned . Settled , and agreed , that `` the said nabob vizier should possess full authority over his household affairs , hereditary dominions , his troops , and his subjects ; '' and that , in another part of the said treaty , it was settled and agreed , that , `` Whereas by the engagements now entered into be- 382 tween the nabob vizier and the company ; the amount of the subsidy is considerably increased , and many other permanent charges upon his excellency are incurred ; upon a comparison of his disbursements with the assets ( or pecuniary means ) of his country , it becomes necessary to make such reductions in the superfluous charges , servants , & c. as may be requisite and are consistent with his excellency 's dignity and convenience ; and to that end the said nabob agrees to consult with the company 's government , and , in concert with them , devise the proper objects of such reductions , and the best means of effecting them . `` —That , in a letter from the secret committee of the court of directors aforesaid to the governor-general and council , dated on the 15th of May 1799 , it is stated , that , seeing the difficulties which the nabob vizier had to encounter , as afore-mentioned in the letter of sir John Shore , bart. , they the said secret committee are `` not surprised to find , by the last accounts , that an arrear had accumulated in the payments of the kists , to the amount of 18 lacks of rupees ; that , lord Mornington having represented , however , that he believes the nabob vizier is sincerely disposed to make every possible effort for the liquidation of this arrear , as well as for introducing such a system of order and economy into the management of his finances , as will enable him to be more punctual in his future payments , they the said secret committee entertain a well-grounded expectation that every cause of complaint upon this head will speedily terminate ; observing at the same time , that the large , useless , and expensive military establishment within the Oude dominions , appears to them to be one of the principal objects of economical reform . '' That hence it doth manifestly appear , that , even agreeably to the hard terms of the treaty of 1798 , and to the subsequent instructions of the secret committee , the disbanding of the troops of the said nabob vizier had in view no object beyond that of leaving him the means punctually to discharge the stipulated kists ; that , in the extent of disbanding , reduction , or reform , due attention was to be paid to the dignity and convenience of the nabob vizier ; and , in the execution of the measure , the nabob vizier was to be the principal , he having agreed merely to consult upon the subject with the company 's government , and having , in the express terms of the treaty aforesaid , re- 383 tained `` full authority over his household affairs , hereditary dominions , his troops , and his subjects . '' But that , notwithstanding the obvious meaning of the stipulations and instructions aforesaid ; notwithstanding the arrear before-mentioned had been fully paid up , and all the subsequent kists had been paid to the day , and even the day before due ; notwithstanding the nabob vizier had , in strict conformity to the treaty , not only shewn a willingness to make a reform in his military establishment , but had urgently besought the company 's government with him thereon to consult , and in concert to devise proper objects of reduction , and proper means in
