that the British West India islands , in cases of an adequate necessity , should hereafter receive supplies of provisions and lumber from America , as they have heretofore done , even in American bottoms , why propose a law to enable the privy council to permit the importation into our colonies , not only of previsions and lumber from America , but of every description of produce , even manufactures , as the bill was first introduced , from every state in amity with the king ? And further , why permit the unlimited export in return of all articles of colonial produce to any such states , thereby at 973 once giving to the king 's ministers a power not only to suspend the navigation laws , but to abrogate totally our Colonial system ? —When this measure was before under consideration , I endeavoured to expose the false pretences upon which it proceeded , and to point out its total inefficiency when viewed in its more limited character , namely , that of placing this qualified intercourse upon a more regular footing , to answer even the purposes for which it was professedly introduced . If it was really intended that the governors abroad , in opening the ports , should act not upon their own immediate judgment , as applied upon the spot to circumstances of local necessity , but upon instructions previously obtained from home , as those instructions must be in their nature of a general and permanent description , and not arising out of any temporary exigency , why have not ministers declared what their intended system in respect to the islands is to be , and applied to parliament for the powers absolutely requisite for carrying the same into effect , before they call upon us thus blindly to intrust the whole to their discretion ? But if the only instructions that can , or at least ought to be given , are those of his majesty 's late ministers , viz . directing the governors to enforce strictly the salutary regulations of the existing laws , except in cases of real emergency , how can it be pretended that his majesty in council can ever here judge either of the circumstances or the time when such a pressure exists in any of our West India islands , as to render a temporary relaxation necessary ? This bill can not then alter either the nature of the discretion , or the hands in which its exercise must practically rest . The West India governors must decide when the ports are to be opened , as they have always done , unless the king 's ministers are prepared to say they shall be constantly open with or without necessity : and if not , the question then is , whether a discretion to open them when requisite , is most likely to be prudently exercised when it is used under the impression of subsequent controul , and indemnity : or under a previous authority given , enabling the governors lawfully to suspend the navigation laws at their will and pleasure , without being subsequently amenable to parliament , as well as the crown , for their conduct ? The effect of such a bill can on- 974 ly be unconstitutionally to transfer from parliament , hereafter , to ministers , the power of granting indemnity , and watching over the conservation of this fundamental law.—But if this measure , in the limited sense I have hitherto considered it , is not sustainable , or the motive for its introduction intelligible , it assumes a much more serious shape , when viewed in its true and more enlarged sense , as manifesting . I fear , a general relaxation of opinion on the policy of our navigation system , and mixed with , perhaps , a disposition at the expence of that fundamental law , unwisely , to court and conciliate the government of America at the present moment.—I lament the absence of art . hon . secretary of state on this occasion , not only from the cause which has unfortunately occasioned it
