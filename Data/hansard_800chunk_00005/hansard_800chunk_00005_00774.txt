the statements on the table would support the hon . gentleman 's allegations in respect to loss on the sales . The amount of profit on sales ending 1st March , 1805 , Mr. Grant observed , was , by the printed account on the table , No . 25 £1,172,779 And the charges of all kinds were per said account 1,591,319 Leaving an apparent deficiency of £418,540 But among these charges , were several articles which did not belong to the commerce , and were entirely of a territorial nature , such as political charges on account of the territory £267,249 Military ditto 112,234 St. Helena charges are stated at £76,013 But the average of 3 years is only 63,000 13,013 The total of these is £392,496 Leaving a deficit of only £25,924 And this might fairly be placed , also , to the political charges , because the settlement of St. Helena answered political purposes , as well as commercial , and a part of its charge ought justly to go to the former head . It would be unfair , however , to judge of the result of the Company 's Commerce by the last year ; because the imports from India , in that year , were most uncommonly small , the receipts from thence having been 1154 less than the estimate in the Indian accounts of 1804–5 , in the sum of 41,78,282 rupees ; and the sales also were , from the unsettled state of Europe , much more unfavourable than usual , as would appear from reverting to the accounts of former years . In 9 year , from 1795 to 1803 , the average of profits was £1,397,971 In 5 years , from 1799 to 1803 , it was 1,677,517 In 2 years , in 1804 and 1805 1,185,307 Difference short , in the average of the 2 last years , per annum £492,210 The hon . gent said , he should have occasion , in the sequel , to notice some other things , advanced by the hon . gent . ( Mr. Francis ) ; but , in the mean time , would address himself to the statement of accounts between India and Europe , which the hon . general had delivered in his speech , on the former night . By that statement , the hon . general made the commerce with Europe to be indebted to the territorial revenue , from April 1798 , to April 1804 , in the sum of £3,578,590 And , from April 1793 , to April 1798 , in 2,216,032 Both £5,794,622 To which if the interest on these sums were added , it would be 2,407,839 Making a total of £8,202,461 He did not question , that the hon . general was satisfied as to the accuracy of the statement he thus brought forward ; but it would be found to be extremely erroneous . In an account drawn up with great care at the India House , which he ( Mr. Grant ) had occasion , in a former session , to produce to the house , and which he now held in his hand , the debits and credits between Britain , on the one hand , and India and China , on the other , from the year 1788–9 to 1802–3 , forming a period of 15 years , stood thus : Total amount of supplies of goods , stores , and bullion , to India and China £43,353,837 Ditto , of payments in England , on account of India and China 5,085,690 £48,439,527 Ditto , of receipts from India and China in goods and bills £46,973,820 Ditto , of receipts in England , on acct . of India 1,599,586 48,573,406 Balance in favour of India £133,879 In this account , every thing received from India and , China , in any way , was credited ; every thing supplied to them was debited . Goods lost outward bound were not charged to India and China ; but goods lost homeward bound , were placed to the credit of India and China . India had also credit for the
