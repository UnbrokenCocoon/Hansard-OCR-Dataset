spoke to order . He was surprised , after the speech the hon . gent . had made , and the subsequent motion to refer the papers to a committee , that he should interrupt the hon . admiral , who argued fairly from the papers before the house . One of the charges was , for not repairing ships in the merchants ' yards , and his hon . friend was only bringing instances to prove the ill effects of that practice . proceeded to shew , from a variety of examples , the enormous prices charged at the merchants ' yards , upon no less than 18 sail of ships , repaired in ten years from 1782 to 1792 , as a fair criterion to judge of the policy of employing them . In one ship the charge for repairs was 12,392l. , when the charge for building her new at the same time would have been only 7,943l. , For another , the repairs were charged at 10,395l . ; the building new would have cost but 6,374l . In two others repaired in 1792 , the charge was 39,730l. , when the price for building new would have been but 15,481l . ; and the total charge for repairs on the whole number was 252,607l. , when the building new would have cost 150,280l . This was the report from the navy board ; and these were the grounds upon which the noble lord had acted in his unwillingness to repair to 194 the extent so anxiously desired by the hon . gent . ; and he was still further justified by the example of the Powerful ; of which the building cost 31,230l. , and the repairs at Chatham 27,058 ; by that of the Lion , which was built new for 21,335l. , .and the cost for repairs at Chatham , in 1805 , as estimated by the dock-yard officers ; was 24,735l. , but the repairs actually came to 61,109l . ; and hence he trusted that lord St. Vincent would appear to have acted laudably and judiciously ; in declining to carry the system of repairs to the full extent . The next allegation of the hon . member was founded upon the discharging workmen from the dock-yards , which was termed a tyrannical proceeding , and one that banished our Ship-wrights to the dock-yards of the enemy . Now the fact , as proved from the documents on the table , was , that not a single man was discharged who was capable of doing any duty ; that many of the men who had been long in the habit of receiving the highest wages in the dock-yards were some of them actually blind , and others lame , disabled , and moving on crutches : those , to the amount of 327 men , to whom , in the year , 1800 , no less than 28,024l . wages were paid , were superannuated by lord St. Vincent . At Plymouth , 76 were discharged , of a similar description , to whom , in 1800 and 1801 , 10,943l . wages were paid . Now , some of these were put upon allowance greater than usual , amounting to 4,529l. , and others superannuated , upon allowances to the amount of 2,264l . 11s . The usual allowance of 20l . per ann . had , in those cases , been increased to 24l . ; and the allowance of 24l . to 28l . ; while to the rope-makers , and others discharged , to whom no such allowance had ever been usual , 20l . a year had been allowed . So much then for tyranny ; while , at the same time , in order to provide for the deficiency thus created in the number of artificers , apprentices to the number of 390 were taken , between 1802 and 1804 , and distributed among the best workmen in the yard ; many , or most of whom , were now able to take men 's births . This did not shew any inclination to strip
