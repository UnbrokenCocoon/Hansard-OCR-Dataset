end of the year 1803.—In consequence of the distribution made in the year 1804 , the duties of the provinces , on the coast of Malabar , which , in 1802-3 , had been performed by the army of Bombay , tell to the lot of the army of Fort St. George . These duties had always required eight battalions ; and , when , in consequence of the distribution which I have noticed , it had become necessary to remove the Bombay troops from those provinces to the northward , an augmentation of the army of the Fort St. George , to the amount of four regiments , became necessary . The regiment of cavalry to be supplied to the peishwah , also required that a regiment should be added to the establishment of Fort St. George . The duties which fell upon the Bombay army by the distribution of 1804 , required for the subsidiary force with the peishwah six battalions , for the subsidiary force with the guickwar three battalions , and garrisons for Bombay , Goa , Broach , Surat , and troops to occupy the territories of Guzerat and in the neighbourhood of Surat , ceded by the peishwah , and the guickwar , and conquered from Scindeah ; the detailed number for each of which services , it is not necessary to mention . It will be observed from this statement , that the additional services required from the armies of Fort St. George and Bombay , in the year 1804 , and at the present moment , beyond those required in the year 1802-3 , exclusive of the garrison for Goa , are one regiment of cavalry , and six battalions for the peishwah , three bat 1071 talions for the gwickwar , and troops for the conquered and ceded territories in Guzerat . Accordingly , the addition made to the military establishments , the expences of which are included in the estimate of 60 lacks , are one regiment of cavalry and four regiments of native infantry for Fort St. George , and one regiment for Bombay ; making , in the whole , ten battalions . No reductions of these establishments can , in my judgment , be made with safety . The total of charges , therefore , for a future peace establishment , including the charges of 1802-3 , and adding the civil and military charges occasioned by treaties of subsidy , and by the consequences of the Mahratta war , will stand thus : Charges of 1802–3 £10,656,834 Additional civil charges , rendered necessary by treaties of subsidy , peace , & c. 477,520 Additional military charges 705,000 Total future charges 11,839,054 The revenues , as before stated , will be 14,668,119 Leaving a surplus revenue of £2,328,765 From this sum must be deducted the interest of the debt , as stated in the account , No . 2 , page 93 , 1,823,040l . ; to which sum must be added the interest on the sum to be borrowed to supply the deficiency in the year 1805-6 , viz . 2,655,957l. , being at ten per cent . 265,595l . ; making the total interest of the debt , in 1806 , 2,088,635l . ; and the actual surplus , alter providing for every demand , will be 740,150l . In calculating this surplus , no credit is taken for any augmentation of revenue beyond 1802-3 ; although it is certain , that some branches , such as salt and opium , must be , and have been already augmented ; the revenues of the provinces gained by the peace , will also produce more than they have been estimated at . The actual Debt in India , in April 1805 , was , according to account , No . 1. p. 90 , 28,197,498l. , including arrears of establishments , debts not bearing interest , and demands upon the company of every description . To this debt must be added the deficiency of resource , as stated in page 93 , for the year 1805-6 , being 2,655,957l . ; and the total gross debt ,
