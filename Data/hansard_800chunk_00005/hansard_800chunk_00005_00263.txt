to which the vizier required the sanction of the British name , as the condition of his consent to a territorial cession . And his lordship directs that this unparalleled instance of rapacity and injustice , form a leading article in the declaration to be preferred by you , and transmitted for his lordship 's approbation . You will also communicate to the Begum , and to the other personages in question , a copy of his lordship 's reply to that part of the vizier 's propositions . His lordship has no doubt , that the knowledge or this transaction will fully explain the necessity of the company 's assumption of the civil and military government of Oude to those persons who are the objects of his excellency 's proscription . His lordship is also of opinion , that his excellency the vizier , either sensible of the disgrace , or apprehensive of the consequences of a public exposure of his tyrannical views , may be ultimately induced to accede to an equitable arrangement by a seasonable notification of this part of your instructions , and of its result . His lordship deems it not improbable , that the principal persons to whom the foregoing communication is to be made , may come forward with declarations expressive of their indignation at his excellency 's unwarrantable views , and soliciting the protection of the British government : in this event , his lordship directs that you will receive such representations , and transmit them immediately to his lordship . But the most noble the governor-general desires that you will not solicit or express any wish to receive any such representations . His lordship deems it of essential importance , that the receipt and substance of such representations should be parti- 390 cularly noticed in the proposed declaration . The communication above directed to the family of the vizier , and the principal persons of his court , will consequently precede the delivery of that document to his excellency the vizier .
