the chairman had leave to report progress , and to sit again.—At two o'clock on Saturday morning the house adjourned to Monday . The bills upon the table were forwarded in their respective stages ; among these , the West India Auditors ' bill was read a third time , and passed : and the Irish Mines , Gibraltar Postage , and Grafton Agreement bills , were read a second time . —Dissentient ; —First , Because , although according to the terms of the Resolution , it hath been proposed only to postpone the proceeding in this matter for two months , it hath been avowed by the noble lord who moved it , That the Resolution hath for its object , to put an end to all further investigation into the grounds of the motion made in this house , to address his majesty to remove the judge , touching whose alledged conduct the proceedings have been had in this house.—Secondly , Because it having been questioned in the course of debate , whether this house can legally and constitutionally entertain a motion for an address to remove a judge , on account of alledged misconduct in the execution of his office , before some proceedings have been had respecting the same elsewhere , we feel it incumbent on us to record our opinions , That it is the clear right of this house , according to the provisions of the act of setlement of the 12th and 13th of king William III . to entertain in the first instance , a motion for an address to his majesty for the removal of a judge , provided the facts alledged as the grounds of the address shall be sufficient to justify the proceeding , and shall have been proved to the conviction of the house.—Thirdly , Because , though it is unquestionably of great public importance , that the judges should fully possess the independence intended to be secured to them in their high station , it appears to us not to be necessary for the support of that inde- 789 pendence , and on the other hand , that it would be of the most mischievous consequence to concur in a resolution , which , upon the grounds stated for adopting it , has a tendency to prove that the conduct of the judges in the execution of their office , can not effectually , in the first instance , be brought under the consideration of the house of lords.—Fourthly , Because , we think it not only dangerous to the administration of justice , but injurious to the person whose conduct has been the subject of consideration , to stay the proceedings in a period thereof , where evidence hath been actually received in his presence and hearing , and now remains upon the journals of the house , which , unanswered , seems to us indisputably to prove misconduct of a very serious nature towards a jury , duly discharging their duties and functions according to law.—Fifthly , Because it hath been further alledged , and because proof has been offered to be given in support of such allegations , That the said judge in the exercise of his office , did conduct himself upon the circuit towards a jury at Lifford in a most oppressive manner ; that on several occasions in the course of the same circuit , he did impose arbitrary , excessive , and illegal fines ; that he did most unwarrantably calumniate the characters of magistrates , and other persons , and in a charge to the grand jury at Longford , did endeavour to bring his majesty 's government into hatred and contempt And it therefore appears to us , to be of the most evil example to refuse to examine the grounds of the above allegations , and to stay the proceedings in that stage of the business in which this resolution has been adopted .
