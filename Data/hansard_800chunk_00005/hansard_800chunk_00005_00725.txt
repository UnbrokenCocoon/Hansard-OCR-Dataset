the efforts which were undoubtedly made by the noble lord who , at that time , presided at the board of controul , and by my noble friend lord Castlereagh ) , and by the Court of Directors , to send out larger sums.—By a reference to the papers before this house , it will be found , that the total amount of the sums laid out in investment , from April 1798 , to April 1804 , was £9,619,348 Supplies to China 1,761,263 Of advances to the King 's and to the Company 's chartered ships , in the same period 448,931 Making a total advanced in India , up to 1804 11,829,542 In making up the account of the sums advanced in India , on account of the home concern , the following must be added : —Advances for Ceylon 1,182,472 Making a total advanced , for the home concern , up to April 1804 £13,012,014 The total actual amount of the supplies received in India by the sale of goods , in bullion and stores , and for bills drawn on the directors , in the same period , appears to be 9,864,086l . The balance is 3,147,725l . for which London is indebted to India . It may be said , that the Company had a right to expect aid from the territorial resources of India ; that the revenues have increased since April 1798 ; and that the financial distresses which existed at that period , were very soon removed.—The events which have occurred since April 1798 , must be recollected . The first of these , in point of time , was the war against Tippoo Sultaun ; at the same time that a large army was put into the field on the frontiers of Oude , to oppose Zemaun Shah . The army of Fort St. George did not return to its quarters till the month of Dec. 1799 ; and , in the month of May 1800 , the army of Fort St. George was assembled again , and put down the rebellion of Doondeah Waug . Before this service was completed , an expedition was fitted out against Egypt ; and , in a very few months after the troops had returned from Egypt , the armies of Fort St. George and Bombay were assembled and increased , in consequence of the disturbance in the Mahratta empire.—Besides all this , the pay of the king 's and company 's troops , serving under Fort St. George , was increased ; and the civil and judicial establishments , under that government , were placed on a more just scale than they had been before.—During these great and extensive military operations , a variety of others were necessarily carried on in different parts of the peninsula , each 1079 of which had a tendency to increase the military charges.—According to this statement , it appears , that a very considerable proportion of the debt in India had been incurred at different times , by the purchase of investment . If the account between the revenues of India and the Company had been kept in the form of a merchant 's account , or in the manner in which the East-India Company keep their account against the public , the interest upon each sum borrowed for the commerce of the company , would have been carried to account against them from the moment at which such sum was borrowed.—In this view of the case , the interest , at 10 per cent. , upon 2,858,206l. , being the amount laid out in India beyond supplies from England , and surplus revenue previous to 1798 , would be , annually £285,820 And , for eight years , to 1806 2,126,560 The interest upon the sums borrowed , since 1798 , each for their respective number of years , to 1806 633,005 Making a total of £2,759,565 It is evident that all these sums have been charges upon the revenues , and of course have contributed to swell the amount of the existing debt.—There is also in the amount of the debts incurred during lord Wellesley
