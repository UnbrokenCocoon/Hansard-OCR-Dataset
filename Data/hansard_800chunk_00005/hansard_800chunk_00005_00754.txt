and , finally , declaring that the commons conceived it their undoubted right to order the attendance before that house , to be examined touching any matter before the house , of any peer , not being a peer of parliament , or having a place or seat in the house of lords . The earl of Limerick observed , that this resolution contained matter of the highest importance to the peerage of the United Kingdom , and he therefore trusted their lordships would take it into their consideration 1121 on the earliest possible day . On his lordship 's motion , the resolution was ordered to be taken into consideration on Thursday , for which day the lords were ordered to be summoned . The first reading of the Masters in Chancery bill was moved by lord Eldon . expressed his warm approbation of the bill , the object of which was to make an adequate provision for several persons of eminent ability and enlightened minds , to whom the country were every day essentially indebted , for the able and upright discharge of the duties of their offices . The country were also indebted to his noble and learned friend ( lord Eldon ) , for the choice he had made of many of those who now filled the office of masters in chancery ; a choice the more pleasing to his noble and learned friend , as those whom he appointed , while they possessed in an eminent degree every qualification that could fit them for their offices , were , at the same time , his private friends .
