the truth , when he said that there was near one million of fresh ways and means now wanted by the noble lord , to make as ample a provision for the expences of the year as he intended to do when he opened his financial statement . One other in- 637 stance of disappointing the expectations which might have been raised , he said he would mention , and that applied more particularly to the right hon . secretary for the war department ( Mr. Windham ) . When he came into office , he said , it might at least have been expected that there would have been no useless legislation , no tinkering of acts of parliament , no marks of the laborious effects of a blind Cyclops , in the framing of them ; as the disappointment of this hope he should content himself with referring to the miserable bill before them . These topics , he said , might be much enlarger upon , many similar ones might be mentioned and others seemed to be opening upon them in the remaining business of the session ; and he should indeed be happy to see , when the session was closed , a correct collection of these and similar instances , in which the inconsistency of the conduct of the administration with its professions might be seen it might be stiled a Florilegium on the beauties of the present administration . He trusted , however , that from what he had mentioned ; from shewing how the promise of a comprehensive principle in forming their administration was illustrated by the exclusive and prescriptive one on which it was formed ; how their love of liberty , by uniting the judicial and the executive character in one ; their moderation in the use of power , by their conduct to the East India Company ; their economy , by the new and unnecessary military expenditure their pensions to convicted and retiring judges ; the unnecessary extent of their intended increase of commissioners for auditing the public accounts ; and their abstinence from all useless and clumsy legislation ; by the slovenliness and uselessnes of this and others of their acts of parliamentâ€”he said he trusted from all this , he should appear to have done no more than justice to the administration , when he had styled them a government of most splendid pretence , and most inadequate and contemptible performance . Yet this , he said , was that all-wise administration which they had been promised ; this was the administration , uniting all the talents and all the virtues of all parties , which was to shame all former administrations by contrasting its wisdom with their folly , its competency and energy with their inefficiency and weakness , its purity with their corruption , its economy with their profusion , its love of liberty and moderation of power with their unconstitutional and arbitrary abuse of it . This , he said , was the proof of those benefits from an 638 united and comprehensive administration , which so many well-meaning , but shortsighted men thought they could anticipate ; it was for this that the consistency and character of public men was sacrificed and abandoned ; it was for this the public was to look for a compensation for that distrust of the sincerity of the professions and principles of all public men , which such unprincipled coalitions necessarily produced . There was one advantage indeed , he said , that was derived from this broad-bottomed administration ; they were not as yet sunk by the load and weight of the accumulated errors and absurdities of which they had been convicted , `` a weight to sink a navy , '' a weight which must long ere this have sunk any administration which did not derive an uncommon buoyancy from its broad-bottomed formation . He said he had been led regularly , nay , necessarily , into the consideration of the general character of the administration on the discussion of this particular measure ; because this measure proposed to give to his majesty powers over
