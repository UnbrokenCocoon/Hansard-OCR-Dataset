himself driven from his home and his country with the rest , his forts were taken possession of by the conquerors , and all his estates and property of every kind confiscated.—That thus was the said rajah Kakoor Addkeerin , zemindar of Cutchoura , a descendant of the ancient princes of Hindustan , after being insulted with the most humiliating and barbarous proposals , attacked by a powerful army in his own fortress , driven from the country where his ancestors had for many generations lived in princely grandeur , to wander as an outcast among strangers ; his son , his dewan , his commanders , and great numbers of his vassals , most wantonly and most inhumanely massacred , and the rest dispersed or taken captive ; his villages laid waste , his fields ravaged , his forts seized , and all his possessions for ever wrested from him , and confiscated for the use of his avaricious , his unprincipled , and his relentless destroyers.—That all these acts and proceedings , so disgraceful to the British name , so openly in violation of all law , so repugnant to justice , and so shocking to humanity , were committed towards persons over whom the said marquis Wellesley had no just or legal controul , from whom he had no right to exact allegiance , and who owed no obedience to his commands , but who were , in law and in fact , the subjects of the nabob vizier of Oude ; the said marquis having most iniquitously extorted the countries in which these deeds were acted , from that unfortunate and despoiled prince , and exercising in it , in the name of the East-India Company , an unlawful , despotic , and usurped authority.—That , the said acts and proceedings having been committed either by the said marquis Wellesley himself , or by persons whom he had illegally appointed , and for whose conduct he was responsible , or by persons who acted under his orders , and for whose actions he was accountable ; and the 1036 said marquis having been regularly and duly informed of the said acts and proceedings while they were in the course of commission , and not only having never discountenanced , prohibited , or censured them , but , on the contrary , having formally approved them , and publicly thanked those by whom they were committed ; the said marquis is justly chargeable with all the said acts and proceedings.—That , in all and singular of the above recited acts and proceedings , the said Richard Colley marquis Wellesley has been wholly unmindful of the solemn engagements of duty to the East-India Company , to his sovereign , and to his country , by him entered into ; has daringly contemned the parliament , the king and the laws , and dishonoured the British nation and name ; and has therein been guilty of high offences , crimes , and misdemeanours .

But it was not proposed to extend this allowance to the field-officers of the militia : the reason of which was , that , from the constitution of the militia service , they were necessarily men of considerable property , besides what arose from their pay . He then moved for leave to bring in a bill , to amend the acts of the 42d of the king , as far as related to the pay of militia officers . expressed his astonishment , that so great a state-question , as whether the captains in the militia should be on a different footing from those of the regulars , should be brought forward at such a late period of the session , when most of the militia officers had retired from the house to their military avocations .
