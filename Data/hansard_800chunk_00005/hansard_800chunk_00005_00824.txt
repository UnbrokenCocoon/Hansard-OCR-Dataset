increase had taken place , partly from tracing the funds borrowed abroad to their probable destination , partly from a general but intimate persuasion that the Capital itself , even with the increased amount of the Company 's floating securities , has gradually become unequal to the extent of their commerce ; under the progressive increase of charge at which from the effects of war and other causes it has latterly been in common with all other operations necessarily conducted ; but still more from a detailed examination of the extent and situation of the funds themselves , as distributed throughout the various branches of their trade . If he was right in his general position , it could not well be disputed , indeed it would be rendered less doubtful from some statements which he should subsequently refer to , that the funds requisite for this purpose had been raised abroad , and so far disadvantageously from the high rate of interest at which they were obtained , a practice which certainly nothing but a case of extreme necessity could in a commercial point of view justify.—This naturally led to the 3rd point of enquiry , which had been gone into at some length by his honourable friend the late chairman ( Mr. Grant ) and also by another hon . friend of his ( sir A. Wellesley ) viz . Whether upon the Balance of Funds passing between India and Europe for a series of years back , India stood indebted to Europe , or Europe to India ? The former had stated the account between Europe on one side , and India and China on the other , and upon three several periods of 1228 years ; viz . of 15 years , of 10 years , and of 7 years . From these statements the result was , that in the 15 years the accounts nearly balanced ; on the 10 years the balance was about 2,400,000l . in favour of India , and upon the last 7 years , there was a balance the other way of about 536,000l.— The hon . general had taken somewhat a different view of the question . He had stated the same sort of balanced account between India on one side and Europe and China on the other , from the commencement of lord Wellesley 's government in 1798 ; in order to shew , that India had supplied considerably more than she had received , and that down to April 1804 the increase of Assets , and the excess of her Supplies to Europe and China beyond the value received , nearly balanced the extraordinary funds raised . These two statements seem to lead to opposite conclusions . The first to establish an inference that the commercial treasury at home derived no aid of any consequence from abroad during the period in question , and the latter to establish a different inference . The two lead at once to the main practical question ; namely , for what purposes were the loans raised abroad , and to what have they in point of fact been applied ? It could not be expected that in a discussion of this sort , any very precise analysis could be given of so intricate an enquiry . He should , however , state generally his impression to the committee on that important point.—The first obvious fact that attracted attention upon an inspection of the Company 's affairs , was the great increase of the Debts since the renewal of the charter : Indian Debt , April 1804 22,536,207 1793 8,074,63 Actual Increase 14,461,342 Estimated Increase to April 1806 , about 6,000,000 Total Increase £.20,461,342 Debt in Europe , March 1794 7,006,500 1805 6,012,196 Total Decrease £.994,304 Increase in India 20,461,342 Decrease in Europe 994,504 Net Increase £.19,467 ; 038 In considering to what purposes these Funds have been applied , it has already been stated that during the 4 years ending . 1229 in 1802 , no loss , but on the contrary a profit took place on the Company 's trade . The same fact is corroborated on a more extended
