fact . He proposed , therefore , that the proceedings should be put into that form in which as in England an issue might be joined , that the pursuer should state distinctly the facts which he alledged , that the defender should 733 either distinctly admit or deny those alleged facts in whole or in part , and that thus issue being joined on the record , it should be in the power of the chamber in possession of the cause , at the request of either party , to direct a trial by jury on this of fact ; that the chamber might also , without being applied to by either party , direct such trial by jury , and might also remit the cause to the circuit , to be there tried by a jury . There were inferior courts , such as those of the sheriffs and bailies , where the expence of a trial by jury might be much greater than the value of the object in dispute ; he thought that it would be advisable , therefore , only to allow of a trial by jury , in those cases where it was directed by one of the chambers , on application of either of the parties . It would also be necessary to give a power of appealing to the decision of the chamber directing the trial by jury , in cases of mis-direction of the judge to the jury , or where the verdict was given in contradiction to evidence . In this way he conceived that the introduction of the trial by jury into civil cases in Scotland , would be productive of the most important advantages . The third head of the plan related to appeals , with respect to which it was proposed , that there should be an immediate court or review between the chambers and the House of Lords ; still , however , not in any degree violating the act of union , by trenching upon the jurisdiction of the court of session . It was proposed that an appeal should lie from each of the chambers to the court of review , which should consist of all the lords of the court of session , except those of the chamber in which the decision appealed against should be made ; that an appeal should lie to the court of session , without the necessity of going through the intermediate forms now used , of bills of advocation and suspension . That the court of review should proceed with printed cases , and hear counsel , in the same manner as in appeals in the House of Lords ; that an appeal should ultimately lie from this court of review to the House of Lords , but from no other court ; and that such appeals should be only against final judgment , and not against interlocutory judgment . It was also proposed , that , in order to prevent frivolous and vexatious appeals , that the house should have the power of awarding cost to a much greater extent than at present . It was , too , notorious , that many appeals were brought to that house with- 734 out any hope of ultimate sucess , but merely with a view of gaining a certain advantage from suspending for a time the execution of the judgment given in the court below . This advantage might , in some cases , over balance any consideration of costs which could possibly be awarded against an appellant ; he had , therefore , framed a resolution , but he had at present so much doubt about it , that he would not propose it among the other resolutions ; the object of which , however , was , that in cases where , notwithstanding execution being issued on the judgment in the court below , the appellant might , nevertheless , in the event of a reversal of the judgment , be placed in the same situation as if such execution had never issued ; that then the court below should certify to that house ; and
