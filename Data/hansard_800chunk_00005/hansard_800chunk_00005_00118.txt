were no less ( including the ships in ordinary on 1st Oct. 1801 , ) than 120 sail of the line which stood in need of repair.—And here I beg to enumerate the numbers , under each head , or class of repair required , and under the various official denominations : 172 14 required very large repair , 38 large repair , 14 between middling and large , 22 middling , 12 between middling and small , 16 small , 4 very small ; total 120.—I shall now , sir , enumerate the number of ships of the line actually repaired by earl St. Vincent , between Oct. 1801 , and May 1804 , as taken from the account ordered to be printed July 3 , 1805 , and which account the house will understand is not confined to those paid off by his lordship , but relates to the whole of the navy repaired.—Of the 14 under the head of very large repair , not one was repaired ; of the 38 under the head of large repair , 5 were repaired ; of the 14 between middling and large , none were repaired ; of the 22 middling , 4 were repaired ; of the 12 between small and middling , 3 were repaired ; of the 16 small , 10 were repaired ; and the 4 which required very small , were all 4 repaired ; total 26.—So that it appears that earl St. Vincent during a period of 2 years and 8 months immediately succeeding . the war , repaired no more than 26 sail of the line , the greater part of which were those that required the least repair ; although his lordship must have known that there were full 120 sail of the line which stood in need of repair , and that the ordinary did not afford any resource.—But , sir , the proportion of work performed by earl St. Vincent in the 2 years and 8 mouths , to the whole quantity of work necessary to be performed , before the 120 sail of the line could be put into a complete state , falls far short of the proportion of 26 to 120 ; for the greater part of the ships repaired , were , as I have already stated , such as required the least to be done to them ; and I have , for the information of the house , ascertained , what proportion the actual work performed by earl St. Vincent bears to the whole.—The expence of workmanship for each denomination of repairs will accurately determine the proportion one bears to another ; and which expence , I believe , will be found upon an average as nearly as possible , on the following calculation for a 74-gun ship . I conceive it necessary to be thus minute , as , in bringing forward charges of so serious a nature , it is but reasonable that those who may be disposed to take upon themselves the defence of his lordship , should see the precise grounds on which the charges rest . The expence of workmanship may be reasonably estimated at , 14,000l . ; Large Repair , 10,500l . ; Between Middling and Large , 8,000l . ; Middling , 5,500l . ; Between Middling and 173 Small , 3,500l . ; Small , 2,500l . ; Very Small , 2,000l.—Now , sir , the whole expence of workmanship for the repairs actually performed by earl St. Vincent agreeably to this calculation , would amount to 118,000l . The expence in like manner on the ships in ordinary in Oct. 1801 , and the 120 ships paid off between Oct. 1801 , and March 1803 , amounts to 918,000l , Therefore the proportion of repair , performed by earl St. Vincent to the whole amount required , was as 118,000l . is to 918,000l. , or nearly 1 to 8 , and this in 2 years and 8 months . His lordship at this rate ( which can not be denied to be a fair statement ) would have been 20 years completing the
