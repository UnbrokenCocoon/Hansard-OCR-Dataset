, by which treaty it was stipulated that the said nabob vizier , for the aid and assistance of the English troops when stationed with him , should pay monthly for the charges of a brigade from the time that the said troops should enter his territories , at his request , until their return , the sum of two lacks 60,000 sicca rupees ( or 32,500l . ) ; and , as the subsidy above stipulated for related particularly to the defence of possessions in the vicinity of the British territories , it was further stipulated , in a subsequent article , that , `` if the aforesaid nabob Vizier shall ever require the aid or assistance of the English Company for the defence of any other of his countries , 370 he will fix something for the company in proportion to the service : and in conclusion this solemn declaration was made : `` The English company , and all the English sirdars ( or chiefs ) engage to perform whatever articles are now mutually settled ; and in the future , during the life of the nabob vizier Asoph ul Dowlah , they will not , in any respect or manner , make requests of any thing new , contrary to the tenour of this treaty ; and this the parties mutually swear according to their respective faiths . '' That in the year 1781 Warren Hastings , esq. , being still the governor-general as aforesaid , another treaty between the English company and the nabob vizier Asoph ul Dowlah , was made at Chunar : that , previous to the making of this treaty , the subsidiary force having been found unequal to the purposes of external defence and internal tranquillity , other troops have been from time to time introduced under the denomination of Sibbendies , temporary brigade , & c. & c. so that the expences of the military department became a burthen too great for the finances of the country to support ; wherefore , by the treaty herein last named , it was declared and agreed , that , the said nabob vizier `` having repeatedly and urgently represented that he is unable to support the expences of the temporary brigade , cavalry , and English officers , with their battalions , as well as other gentlemen , who are now Paid by him , under the denomination of Sebundy , & c. & c , ; and having made sundry requests to that and other purposes , and as the constancy and firmness of his alliance with the company entitle him to every consideration and relief that may depend upon us ; I Warren Hastings , governor-general , have agreed that the temporary brigade , and 3 regiments of cavalry , be no longer charged to the nabob 's account for the year fussellee 1189 , excepting a term for 2Â½ months , which is required for their passing the nabob 's boundaries ; and for which , together with all former allowances and arrears , their usual pay and allowances are to be made good ; also , that the English officers , with their sebundy battalions , and other gentlemen , excepting the resident 's office , now upon the nabob 's list , be no longer at his charge for the year 1189 , the arrears being paid up , with the addition of two months allowances ; the true meaning of this being , that no more troops be 371 paid for by the nabob , than the number of European artillery and sepoys agreed for under the title of one brigade , with the late nabob Sujah ul Dowlah , now paid for at the rate of 260,000 rupees ( or 32,500l . ) per month ; to which is now to be added one regiment of sepoys of the present establishment , expressly allowed for the purpose of protecting the office , treasury , and person of the resident at Lucknow ; the pay and allowances of which shall commence from the first of Aughun next , at the rate of 25,000 rupees per month
