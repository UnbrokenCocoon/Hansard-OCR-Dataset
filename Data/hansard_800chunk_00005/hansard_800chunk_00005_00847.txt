About half past three , Mr. Quarme , the deputy usher of the black rod , entered , and summoned the house to the house of peers , to hear the royal commission read for passing bills , and proroguing the parliament . The Speaker , with the whole of the members present , went up accordingly to the house of lords , and on his return , calling the members round the table , read to them a copy of the King 's Speech ; after which the members separated.—Thus ended the fourth session of the second parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland .
