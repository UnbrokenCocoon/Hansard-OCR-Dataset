and to show them that there was a redress , and at any rate a hearing , to be had in the House of Commons , if the Prince should be advised to turn away his ears from their just complaints . This was necessary because it was the duty of representatives , but it was still more imperative , because it might preserve the tranquillity of the country , at a moment when the executive government was madly driving the people to despair , and seeking to convert their complaints into insurrection.â€”If any man then was desirous of preserving peace with America , he would vote for the inquiry ; and every one who gave such a vote might go to his home , and lie down with the consciousness that he had done his utmost to avert the greatest evil with which the people of England could be menaced . , in consequence of the extraordinary facts which had come out in the course of the discussion last night , thought it his duty to inquire into the cause of the difficulty of obtaining access by petition to his royal highness the Prince Regent ? The right hon . the Secretary of State for the Home Department was not in his place , but probably his right hon . friend would be enabled to inform him whether the Secretary of State had represented to the Regent that there were petitions ready to be presented to him , and in that case why his Royal Highness had not been advised to receive them ? replied , that in the absence of his right hon . friend all he could state was , that he believed the ordinary course of presenting petitions was on levee days , and that as yet no levee had been appointed .

It was rather a fearful circumstance , and one which by no means ought to be treated in the light way in which the Tight hon . gentleman seemed disposed to treat it , after the subject had been so long excluded from the constitu- 1166 tional approach to the throne , that , at the commencement of a new sera , the avenues to that throne should yet remain barred . denied that he had any disposition to be facetious on the subject ; nor was he at all aware that be had been so . All that he had said was , that it was really extraordinary to inquire of him what course of proceeding had been adopted by another officer of the State . As far as he was aware of that course , he had communicated it to the hon . gentleman . The hon . gentleman was correct in saying that it was the duty of his right hon . friend , as a member of parliament , to
