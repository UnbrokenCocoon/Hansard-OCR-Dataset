the assumed prerogative of calling upon the people to perform military duty under that system of discipline which is now in practice , we see every man in England , when commanded to take up arms in what is termed the defence of his country , liable to experience the degradation and torture of the lash . `` That a people , formerly so proud of their liberties , would be silent under such an accumulation of oppression , and that the communication of indignant feeling would not , in the end , produce resistance , was too much for even an insolent and obdurate oligarchy to expect . Therefore , the Press , never the last to suffer when freedom is assailed , has become , in proportion to the augmentation of these oppressions , more and more an object of jealousy and of vengeance . And , after having beheld the use that bas been made of the unconstitutional assumption of power by the Attorney General to file Ex Officio Informations , to accuse , to arraign , to amerce , to hold to bail , to ruin , or to pardon , whomsoever he pleases ; after having seen that this accuser , an officer of the crown removable at its pleasure , has also the power 30 of demanding a jury , not taken out of an impartial pannel , but selected by another officer of the crown ; after having seen a judge so eager to convict as openly to anticipate guilt before hearing the evidence in defence ; after having seen the sentences in cases of political libel gradually become more and more severe , till they have far surpassed in severity those for the greater part of felonies , including long imprisonment , heavy fines , banishment to distant jails , and confinement in solitary cells , going to the almost certain ruin and the probable death of the persecuted parties ; after having seen all this , and taken a view of the number of persons thus suffering at this moment we can not , we confess , see much room for repeating the congratulation of our forefathers upon the abolition of the cruel and accursed Court of Star Chamber , which did , without a Jury , that which is now done by means of a Jury chosen by an officer of the Crown ; an alteration which only serves to screen a corrupt political Judge from his due share of public odium , and to deprive the victim of that public compassion , which is always called forth in behalf of those who suffer , from undisguised tyranny . `` To particularise the fatal effects of this course of misrule would , if it were possible , be useless , they being too visible in the multiplied embarrassments and abject state of the country , whether in its affairs at home or abroad . But , to the great cause of all these evils we can not , without a shameful neglect of our duty , refrain from beseeching the attention of your Royal Highness , who will , at once , perceive that we allude to the want of a real representation of the people in the Commons ' House of Parliament . With a fair representation , the people are never in danger ; because , from whatever quarter they feel grievance approaching , here is their court of appeal , here their means of immediate redress . Without such a representation , the people are never safe ; they have no court of appeal , no friend in government , no means of redress or of protection . `` To the want of such a Representation , to the want of a House of Commons emanating from the peoples ' choice and speaking their sentiments , we owe the eighteen years of war against France , lest example should produce a reform of corruption and abuses at home . `` To the want of such a Representation we owe the hundreds of millions of debt , which have debased our currency , 31 sapped the foundations of
