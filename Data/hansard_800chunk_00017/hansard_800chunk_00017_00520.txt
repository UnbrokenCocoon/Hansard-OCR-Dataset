that charge being transferred to the army estimates , which had been formerly included in the grant for foreign corps , and from an increase in the foreign staff . This increase was principally on the foreign staff in the peninsula . The additional charge was incurred in consequence of the promotion of the general officers , and through an augmentation of the number of medical men on the staff . The utility of this arrangement was sufficiently obvious from the improved state of the army in point of health . The staff in our colonies was included in this statement , and in the Mauritius , which was entirely new to the estimate—Under the head of full-pay of retired officers , there was a diminution of 563l . in consequence of the death of certain officers . Under the head of half-pay and allowances , there was a diminution of 3,481l . In the estimate for the in-pensioners of Chelsea and Kilmainham , compared with the estimate of last year , there was a diminution of 640l . This , however , was not a saving nor a diminution to be reckoned on as permanent . In those establishments the pensioners were only cloathed once in two years ; and this being the alternate year in which they were not to receive 897 clothing , the diminution was at once accounted for , while the sum was to be expected again in the estimate of next year . The estimate for the out-pensioners of Chelsea and Kilmainham , exceeded that of the last year by 47,705l . The principal increase in this head arose from the increase of the number of pensioners . The pay-master general , it would be remembered , had two or three years back recovered 200,000l . from certain prize agents . Of this sum 100,000l . in 1810 , had been applied to the public service , and the further sum of 25,000l . in the last year . The remaining balance it was thought proper to keep for the service of the establishment . From this it would be seen that 25,000l . of the sum named was not actually an increase . On the Widows ' Pensions there was an increase of 855l . which arose from the increase of their numbers . For the Volunteer Corps , there was a diminution of 34,850l . In the Foreign Corps , there was an increase of men to the full amount of 5,503 , and the charge consequent on this increase was 180,000l . These were so effective , that one corps consisting of 2,000 men exceeded its establishment by 30 or 40 , and out of their whole number in our service , amounting to 27,000 men , there were not more than 1,500 non-effective.—In the estimate for the Royal Military College there was a reduction of 7,517l . This did not arise from any charges of the establishment , but was caused by the balance of a former vote remaining in hand , applicable to the service of the current year . In point of fact , there was an increase of 1,200l . ; but this , set against the total amount of the balance in hand , made a diminution in the estimate , as he had stated before , of 7,517l . For the building of Sandhurst College , the sum , in the estimate , was 100,000l . The original estimate was 175,000l . Of this sum 40,000l . had been voted in 1810 , 30,000l . in 1811 ; if , therefore ( as the building was expected to be completed in the course of the present year , ) they resolved on voting the sum necessary for its completion , they could not grant less than 100,000l . In the charges for the support of the Royal Military Asylum , there was an increase of 1,364l . and on the Compassionate Fund an increase of 1,913l . On the Irish Barrack department there was a diminution of 49,320l . ; and there was one in the Commissariat department of 16,113l . and under the head
