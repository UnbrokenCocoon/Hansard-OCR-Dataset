the same time , dismiss from our minds all consideration of the little effect with which their valour-has been exerted ; and , in the cause , in which it has been displayed , we lament to see nothing characteristic of that love of freedom , for which this nation has heretofore been so highly renowned in the world . In looking through the history of the last eighteen years of war , we find the valour and resources of our country in no instance employed in the defence or restoration of freedom ; but almost constantly in endeavours to prevent the oppressed from becoming free , or to replunge them into slavery , to re-harden the grasp of despotism , and to sharpen the half-blunted fangs of persecution ; so that , the British flag , formerly the dread of tyranny , appears , through this long and disgraceful period , to have waved only in hostility to the liberties and happiness of mankind . `` From a line of conduct so repugnant to justice , to the common sense and common feeling of men , the natural results have ensued . In those distant regions , where ignorance and feebleness have rendered the people an easy prey to successive usurpations , we have uniformly been conquerors , and , in overturning one despotism , have , for the purposes necessary to the maintenance of corruption at home , uniformly erected another in its stead ; 27 while , in all those countries , where men have attained a knowledge of their rights , and hare possessed courage to avenge themselves on their oppressors , we have found few and treacherous friends , and many and implacable foes . `` The Sovereigns , our Allies , subdued not less by that abuse of their power , which we endeavoured to support , than by the arms of their and our enemy , have either been driven from their thrones , or have abandoned our cause and disclaimed our connection , as the only means of retaining even a scanty portion of their former dominions ; so that , after having stirred up , in hostility to freedom , almost every sovereign of the continent of Europe ; after having expended hundreds of millions in support of that formidable but unprincipled league , we are , at last , reduced to contend alone with the conqueror of that continent , upon a spot , which we have only assisted to desolate and ravage , in defence of sovereigns , who , unable to rely on the affection of their subjects , have sought their personal safety in abdication or in flight . `` To the regret at having seen the national resources exhausted in the prosecution of measures so fraught , at once , with wickedness and folly , we have not , however , to add the shame of having seen the people of this kingdom voluntarily lend their aid to those measures . Their sense of justice and love of freedom revolted at so inhuman a crusade , which , at the outset , they condemned , and against which many had the virtue openly to protest , well knowing , that a war against freedom , in other countries , was , in reality , a war against the people of England themselves . `` To counteract the effect of opinions so obviously just , a system of terror was resorted to ; false alarms were excited ; spies and informers were hired ; plots were invented ; constructive treasons were revived , and new-fangled treasons were en acted ; the safeguards of personal liberty were removed ; fortresses , under the name of barracks , were established throughout The land ; and the fame and the person of every man were placed at the absolute disposal of those , who , calling themselves The servants of the king , were , in fact , the agents of that rapacious and haughty oligarchy , who had long fattened on the mi series of the country , and who in the progress of the principles of liberty ,
