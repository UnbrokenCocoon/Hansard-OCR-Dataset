including non-commissioned officers and drummers , enrolled and serving at the period of their last respective training , specifying the numbers in each county ; also a return of the number of men who will be entitled to their discharge from the Local Militia on or before the 25th of December 1812 , on account of their having completed their four years service , specifying the numbers in each county. '' —Ordered . said , that he had been instructed by his constituents to present to the House a Petition , which he now held in his hand , expressive of their sentiments on the subject of Parliamentary Reform . The anxiety of the freeholders of Caithness to take some opportunity in the course of the present session , to recommend this measure to the attention of the House , arose in some degree from the hardship to which they were at present subjected , in choosing a member alternately with the county of Bute ( a county with which they were nowise connected , either in point of interests or of local situation ) in consequence of which , they would have no representative in the ensuing parliament , to receive their instructions or to attend to their interests . But this was hot the principal , far less the only inducement by which they were actuated in laying this Petition before the Houses They were no less anxious to 377 prove , that at the northern as well as the southern extremity of the empire , in Caithness as well as in Cornwall , the necessity of a temperate and effectual Reform in Parliament was felt and acknowledged . When the state of the representation of Scotland should be brought under the consideration of the House , it would appear that the number both of the freeholders and of their representatives was by no means proportioned to the extent , to the importance , or to the population of that country , of which it was impossible to adduce a stronger instance than the case of that county which he had the honour to represent , a county , which , however inferior to many in wealth and in extent , yielded to none in respectability or independence , but which , under the present system , was excluded , during every alternate parliament , from all participation in the national councils . He should refrain on this occasion from making any observations on the general question of Parliamentary Reform , the propriety of which it was unnecessary at present to discuss . He trusted that the task of pointing out to the House , not only the extent of the evil , but the practicability as well as the expediency of a safe and a sufficient remedy , would devolve upon some gentleman as anxious as he was for the success of the cause , and much more capable to do it justice . He should now content himself with moving for leave to bring up the Petition.—The following Petition was then brought up and read : `` Unto the Honourable the House of Commons , the Petition of the Freeholders of the County of Caithness , assembled at Wick upon the 26th day of August 1811 , to elect a representative to the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain . `` Sheweth ; That your Petitioners are deeply impressed with a sense of the responsibility which attaches to them , in exercising their constitutional right of deputing a proper person to aid in the national councils , and in the preservation of the liberties of the subject against encroachment ; and feel themselves imperiously called upon to stale to your honourable House their conviction , that great and alarming innovations have been made upon this first and vital part of the British constitution . `` It is the firm persuasion of your Petitioners , that the constitution may be 378 restored to its genuine and original purity , by a recurrence to its first principles ; which , so far from endangering , will manifestly tend to ensure its stability ; and they trust that your honourable
