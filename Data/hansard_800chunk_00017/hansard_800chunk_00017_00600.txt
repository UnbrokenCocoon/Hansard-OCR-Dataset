lords , on the other side , of beneficial effects produced by these Orders , he should have delayed his motion until petitions ( as they undoubtedly would ) had flowed in from all the manufacturing districts of the country , proving in the strongest terms the injurious consequences of those Orders . He , however , did not wish to wait for these petitions , but rather to call their lordships ' attention to the subject now , in the hope that they would see the necessity of most seriously considering the state of our commerce and manufactures under the operation of those Orders , while yet they could proceed with deliberate dignity , and ere the subject was forced on their attention in a way less congenial to their wishes , by the loud complaints and addresses of the unfortunate victims of such a system of measures . It was , perhaps , a vain hope , that any thing he could say would have the effect of inducing an abandonment of that pernicious system of policy involved in the operation of the Orders in Council . Yet he trusted their lordships would not refuse to take into consideration a subject 1042 involving so many points of the utmost importance to the country . Previous to entering upon the discussion , it would be of importance to state what the Orders in Council were , to which he referred , and first it would be worth while to observe , that with respect to the blockade in May , 1806 ( from the Elbe to Brest ) , it was intended to be a real blockade , and a force was ordered for that purpose , but that was now at an end , being merged in the Orders in Council . With respect also to the Order in Council , in January , 1807 , prohibiting the trade from enemy 's port to enemy 's port , the object of it was now at an end , in consequence of the annexation of Hamburgh and Holland to France . The Orders in Council , therefore , to which it was his object to call the attention of their lordships , were those issued in November , 1807 , prohibiting the trade to France , and the countries dependent upon her , at the same time , insisting on American vessels coming first to our ports , and paying a tax there ; and also the order of April , 1809 , partly revoking the former Orders , by opening the trade with the north of Europe . It was his intention to consider these Orders , first with respect to their operation on the enemy , whose power and resources they were intended materially to injure , if not altogether to crush and destroy ; secondly , their operation on the neutral , whose rights and advantages they were not designed directly to interfere with ; thirdly , their effect on the commerce and internal resources of the country which they were intended to foster ; and fourthly , their effect on the maritime policy of the country , which ministers had loudly proclaimed their resolution to adhere to with even more strictness than at any former period . With respect to the term maritime policy , he would first observe , that if he conceded the maritime rights as maritime rights , that it never had been , nor could be considered good policy to insist on the extreme of maritime right . On the contrary it had ever been held the soundest policy to relax those maritime rights upon occasions , and under circumstances , where the interests of the country called for it . Upon the effect of these Orders upon the enemy and the neutral it would not be necessary for him to say much . On the first branch he should touch but shortly , because he conceived it to be incumbent on those who had recommended the measure , and boasted of 1043 its efficacy in this respect , to shew that it had really made a strong impression on the
