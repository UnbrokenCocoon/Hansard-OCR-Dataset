borne a distinguished part.—In the annals of our military history , the , plains of Maida can never be forgotten ; where British valour and the steadiness of British discipline routed the veteran troops of France , and humbled the pride of a presumptuous enemy ; and we can not forget , that in the history of that day , your name stands inrolled amongst those whose gallantry bore the brunt of the contest , and decided its issue . Pursuing the same career of honour , and toiling onwards in the fields of war , you have again claimed our admiration and gratitude by your distinguished exertions in the hard-fought battle of Albuera : for the commander in chief of the allied armies upon that day has given us his recorded testimony , that , by your experienced eye , and judicious valour , the triumph of the day was completed ; when you were seen leading on your troops to the charge , and although yourself amongst the wounded , yet fore-most amongst the victorious.—These deeds of glory lose not their reward with a great and warlike nation . I therefore do now , in the name , and by the command , of the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , deliver to you their unanimous Thanks for your distinguished exertions in the glorious battle of Albuera . '' Upon which Major General Cole said , `` Sir ; to be considered by this House as deserving their Thanks , is certainly highly gratifying to my feelings ; but I should ill deserve the honour conferred on me , or the situation I hold , were I to take that merit to myself , which is unquestionably due to the unconquerable spirit and gallantry of the troops it was my good fortune to command on that memorable day .

'' rose and spoke as follows : ; in rising to propose to the House to go into a Committee on the actual State of Ireland , I am sensible that some apology is due from me , for attempting to bring before their consideration a subject of such magnitude and importance . It is , I believe ; within the knowledge of many members of the House , that a notice was given of a similar motion in the name of a noble relation of mine , now unfortunately prevented from attending his parliamentary duty : —however anxious he might feel to discharge that duty ( and no one , I am confident , is more sensible of the importance of the subject , ) yet the House must be aware that occasions may occur , in which the strongest sense of parliamentary duty may be allowed to yield to the severe and melancholy pressure of domestic calamity . The task therefore that he has been obliged to relinquish , I have ventured to undertake . I have a consolation in thinking that the actual State of Ireland will not require any minute and detailed description ; it is written in characters too plain , distinct , and intelligible to be mistaken by the most careless , or misinterpreted by the most perverse : it needs not the aid of rhetoric , nor the embellishments of oratory ; it comes home to the feelings and understandings of all men . With regard to the motion that I shall have the honour of submitting to the House , though it comprehends the whole actual State of Ireland , I certainly wish to confine my view of it principally to the consideration of those disabilities of which the Catholics have long complained , and under which they still continue to labour . I should wish , as
