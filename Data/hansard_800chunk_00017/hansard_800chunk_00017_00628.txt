Since , therefore , the change that the Irish people , and he along with them , had anticipated , had not taken place , he did not conceive himself justified in withholding the Petition any longer . The House had already heard from the intolerant minister , that should a favour able disposition towards the Catholic cause arise in the Prince Regent 's mind , then he would make his bow and withdraw . The House heard this declaration , the like of which never was addressed , perhaps , in the history of the world , by a bigotted narrow principled minister to an enlightened Prince , or a high-minded generous people The hon . general then recomended to his countrymen not even yet to despair—not yet to cast away their last hope . Of one thing they might be assured , that their political friends would never desert them , as long as they pursued the constitutional course which they had hitherto followed . The wisdom of 1087 the Regent would still , he trusted , be triumphant over bigotry and political folly , and they therefore might in time expect better results . For his part , his feeling was little less than detestation for those odious ministers . He had nothing to fear , nothing to hope for , but the approbation of his oppressed countrymen , and therefore with these feelings and with these hopes , he would leave no stone unturned—he would exert whatever little influence he possessed to accelerate the downfal of these weak and intolerant ministers , and to assist the measures which would give happiness to Ireland , security to England , and perhaps peace to the world . But as long as the present Chancellor of the Exchequer and his diabolical phalanx continued in office , they could not fail to bring on the country the greatest evils—evils which must finally lead , not to the subversion merely , but to the subjugation of the country .

When the general Petition should come before the House , he would then further declare his sentiments . The Petition was then brought up and read ; setting forth , `` That the Petitioners have frequently though ineffectually , applied to the House for relief from those penal laws and restrictions which still aggrieve and degrade the Roman Catholics of Ireland ; and that they are fully convinced of the justice of their claims , and determined to persevere stedfastly in asserting them ; and their duty to themselves , to their families , and to their country , impel them once more to solicit the serious and earnest attention of the House to the important subject of their Petitions ; and that the Roman Catholics of these realms are well entitled upon every principle of right and justice , to an equal participation of all the benefits of the constitution , in common with their fellow subjects of every other communion ; they are unconscious of crime , and undeserving of reproach ; their services , industry , properly , numbers , their meritorious and patient demeanour throughout the severest trials , must powerfully recommend their cause to the , favour of an enlightened legislature ; and that the Petitioners solicit then this equal participation ; they desire the abolition of all the restraints upon liberty of conscience , com 1088 plete toleration of the members of all religious persuasions in their respective modes of worship , without the galling restraints of civil disabilities , privations , or exclusions ; they seek permission to adhere to the religious faith of their ancestors and of their country , unmolested by penal laws , which injure and irritate , and shielded against the ignominy , insult , and humiliation which the Roman Catholics of these realms are now compelled to endure ; and that these objects , which the Petitioners thus peaceably pursue , they feel and
