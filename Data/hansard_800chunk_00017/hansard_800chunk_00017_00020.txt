submitting with cheerfuluess in support of that constitution , under which they have experienced the very essence of liberty and freedom . With regard to Ire- 37 land , I can not but congratulate the House on the internal tranquillity of the country , especially as much has been said about some threatened disturbances in the county of Down , and I feel happy in being able to state , that by the zeal of the magistrates , by the interference and advice of a numerous resident gentry , all apprehensions , however slight they might have been , have completely subsided . I feel I have trespassed longer upon the House than I am entitled . There is but one more observation I must beg leave to offer , touching the nature of the Address I am about to propose . It is so framed and constructed , to prevent any objections , that I trust it will meet with the unanimous adoption of the House . Unanimity , at all times , is a most desirable object , but especially in times like these , when we are engaged in a struggle which requires the united efforts of the whole nation to assist—when we are engaged in a contest , not for power , not for ambition , but for our independence as a nation , our existence as a free people . We have an enemy to contend with , whose resources are great , and who would sacrifice every object in the world to attain the destruction of Great Britain . Amongst ourselves , partial bankruptcies and individual inconveniences must be felt—they are the natural consequences of a long , an expensive , and a necessary war ; but 'Justum bellum quibus necessarium , et pia arma quibus , nulla nisi in armis relin-quitur spes .
