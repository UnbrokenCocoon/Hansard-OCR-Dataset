, he did not think it necessary to trouble the House with any more observations at present . , in rising for the first time , disclaimed any idea of emulating the eloquence of the hon . and learned mover ; nor , as to legal argument , would he attempt to follow the hon . and learned gentleman ; but he must say , that it appeared to him , even from his own statement , that the laws and authorities upon which he relied were all of a very ancient date , and antecedent to the Revolution . The practice , as it now existed , had existed for a great number of years : during which time a number of most acute intelligent lawyers , and men extremely jealous of the prerogative of the crown , had satin that House , and never questioned the right of the crown to those Droits of Admiralty ; and indeed the arguments used did not go so much to shew that the system complained of was illegal , as that it was unseasonable . His principal object in rising was to protest against the principle of having a mere stipendiary king , with an income fixed by parliament , and never to be exceeded . He thought that where a certain allowance had been fixed in the commencement of this reign , it would be too much to require that the sovereign should be dependent on the parliament for that gradual but regular increase of his expenditure , which necessarily took place from the great depreciation of money , ( hear , hear ! from the Opposition bench ) or the great increase of prices . Every gentleman who kept a house , must , from his own experience , be sensible of this perpetual increase of prices . He believed the hon . and learned gentleman could shew no instance of a sovereign of this country , who was ever restricted in that manner . He approved of the system existing in the reign of Charles 2d , who had a tonnage duty on all imports and exports . Now , when the great increase of our trade , within the long reign of his Majesty , should be taken into consideration , it appeared highly probable , that if those duties had not been surrendered by the crown at the arrangement , they would have now amounted to such a sum as would have prevented parliament from hearing any complaints of deficiency in the civil list . As to the practice of making grants under the sign manual , it had been of long duration . The hon . gentleman here read an account from the Journals , stating the 262 sums taken in that manner from the Crown Revenues , before they came into the Exchequer , in queen Anne 's reign . As to the possibility of the prerogative of the crown being abused in the manner the hon . and learned gentleman had supposed , and of the minister advising a war merely for the purpose of giving some money to the crown under this claim of Droits of the Admiralty , the supposition appeared to him highly improbable , and the danger theoretical ; but still he did not deny but that it might be proper for parliament to take the whole system into its consideration , whenever there should be a new arrangement of the civil list , on a demise of the crown . As to the business of Copenhagen , which had been mentioned , he believed that nothing had been reserved for the crown under the head of Droits of Admiralty ; and what arose from the capture of the Spanish frigates had been given to those engaged in the Spanish trade.â€”As to the charge of this fund having been abused to the purposes of secret favour and jobs , he believed that only one case had been cited which bore the least appearance of favour , and that was the case of Sir Home Popham , which had already been pretty fully discussed in that House . As to
