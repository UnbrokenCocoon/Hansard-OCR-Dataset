not of consequence , and did not materially alter the substance . He thought it right , however , to state , that he did not authorise the publication , and how the letter and the answer found their way into the public prints he knew not . He , however , fully concurred in the sentiments expressed in that answer , conceiving them to be those which it was his duty to concur in declaring . said , the noble lord had his thanks for bringing this important subject before the House , but he wished , for the sake of convenience , that an earlier day could be fixed upon for the discussion . mentioned Thursday the 19th instant , which was agreed to , and the Lords were ordered to be summoned for that day . rose , and after a few prefatory 1253 observations , entered into the origin and nature of the provisions of the law , as it now stood , respecting marriages contracted without the due consent of parents and guardians . He stated , that in consequence of many scandalous abuses prevailing at the period of the existing enactments , the other House of Parliament had directed the Judges to prepare a Bill for the purpose of remedying the evil . It could not now be alleged that the same grounds existed for continuing , as there undoubtedly were originally for making the provision to which his motion would refer . The hon . and learned gentleman then gave a representation of the act , as it affected illegitimate minors and orphans , without guardians legally appointed .

He was ready to agree , that this was a practice which , in certain cases and to a particular extent , was perfectly justifiable . His , complaint was , that there had evidently been an unwise and indefensible excess , and a total negligence in the exercise of the prerogative of the crown in this respect .
