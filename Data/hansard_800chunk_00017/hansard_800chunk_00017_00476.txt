trusted that if such were the case , the suspension would not be merely for a year , but for 20 , 30 , or even 50 years . If such should not be the object of the Bill , he gave notice that he should propose to extend the suspension for a considerable period , in order that they might not be called upon to consider it from year to year , merely as a temporary measure . If such a Bill did not come before their lordships within a reasonable time , he gave notice that it was his intention to propose a measure of that description . , seeing a noble lord at the head of 826 the foreign department , in his place , wished to ask of that noble lord , whether in the present state of the negociation with the United States of America , it would be improper to lay before the House such Papers , or at least that part of the correspondence which it was notorious had already met the public eye ? He did not wish to make a motion for the correspondence in a negociation , unless it was the opinion of those who had the management of that negociation , that it would not be improper to communicate the correspondence , and he therefore wished to ascertain this fact , in order that he might give a short notice of a motion for such parts as it might not be deemed improper to communicate . said he had not received the commands of his royal highness the Prince Regent , to lay any of the Papers alluded to by the noble lord before the House .

Every body felt the danger of a numerous body of men leagued together in active opposition to the laws of the country , and who had hitherto defeated both the civil and the military power . This danger was the more alarming from the connection between the county of Nottingham and other manufacturing districts of the country . But however strongly he , in common with others , felt this danger , he could not concur in the present Bill , without violating a most important principle in penal legislatureâ€”a principle which he had already had the good fortune more than once to join with a majority of
