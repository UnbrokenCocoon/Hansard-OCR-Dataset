but such was not his intention , for the Letter from Mr. Walsh , which he had moved for , and which had been printed , ( see p. 940 ) , was not of the nature of a private document , it had been publicly read in court , and therefore he might be fairly justified in assuming that he did not intrench upon any private rights . He agreed with those who thought that judicial power should be assumed by the House of Commons as seldom as possible , nor was the present the first opportunity that had been afforded him of expressing the opinion , how little suited were its functions for such a purpose . Much less would he wish that questions of individual property , or of general character should be there discussed , since it ill suited the dignity of the House , that through it , means should be afforded to private ma- 1176 levolence to scrutinize every deviation from the strictest rules of moral rectitude ; but it was inherent in the House of Commons , and was a part of the constitution of every aggregate body , to preserve its character and reputation . If the House was proud of the splendid talents of some of its members , —if it felt gratified by the exertions of military prowess by others—or if it owned with satisfaction the dignity it derived from the not less important , though less glaring virtues of integrity and rectitude in others , it was impossible for it not to suffer in an equal proportion , if men whose characters were stained by vice and corruption were still permitted to retain seats in a body , where their peculiar deformity was rendered the more conspicuous by the general excellence of the whole . Unless from time to time wholesome remedies were applied to purify it , it was impossible that this main limb of the constitution could continue healthy and vigorous . It was scarcely necessary for him to deduce instances from ancient history , where this power had been exercised : the extensive and uncontrouled authority exercised by the censors over the Roman senate was well known , not only on important occasions , but sometimes with capricious indiscretion . They long endeavoured to check the progress of the swelling tide of luxury and corruption , and long succeeded ; at length they were overpowered by the weight of the torrent ; the censorian power was overwhelmed , and when again it rose and endeavoured to re-establish its footing , the efforts were feeble , and the attempt was vain ; the flood of luxury and vice expanded itself over the whole empire , and at last extinguished the few remaining sparks of virtue and patriotism which had once blazed forth so conspicuously a glorious example to surrounding nations ; The British House of Commons , however , had prudently never permitted this censorian power to be exercised by any other hands than its own , and many examples of its exercise must be present to the minds of those acquainted with its history , which had been re-printed together in the year 1807 . Cases of all kinds might here be discovered , but no general , positive , or precise rules appear to have been laid down ; but the House exercised its discretion according to the facts of the particular case presented to its consideration . There were , expulsions for libels on persons in and out of the House , where the 1177 legal acceptation of the word had never been contemplated , and for gross immorality and impiety in denying the principles of the Christian religion , had been deemed , in the beginning of the last century , a sufficient reason for thus severely expressing the indignation of the House . He did not mean to enter into the merits of these cases ; he only cited them to shew that the Commons had always considered themselves masters of their own proceedings regarding their own members . The expulsion of colonel Caw-thorn , in 1796 , was entirely a new
