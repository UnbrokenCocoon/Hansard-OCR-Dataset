his pecuniary accounts , or that the government had been over ready in reimbursing the money he had expended , or in sanctioning the expence incurred . The last head of expenditure to which he wished to call the attention of the House , was the compensation for his losses . The sum was 7,765l . 11s . and the sum for his secretary and servants 794l . 11s . 11d . making together 8,560l . 2s . 11d . On the subject of compensation for losses , when he stated that the whole value of the effects he had at Constantinople , amounted to 21,000l . it might be said , that his establishment was too large ; but it appeared from the statement he had read from M. de Italinski , that it was not only not a very expensive one , but that it was less than it ought to have been . He had expected to remain at Constantinople along time , and therefore had taken the whole of his effects with him ; he would if the House chose read the detail . ( A cry of No , no . ) Mr. Arbuthnot then read a letter which he wrote to Mr. Canning , dated 6th November , 1807 , stating , that the amount of the effects which he left at Constantinople amounted to 21,496l . It was impossible for him at the time he wrote to Mr. Canning to calculate precisely the amount of his actual loss , but he was then confident that 7,700l . was as small a sum as ought to be applied for . He had learnt that the palace had been pillaged and his property plundered after he had left Constantinople , and the nature and extent of his loss bad been in part made known to him ; but he might in justice to himself , observe , that in laying before government a detailed statement of the value of his effects , he had taken no notice whatever of that part of his property for which he had not the means of producing vouchers . After he had ascertained that all his property had been lost , except his plate , some of his books , and china , he made an application to government to be further reimbursed , but he had previously applied to his honourable friend opposite to him ( Mr. Adair ) , who knew what losses he bad sustained , and who had declared to him , both verbally and in writing , that he was fully warranted 729 in making the application . In consequence of this application , he was allowed the additional sum of 3,000l. , which further and final compensation had been paid since the making up of the accounts now upon the table . Before he made this application he laid the accounts in all their details before his honourable friend , and it was not till he got his assurance that the property was lest , and that he believed the account a just one , that he made his application for reimbursement .

It would be painful to him if he thought he had been compensated for any losses which might have been avoided ( hear , hear ! ) . When the circumstances of his departure from Constanstinople were mentioned in that House , he had not the honour of a seat
