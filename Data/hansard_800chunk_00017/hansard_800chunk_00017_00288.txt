far as I am personally concerned , to abstain from entering into a discussion respecting the legality or illegality of the late proceedings of the Irish government , and the construction that in their discretion they have put on the Convention act . Not that I conceive that it is not within the competence of parliament to institute such an enquiry , but I should be reluctant in the course and train of judicial proceedings , to propose the adoption of any specific proposition , which might be supposed in any degree to affect or impair the ends of substantial justice . But with regard to the policy which dictated these measures , with regard to the policy which 495 dictates the continuance and extension of these proceedings , combined with the system of unqualified and undeviating opposition to the claims of the Catholics so uniformly maintained by the present ministers , I am justified in asserting that an increased degree of dissatisfaction and discontent , an increased feeling of disquiet and irritation , has been produced throughout the whole of the Catholic community ; and it does not appear to be confined to the Catholics alone : in many parts of Ireland the Protestants hare come forward in support and vindication of their Catholic brethren . There can hardly indeed be a stronger proof of the urgency of the crisis , than that those whose interests have been represented as so adverse to those of the Catholics , should now find their interests and their security most promoted by advancing and supporting the claims of their fellow countrymen . Reflections of this nature , and a consideration of the state of discontent and dissatisfaction so widely and unequivocally felt by the whole body of Catholics , would naturally lead to the propriety of examining into the grievances complained of , and the duty indeed , consistently with the security of the country , of satisfactorily redressing them . It is sufficient in this part of the subject to recall the attention of the House to the various discussions that have taken place upon former occasions , without en deavouring to repeat the arguments by which they were supported . It is not necessary to travel back to the council of Constance , or to the decrees promulgated in the fourth of Lateran . It is hardly necessary to go into a review of the earlier periods of English connection with Ireland , of the policy pursued by king William , nor even to dwell at any length upon the history of the two acts that were passed at the beginning of the last century , so emphatically called the two ferocious acts of queen Anne , which , however apparently justified by the necessity of the times , and the circumstance of a Catholic party being in league with a foreign Pretender , did nevertheless impose the badge of servitude and submission upon a prostrate and degraded population . Much indeed has been done since that period to ameliorate the condition of the Catholics , and I am not disposed to under-rate the value of that amelioration . Those obnoxious statutes have been repealed , and the consequence has been , 496 that Ireland has sprung forward with the vigour and elasticity of youth ; but disabilities , though modified in extent , yet not contemptible in degree , still continue . The principle of exclusion is stilt maintained : that principle , which , when founded solely on differences in points of doctrine and in modes of faith , and no longer applied as a test to discriminate and detect opinions politically dangerous , can only be considered by dispassionate persons as affixing upon the whole body of the Catholics an unnecessary penalty , conveying an unmerited reproach , and wantonly inflicting a gratuitous disgrace . The amount and nature of the several disabilities is sufficiently known to the House . It is indeed contended in limine , that the removal of these disqualifications would not materially interest or affect the great mass of Catholic population . It is contended , that the private soldier would feel no
