however , let the noble baron 's remarks pass without saying , that he was fully prepared , whenever the day should come , to defend his conduct , and that of his colleagues , as well as the conduct of a noble duke in Ireland , and that of his colleagues also . But he would repeat , that he should reserve his arguments for a day , when the subject should come before the House , unmixed with any other extraneous matter . As to the Address itself , his lordship conceived , that it contained nothing which could prevent any member of the House to concur in assuring his royal highness the Prince Regent , that they were ready to lend him all the assistance in their power , in the discharge of the arduous duties which had devolved upon him . said , that he fully concurred in the propriety of avoiding any lengthened discussion upon the various important topics which were suggested by hearing the Speech which had been read from the woolsack . He entirely approved of the policy pursued by his noble friend in confining himself , on the present occasion , to the delivering of his protest against any expression of his opinions being understood upon points in which it was impos- 12 sible for him to concur : thinking also , that most of the topics were of such importance , as to require a separate and particular discussion . Concurring generally in the address which was proposed , he could not refrain from joining his noble friend : he should feel unhappy if he departed from that House without declaring , that he retained all the opinions he had before held , on subjects of great magnitude ; opinions confirmed by experience and the evidence of facts , —opinions which he should be ready to maintain and defend , on future opportunities of discussing them . Whether the noble secretary of state chose to allude to the state of affairs with America , on which he had shewn much caution , and even silence , and ventured to call our transactions in that quarter , a verification of the assertion that the system of the government had contributed to the security , prosperity , and honour of the country ; or whether he intended to refer to the system of our measures in the peninsula , he pledged himself that he should be ready to meet him , and to contend , that whatever might be said to have been done , bad not been done to the promotion of the safety and honour of the country ; and that the general system adopted had been , in fact , the source of almost all oar present and impending calamities . On the important concerns of the state of Ireland , he must deeply regret , that , from the manner of mentioning it by the noble lord , he could derive no hope that ministers had seen the impolicy of their conduct ; or that they would adopt—he would not say , merely wise and liberal measures , but some measures more consistent with justice , and with the common rights of mankind . No hope could he derive of any useful measure on that subject , so essential to the safety of the country ; but , on the contrary , ministers seemed determined to persevere in what they considered to be the wisdom and expediency of adhering to their system for the future . He thought the House bound immediately to take into their consideration the treatment of the people of Ireland , not only with a view to what had already passed , but with a prospective view , for the adoption of such timely and just measures as might avert the ruin of the country . Government , however , he must repeat , appeared , for any thing be had heard to the contrary , to be resolved on pursuing a system which would risk the destruction of the public safety . He 13 was happy to learn that a proposition on this subject
