he had espoused ; but even those facts which he had stated , he presumed to think , were sufficient to ground him in moving for the inquiry which he was now about to propose . At the time of the Reformation it was allowed that something ought to be done on this subject , and bishop Cranmer wrote a book to that effect Nothing however had since that time been 303 done , and he hoped the House would now make a beginning by agreeing to his present motion . The noble lord concluded with moving , `` That a Committee be appointed to enquire into the state of the jurisdiction of the inferior Ecclesiastical Courts , and to consider whether any reformation is necessary to be made therein , and to report their opinion to the House . '' observed , that the statement of his noble friend pointed out many radical objections to the state of the law , but not to the administration of it as practised in the court , over which a learned judge , whom he had now in his view , presided . He agreed that it would be desirable that the law should not continue as it was , in many of the respects alluded to by his noble friend . But still , such was the law , and an inquiry into the proceedings of inferior ecclesiastical courts would not have the effect of doing away the evil . The evils complained of in a great measure arose from the jealousy of the courts of common law , in regard to the proceedings of the ecclesiastical courts , which compelled them to have recourse to a circuitous mode of giving effect to their decisions . If the ecclesiastical courts had proper authority to enforce their decisions , the expences would be small , and the effects of their sentences would be infinitely less burdensome than they were now felt to be . By the act of the 5th Elizabeth , the writ 'de excommunicato capiendo ' was first returnable to the court of King 's Bench : this caused an additional expence . The fact was then certified to the ecclesiastical court , and then a writ for the delivery of the party arrested into the hands of the ecclesiastical tribunal was issued . Thus the anxiety which the courts of common law felt for the liberty of the subject , as far as the ecclesiastical courts were concerned , enhanced the matter of costs , and produced an evil very inadequate to the original offence . It appeared to him to be desirable that this law , as it now stood , should be reviewed , and also that no person should have any sort of ecclesiastical authority committed to him , who was not fully conversant in ecclesiastical matters . The appointment of a Committee , however , could not give relief in any one of the points to which his noble friend had alluded.â€”There was one subject to which his noble friend had referred which he confessed seemed to him to be of very great importance ; namely , that persons were appointed to exercise ecclesias- 304 tical authority in inferior jurisdictions , without possessing the requisite qualifications . The statute required that no Chancellors or other officers of inferior jurisdiction should be appointed , unless they were persons skilled in the civil law , and also in the practice of it . This enactment , however , was not only eluded , but it was expressly disobeyed . He had in his eye an hon . and learned friend of his , who filled the principal judicial situation in our supreme ecclesiastical court ( sir William Scott ) ; and he could only say , that if all the ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the kingdom were equally attended to , we should hear of no complaints such as those now stated to the House by the noble lord . The clause in the statute provided , That no person should be qualified for any ecclesiastical office of a judicial nature , unless he were 26 years of
