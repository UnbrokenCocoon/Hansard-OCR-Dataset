age , skilled in the civil and canon laws , and practised in them . This act passed in the year 1603 . In the year 1616 , a petition was presented to the Archbishop , complaining of the appointment of a son of the then bishop of Landaff to one of those inferior jurisdictions , without his being duly qualified according to law ; and on this representation the person objected to was removed . In the year 1625 , a similar representation was made as to the son of the bishop of Hereford , who was removed in like manner . An application was some time afterwards made at common law , to remove a person of the name of Sutton , which was refused . But in the reign of king William , on an application made to remove a person of the name of Jones , from one of the inferior ecclesiastical jurisdictions , on the ground of his not being duly qualified , he was accordingly removed . It was obvious , therefore , that the law was at one time strictly acted up to and enforced , and that it was not deemed enough that persons appointed should have practised , but that they should also be skilled in the civil and canon law . It had now , however , become too much the practice for those who had the patent right to such appointments to imagine that they were entitled to appoint their own sons or other relations , without at all regarding their qualifications . This was a matter of great importance , and deserving of being strictly looked into ; for , whatever the law was , if it was not duly administered , it was of little moment . A Committee , he was of opinion , could not tend to remedy this evil . said , that he had made some inquiry into this business , and understood the surrogates had minutely investigated the conduct of the cause , and had declared that all the proceedings were regular ; and that as to the prisoner being a minor , from the contumacy shewn by not appearing to the citation , it was impossible the court could know any thing of it . If she had appeared : and pleaded her minority , the court could then have determined on it ; but as the matter stood , they knew nothing about it . said , he could hardly believe , that the noble lord who had brought forward the present question , was himself aware of the nature and effect of the motion he had submitted to the House . He trusted , however , that the House would pause before it agreed to go into an inquiry such as that proposed by the noble lord . Let the House consider what might be the consequences to others of their agreeing to such an inquiry ; let them consider the number of persons who must be brought up from different parts of the country to be examined before the Committee , at an expence which their petty emoluments would but ill enable them to discharge ; and he was satisfied they would require farther proof of the necessity , and also of the utility of such a Committee before they concurred in the motion of the noble lord for the appointment of it . The House , however , must also feel itself called on in justice to consider that this was a principle which attached to every court , high and low , namely , that every court , however , inferior its jurisdiction might be , was entitled to be held in a decent state of respect , till it was proved to have done something to forfeit its character . When this should be proved , it would be time enough to hold out such jurisdiction to public odium ; but till then he could not agree to any such measure as that proposed by the noble lord.â€”He should not follow the noble lord into those legends of antiquity to which he had had recourse
