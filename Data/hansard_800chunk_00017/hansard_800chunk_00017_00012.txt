that in them did not consist the essential education of a people . These , indeed , were calculated to produce great advantages ; but the real education of a nation was produced and matured by the fairness , justice and mildness of its government . By all the various grievances 25 which he had enumerated , more particularly by extending the military character to all , and by the sufferings and burdens under which we laboured , was this education greatly checked , if not annihilated ; and sympathy and feeling were almost extinguished from the breasts of our oppressed countrymen.â€”On these various topics he should move , That an humble Address be presented to his royal Highness the Prince Regent . He had framed his Address with all respect to the illustrious person to whom it was meant to be presented ; and at the same time embracing every point which his own sense of duty to his constituents , and to the country in general , pointed out to him as essential . The great and important point , he conceived to be , a full and fair representation of the people in that House . To the want of that full and fair representation of the people in Parliament , he , with full confidence that his assertion was correct , attributed the debt of the hundreds of millions sterling with which we were now loaded , and the numerous other calamities which had been daily accumulating on the country .

'' The hon . baronet then moved the following Address : `` We , his Majesty 's most dutiful and loyal subjects , the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , in Parliament assembled , return your Royal 26 Highness the humble thanks of this House , for the most gracious Speech delivered by the Lords Commissioners , by your Royal Highness 's command . `` We assure your Royal Highness that we shall , without delay , take into our serious consideration all the matters to which your Royal Highness has been pleased to direct our attention , and endeavour to adopt such measures as are best calculated to meet the exigencies of the times . `` But we should deem it a failure in our duty , were we on this solemn occasion to omit expressing to your Royal Highness with the frankness suggested by a due sense of our functions , the sentiments we entertain on the present situation of our country , and to point out to your Royal Highness the remedy , which , in our opinion , is called for by the evils already experienced , and by the dangers which appear to be impending . `` We always hear with great satisfaction , though not with surprise , that our countrymen in arms , whether by land or by sea , maintain the character of their ancestors ; but , we can not , at
