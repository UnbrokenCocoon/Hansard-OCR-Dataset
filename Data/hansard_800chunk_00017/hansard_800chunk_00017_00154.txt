When the question before the House was disposed of , the right hon gentleman , if he pleased , could move for it ; otherwise he would do it himself . , in reply , maintained strenuously , that the bargain between the sovereign and the parliament had been abrogated , and that the crown ought not , with safety to the constitution , to retain such immense sums at its disposal . said , it was with extreme reluctance he got up . He perfectly coincided with his right hon . friend ( Mr. Tierney ) . He could not agree that the crown had ever bargained for its rights ; but he was of opinion , that the king of this country could not have a shilling of revenue without being liable to the examination of parliament , the crown had a right to the revenue , but the parliament had a right to enquire into it .
