their records ; by which grant the Petitioners ' predecessors endured the double mortification of witnessing the invasion of their chartered rights , and of seeing those representatives who had betrayed their sacred trust , rewarded with the spoils of those rights which they were bound to protect ; and that , so flagrant was this breach of trust and violation of right esteemed by the lord Middleton , then lord chancellor of Ireland , that he entered his solemn protest against the passing of the said act on the Journals of the House of Lords of Ireland , thereby evidencing the opinion of the first legal character in the kingdom as to the injustice of the said act ; and that even the framers of the said Statute , as if to excuse the violation of the right , while they retained its benefit in the particular instance , introduced a clause in , the said act , empowering the mayor , aldermen , and common council of the city of Cork , in case of the death of the said Edmond Knapp and Edward Hoare , to appoint the weigh-masters of the said city in future , which power of appointment , by the intervention of several subsequent acts , made to continue the act of the 10th of George the 1st , was rendered nugatory , inasmuch as new appointments of weigh-masters , by name , were made in the said acts of continuation , previously to the occurring of any actual vacancy , whereby the Petitioners ' predecessors were tantalized by the abstract recognition of their rights , and the practical prevention of its exercise ; and that the foregoing method of parliamentary appointment was continued through four successive changes of weigh-masters , until an act was passed in the 31st year of his present Majesty , continued by an act of the 40th year of his Majesty , by which the appointment was vested in his Majesty , his heirs , and successors , during the continuance of the said last mentioned act , and no longer , viz . until the 29th day of September , which will be in the , year 1812 , 1172 and to the end of the then next session of parliament , at which period an opportunity will occur of restoring to the Petitioners a right of which they have been deprived in the manner hereinbefore stated , without the slightest insinuation of criminality or misconduct on their part , and which they are chiefly anxious to regain , in order to exercise their right for the public advantage ; for , the Petitioners further shew , that the emoluments of the office of weigh-master of the city of Cork now amount to a very considerable annual sum , arising altogether from the fees paid by the proprietors of the articles weighed , branded , and inspected ; and that , as the office is executed principally by deputy , a large annual tax is thus levied on the industry of individuals , without producing any local or national benefit whatever ; whereas , should it please the House to grant the prayer of this Petition , a fund might be formed , by the application of which great local and no inconsiderable general advantage would arise , it being the Petitioners ' object to vest one third part of the emolument of the said office in trustees , for the deepening the river and improving the harbour of Cork , which work would greatly contribute to the safety and facility of the navigation and commerce not only of that port , but of the United Kingdom in general , inasmuch as nine-tenths of the shipping which trade to the city of Cork are the property of British subjects ; and further , it would be the Petitioners ' object to vest one other third of the said emolument in trustees , for widening and improving the streets of Cork , a work of great local utility , and from the prosecution of which , although commissioners have been long since appointed by act of parliament , the
