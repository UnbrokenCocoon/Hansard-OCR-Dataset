part of his Royal Highness , was entirely spontaneous ; for I never had the presumption to suppose that any humble services I could give to 901 the illustrious personage whom I have the pride and happiness to serve , could entitle me to claim any public remuneration ; and I do readily agree with an hon . gentleman , who , on a former night , with more justice than perhaps kindness , observed , that the situation I possessed in his Royal Highness 's family was perfectly sufficient for any services I could render . Indeed , Sir , I will go further than that hon . gentleman , by declaring my reward to be more than sufficient , and owning that life at this moment seems to promise me but too short a span to ever requite , by any services , the abundant over-payment which the generous and noble heart of my royal master has heaped upon me for sixteen years past , in acts of kindness and affectionâ€”acts which have been of so delicate and peculiar a nature , as to bind my life , heart , and soul , in eternal love and attachment towards him . It seems , Sir , to have erroneously gone abroad , that this office was not a civil , but a military one , from my predecessor having been for many years , and at the time of his death , a general officer ; but I beg to observe , in proof of its being a civil , and not a military office , that if my information be correct , general Fox did enjoy this office before , and when he was a lieutenant of dragoons .

I have now , Sir , only one or two observations more to trespass on the House . I beg leave , Sir , 902 to submit to its feeling , that I have by the acceptance of this office already vacated my seat in parliament , and since undergone the inconvenience and difficulties of a re-election for it ; and although I am quite satisfied that the office of Receiver and Paymaster to the Widows ' Pensions is of a most efficient and important nature in its duties , having nearly 1,600 widows to keep a regular account with , by three several payments in every year , to write in the course of each payment as many letters to them , and to take an equal number of affidavits on those different occasions , and which duties would well require not only the constant attendance of one chief and two or three assistant clerks , besides the proper personal superintendance of the Receiver and Paymaster to the Widows ' Pensions himself ; and also that the item of the poundage is
