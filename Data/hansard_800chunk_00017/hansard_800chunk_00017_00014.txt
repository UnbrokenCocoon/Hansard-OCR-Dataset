saw the seeds of a destruction of their ill-gotten power . 28 `` Under the operation of this system we have beheld much that remained of our liberties wholly swept away ; we have seen practised , under the name of collecting a revenue and in the guise of legal proceedings , acts of oppression and insult , which our forefathers would have perished rather than endure . The dwellings , the books , the most private recesses and concerns of Englishmen , once so sacred , are now exposed to the intrusion and inquisitorial scrutiny of numberless mercenary agents , appointed and removable at the pleasure of the crown . Financial rapacity breaks in between landlord and tenant , and , in violation of every principle of property , makes the crown co-proprietor in every man 's estate , having a prior claim upon his tenant . `` Under the name of redeeming the land tax it makes a general confiscation of landed property ; while , in the form of a stamp duty , it seizes the bequests of the dead in their passage to the living ; so that , at last , there is no man in England who can be said to be the owner or proprietor of any thing , the government having , by degrees , assumed a controul and mastership over property of every description . `` There was a time , in English history , when the extortions of an Empson and a Dudley , though under the sanction of an act of parliament , brought the principals to the block and consigned their subaltern agents to public vengeance in the pillory ; but , now we have many Empsons and Dudleys in every county , who , under `` the name of surchargers , supervisors , & c. inflict amercements and fines at their pleasure , the parties so amerced being denied not only an appeal to a jury , but even the aid of counsel or attorney to speak in their defence before those fiscal tribunals , which , to the terror of the people , are established in every corner of the land . `` In exact proportion to the increase of these extortions have we seen the increase of the military force , and the multiplication of means calculated to divest the soldier of all fellow-feeling with the citizen . Cooped up in Barracks and Depots , flogged for the most trifling offences , the former loses , by degrees , all regard for those rights of which he is deprived , all attachment to that constitution out of the pale of which he is placed , and becomes the passive and unconscious instrument of tyrannical coercion . But , mistrustful of Englishmen ' 29 feelings , many thousands of German and other foreign mercenaries have been introduced and placed on our military , establishment with privileges not possessed by the troops of our own country ; whole districts of England and large portions of the English army have been put under the command of German officers ; and , the more effectually to estrange the people from the native soldiers , the latter have , in many instances , been compelled to assume a German garb . The Militia , heretofore regarded as the sole constitutional force of the country , upon the principle , that , as men had most interest , so they would be most stout , in defending their liberties and properties ; the Militia , having been long perverted from its legitimate purpose , has , at last , by the interchange of the English and Irish Militias , been converted , with respect to the two countries , into the too convenient instrument of reciprocal oppression ; and especially with regard to Ireland , where the just remonstrances and complaints of a generous , a gallant , and long-suffering people have uniformly been met with repulsion and disdain . `` In the institution of the Local Militia we behold all the severities of a military conscription without its impartiality and without a chance of its rewards ; and , in
