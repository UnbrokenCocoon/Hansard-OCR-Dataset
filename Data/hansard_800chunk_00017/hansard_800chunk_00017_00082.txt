. In order to fully explain this , he bad moved for the estimated charges on the Civil List Revenues , a they were laid before the House in 1804 , together with the actual charges of each subsequent year . From these accounts it would be seen that in the year immediately following , namely , in 1805 , the excess beyond the estimate was 120,378l . and in the subsequent years up to the present time , as follows : In 1806 Â£.163,636 1807 138,406 1808 89,238 1809 193,142 1810 143,894 1811 110,010 The average , it would be seen , might be taken at 125 or 124,000l . annually . The Committee were aware how this excess had been met , that it had been paid , not out of the public revenue , but out of the funds arising from the excess of the Scotch Civil List , and the Admiralty Droits . The Committee would feel it improper to apply to the public to pay this excess as long as there were other funds to meet it , but it was necessary in the event of any increase of the excess to give parliament the earliest notice of it . It might have been expected , that when it was found the arrangements made in 1804 were insufficient to meet the charges of the Civil List , that some notice would have been taken of it ; but no formal notice had been taken of it from that time to the present . He would propose that , as long as , by means of unappropriated funds , the annual average excess of 23 or 24,000l . could be met , it should be defrayed by no other , but if it should increase so as to exceed its present average by 10,000l . that should be deemed sufficient to bring the subject 160 before parliament to meet their animadversions , if they should be deserved . He was afraid that his statement would not be clearly understood by many ; but with the indulgence of the Committee , he would offer a few words on one other point . He thought it would be nothing but what must be felt to be perfectly reasonable to make some provision for the expences which had already been incurred by his royal highness the Prince Regent . When his royal highness first assumed the royal functions , with sanguine hopes that his Majesty would soon be restored to his people , he had declined receiving any assistance whatever . It could not , however , be supposed that he could assume the reins of government , in the name of his majesty , without incurring a very considerable ex-pence . To meet this he should therefore propose a grant of the sum of 100,000l . This sum , however , be begged the Committee to understand , was to be voted but for one year ; because , though it might be necessary for the assumption of the royal functions , it might not be required for their permanent exercise . He had now stated all that it was necessary to bring before the Committee . The 100,000l . he had just mentioned , would , he thought , be deemed a very small sum when the object to which it was to be applied was considered . The 70,000l . to be added to the Civil List , was the only permanent charge to be made on the Consolidated Fund ; and he trusted , the Committee would feel that the arrangements necessary to be made for the splendour of the Regent and the comforts of the King could not be accomplished at a less expence . The right hon . gentleman concluded with moving , 1 . `` That for making provision for the due arrangement of his Majesty 's Household and for the exercise of the royal authority during the continuance of his Majesty 's Indisposition , and for the purpose of enabling the Queen to meet the increased expence to which , in consequence of such indisposition , her Majesty may be exposed
