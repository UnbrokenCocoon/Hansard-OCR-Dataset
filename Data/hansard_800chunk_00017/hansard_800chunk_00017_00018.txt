trusting that I may receive from them now , the same forbearance I have more than once before so gratefully experienced , hoping that it will condole with me on that subject , in particular , which the hon . bart . has omitted to mention , namely , the state of his Majesty 's health . The House must most sincerely condole , in common with his Royal Highness and the country , at the calamitous state in which his Majesty still remains ; we must lament it the more , as every day 's experience gives us additional reason to despair of his ultimate recoyery ; but if so bumble an individual as myself dare offer consolation to the wounded feelings to the House , upon so melancholy a subject , it would be by referring them to a grateful remembrance of those virtues—to a grateful recollection of that attachment to the constitution he so eminently possessed , and which the House will agree with me is no less conspicuous in the conduct of his royal representative . I am sure the House will most heartily concur in the anxious wishes of his Royal Highness , by making such arrangements for the care and com-fort of his Majesty 's person , as may be most suitable to his high and exalted rank , so that if it should please Providence to restore him again to the prayers of his people , he may find himself , upon waking from his trance , surrounded , not by the glare of pomp , but by that solemn splendour so due to his royal person , in whatever situation , or under whatever circumstances it may have pleased Providence to place him ; for our anxious solicitude for his comforts is but a debt we largely owe for those years of care and anxiety he has passed in watching over the best interests of his people . The time now draws near , when those Restrictions , which the legislature thought fit to place on the power of the Regent , are about to expire , and however I differ from the right hon . gent . on the restrictive clauses in the Regency Bill , I have some satisfaction in thinking , that they have given the country an opportunity of proving that his royal highness , although placed in the most difficult situation , never for one moment lost sight of the advantages of the country , never had but one object in view , the happiness and the welfare of his people . But , in calling the attention of the House to our affairs in the peninsula , no man , of whatever party he may be , can venture to withhold his praise and admiration at the 35 persevering bravery of our army in Portugal ; neither can any man , at this time of day , deny that praise so justly due to the merits of my illustrious countryman , lord Wellington , who , at the head of that army , has proved to Europe and to the world , that the ambitious views of Buonaparté may be checked , and that the independence of a brave nation is still to be preserved by British example , and by British valour . In turning to the rest of the peninsula , and considering the situation of Spain , we certainly have to lament that her struggles for freedom and independence have not been attended with equal success , as the efforts ' of Portugal ; but it is a sincere satisfaction to think , that her ardour is not damped , as by the accounts received from Catalonia , and other provinces , there is every reason to believe there still exists in the country a most decided hatred , and determined animosity to their French oppressors . But , Sir , it must be so , for the French have kindled a flame in Spain , which they never can extinguish ; they have raised up a spirit against themselves , which they never can subdue ; and whatever may be the opinion
