) was persuaded , that there never had been a fair question of doubt raised on the correctness of the Customhouse accounts , which were by no means justly liable to the observations made on them by the hon . and learned gent . 1117 He would now proceed to an examination of the facts connected with the statement made by the hon . and learned gentleman . The Orders in Council were issued in the year 1807 , and it would be proper to consider , by comparison , what effect they had had on the export trade of the country . In the year he had just mentioned , the exports amounted to 34,566,572l . ; in 1808 , they were 34,554,267 ; in 1809 they had increased to no less than 50,286,900l . ; and , in 1810 , they were 45,869,860l . ; —a great and evident increase from the year 1807 . The hon . and learned gentleman had spoken of 9,000,000l . of British exports having been seized by Buonaparté , in the year 1810 ; and that , for the express purpose of getting possession of this property , he had , for a short time , suspended his own decrees.—That the act alluded to was one of great and unjustifiable violence , no person could doubt ; but how did the fact stand ? The decrees were relaxed from the end of 1807 to 1810 , and for two years previous to the seizure complained of , the trade to the Baltic had been conducted with the utmost advantage , and it only arose from accidental causes of wind and weather , that Buonaparté was enabled to apply the cargoes of several hundred ships to his own use ; but the truth was , that this trade had nothing to do with the Orders in Council , and the destruction of the trade so vehemently enforced was , in truth , an augmentation from twenty-five to thirty millions . A few years since it had been as boldly said , as it had been tonight repeated , that our trade with America would be annihilated ; and he then took occasion modestly to express his opinion , that if a Non-Intercourse law were passed in the United States , the commerce with the Spanish and Portuguese colonies might be carried on directly from Great Britain . Experience had fully confirmed this opinion . In 1807 , our exports to America and the West Indies amounted to 14,800,000l . ; in 1808 , notwithstanding the partial prohibition in the United States , to 15,800,000l . ; in 1809 , to 19,200,000l . ; in which last year , be it remembered , the American Non-Intercourse act was carried into effect ; yet , notwithstanding that , in the year 1810 , the exports to all America and the West Indies , amounted to no less a sum than 20,418,000l . And from this it appeared , that , between the years 1807 and 1810 , an increase to the amount of six millions sterling had taken place in the 1118 export trade of this country to all America Did he mean from thence to argue that England ought to be indifferent to her connection with the United States of America ? By no means : he had always contended , and he always should , that the interests of Great Britain and of America were closely united . But it was too much to expect , that this country should allow America to treat her differently from other states . Reverting to the seizures which the hon . and learned gentleman said had been made by Buonaparte , he begged leave to observe , that , instead of nine millions being thus borne away , not more than six or seven had fallen a sacrifice to his arts . The ships seized by him , were , at the time , trading under the system of neutralization ; and the loss was sustained by an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances ; by a non-adherence to the place of rendezvous which was appointed , and
