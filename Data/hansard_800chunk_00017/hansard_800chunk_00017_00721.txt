entitled to it under Mr. Windham 's Bill . The same explanation would account for the excess under the head `` Military Corps . '' The division of military establishments was augmented 4,666l . the major part of which had been deducted from the contingencies , in consequence of the inspector-general of hospitals having ordered that the supernumeraries should be placed on the regular establishment . The remainder , being a sum of 800l . was occasioned by a new appointment of deputy inspector of hospitals . The remaining divisions were nearly the tame as last year ; the largest difference being only 15l . to the professors of the academy at Woolwich . He was concerned to state that the excess of the `` mount of the ordinary estimates was nearly 88,000l . but , allowing for a diminution for rations of provisions , it would be found to be only about 20,000l.—He would now advert to the Extraordinary Estimates , the excess upon which was 373,460l . This increase arose partly from government having deemed it right to make the island of Malta a depot for stores , which were sent there to the value of 130,000l . In Jersey , 45,000l . had been expended in erecting permanent works previously directed by parliament to be built , and the completion of which would require 30,000l . Under the head of Cinque Ports , the sum of 12,510l . was inserted for Dover only , which was proposed to be voted to make good the contracts of government for materials for erecting works which would have cost `` bout 24,000l . but which the inspector 1236 general had thought not at present necessary . At Chatham 2,000l . had been laid out in labour , and 13,000l . on works which it was requisite should this year be finished , and for which 7,600l . more would be requisite . Woolwich had always formed a considerable item : —31,000l . was charged for gun carriages , stores , and for building and fitting up a saw mill , under gen. Cuppings , the expence of which was about 4,000l . and the annual profit 4,284l . Under the title of `` Defences of the Country , '' several weighty sums were included ; the charge amounted to 87,000l . and the towers and batteries built on the coast , had cost 57,324l . being only a continuation of a principle long ago adopted by the House , and much less than the original estimate . On enquiry , he found that the sum of 30,000l . would be amply sufficient to complete them on all points where they were necessary.—For foreign service , the estimate was 360,000l . ; of this , 170,000l . was for the army in Sicily , and 190,000l . for the army in Portugal . There were 360,000l . for the brass and iron ordnance . In the provision of ammunition for regiments , there was a diminution of 160,000l . and in the unprovided estimates a diminution of 213,000l . In the estimates for Ireland there was a small excess above the estimates of last year , of about 1,800l . In the civil and military superannuations , there was an excess , above the preceding year , of 18,000l . There was , therefore , in the whole of the estimates , a nominal excess of 268,000l . but this was merely nominal , for there had been , in reality , a real saving since last year . In the article of salt-petre alone , there was a saving of 100,000l . in the estimate , as it now stood ; for , during the last three years , the sum of 600,000l . had been voted for that article , being at the rate of 200,000l . per annum . Not that so large a supply was needful , but because it was thought requisite to have it as a store . The present Board of Ordnance , however , did not consider that store as necessary , and therefore take only our annual grant of 100,000l.—In concluding ,
