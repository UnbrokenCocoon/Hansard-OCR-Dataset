, such as would have included a full indemnification to his Majesty 's injured subjects ; and , although it was in the power of government to dispense with that satisfaction , either in whole or in part , and either altogether to sacrifice , or partially to give up , the private rights of the individuals , on such grounds of general policy or expediency , as in their wisdom should appear to be best for the interests of the empire at large ; yet the petitioners humbly submit , that the general good ought not , in justice , to be purchased at their private expence ; but they are entitled to receive , from the empire at large , such indemnification as will place them on a footing of equality with their fellow subjects ; and that , after some delay , a negociation was entered upon at London , on this important subject , and , if his Majesty 's government had thought it expedient to insist on full satisfaction , the petitioners would , of course , have been called open for that purpose , to state , and , in some satisfactory manner , to make out their respective losses ; but , as they were not called upon to do this , it appeared that his Majesty 's government thought it expedient , for the general good , to dispense 285 with the full satisfaction to which they Were entitled , and at once to pot an end to a negociation in its nature productive of irritation between the two nations , by accepting of such a sum of money from the United States as could be obtained from them in an amicable manner ; and that a convention between his Majesty and the United States Was accordingly concluded on the 8th of January 1802 , whereby it was agreed to , and concluded by the respective plenipotentiaries , that , in satisfaction and discharge of the money which the United States might have been liable to pay , in pursuance of the provisions of the sixth article of the treaty of Amity , Commerce and Navigation , the United States engaged to pay , and his Majesty consented to accept , for the use of the persons described in the said sixth article , the sum of 600,000l . payable in the manner therein mentioned ; and that the petitioners presented their protest against being considered as acquiescing in the sum so accepted by his Majesty 's government as a full compensation for their claims , and were thereupon advised that they could not , with propriety , urge any further claim at that moment , nor until the precise amount of their losses , and of the compensation to which they might have been entitled under the said sixth article , should be actually ascertained by the result of the inquiry which was then about to be instituted by government ; and that a board of three commissioners was accordingly established , first in the year 1802 by a provisional authority , with a view to a commission from his Majesty , and afterwards by the act of parliament before-mentioned , which created a special jurisdiction for investigating and finally deciding on the amount of losses sustained by the persons described in the said sixth article of the treaty of 1794 , and for the apportionment or distribution of the money agreed to be paid by the United States according to the decisions to be so given On the merits of the respective claims ; and that , by the said act , after reciting the convention , and that `` it was expedient that commissioners should be appointed for the apportioning , dividing or distributing such sum of money amongst the several persons who should by such commissioners be found entitled to receive compensation out of the same , in proportion to their several and respective claims , so far as the same should by such commissioners be approved or adjudged to be good : it was 286 enacted , that Thomas Macdonald , esq. , Henry Pye Rich ,
