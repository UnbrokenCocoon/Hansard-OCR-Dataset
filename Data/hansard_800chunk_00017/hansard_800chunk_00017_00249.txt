; or had dared to prevent or to embarrass the legitimate right of petition ; to prejudge the merits of any petition ; or to affix the authority of the lord lieutenant to any opinion upon the claims of the Roman Catholics ; then indeed inquiry would have been indispensible ; and if the charge could have been substantiated , their lordships must have addressed the throne , for the removal of a government , so unfit for its high trust . But no impediment had been opposed in Ireland to the right of petitioning the crown or parliament ; no vestige could be traced of a project so arbitrary and desperate , in any act of the government , in any argument of the law officers of the crown , in any opinion or decision of the courts of law . The question 433 had not involved the right of petitioning , or the merits of the claim of the Catholics ; it had arisen merely upon the form and constitution of a particular description of assembly of the people ; and upon the application of the provisions of the statute law of Ireland to that form and constitution . The right of petitioning could not have been denied , for it had not even been argued ; that great constitutional privilege was not now even a matter of argument ; it was placed beyond the reach of all question ; but even that exalted privilege was to be exercised according to law ; in Ireland , according to the law of Ireland : and the question at issue in Ireland had been , not whether the Roman Catholics should freely petition the crown or parliament , not whether their claims were just , but whether the description of assembly , which they had elected , and in which they met , was conformable to the law of the land : upon this question , solemnly argued , the decision of the court of King's-bench in Ireland was directly in favour of that construction of the statute law of Ireland , which the lord lieutenant and council had enforced by proclamation , with the advice of all the law officers of the crown , and for which the law officers of the crown had contended at the bar of justice . In the name of his Majesty 's servants , on the part of the Irish government , and of its respectable and honourable advisers , lord Wellesley denied every part of the noble earl 's charge . The Irish government was not authorised to question or to obstruct the right of petition , or to touch the claims of the Catholics . The Irish government had not attempted any such violence : such an attempt would have been repugnant to every sentiment of the honest heart of the noble duke , who represented his Majesty in Ireland , and who would have repudiated , with indignation , any instruction or advice tending to interpose his noble name and high authority between the people of Ireland , and their gracious sovereign , or the legislature of the united kingdom . The person ( Mr. Wellesley Pole ) who held the highest confidential charge under the noble duke in Ireland ( and in that person 's honour and fame lord Wellesley naturally felt a cordial and affectionate interest , ) was too well grounded in the principles of the constitution , and in habits of reverence for the law ; too deeply interested in the prosperity of Ireland and affectionately attached 434 to her welfare , to advise any violation of the rights or liberties of the people of Ireland.â€”That person was also of a firmness of mind , and a fortitude of spirit , that would never decline a resolute assertion of the laws of his country . In fact , the government of Ireland had committed no crime and no error , unless the firm and temperate assertion of the law of the land was criminal or erroneous . The Act , denominated the Convention Act in Ireland , was a law of prevention , founded on long
