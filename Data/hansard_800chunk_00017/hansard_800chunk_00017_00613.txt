licences in particular cases , such as he had alluded to , and the attempt to force the whole trade 1061 of the country into a channel , in which , to use the words of a learned judge , it must be carried on by `` simulation and dissimulation . '' `` But , '' said the noble earl , `` if the English merchants were not to carry on this trade , the Americans would , '' as if the Americans had no honour , and were prepared for any immorality in the pursuit of commercial profit . In discussing the value of the trade with America , the noble earl had stated that much the greater part of the exports from this country to the United States was not for consumption in that country , but for transmission by a circuitous route to France.— [ No ! to South America , observed earl Bathurst . ] —Well , that would not alter the argument , as the greater part was to be carried by this circuitous route to some place external to the United States ; and as the supply of South America had now devolved upon this country , the noble earl argued that we had lost nothing by the operation of the Orders in Council , or by the state of our relations with America , which was the consequence of them . The fact was—as had been incautiously admitted—that the South American exports had been before sent by a circuitous route through the United States , and ought not to be separated.—Next the noble earl renewed his recriminations , and asserted that during lord Grenville 's administration , in particular instances , licences were granted even to French vessels , thus giving trade to an enemy , rather than confining it to a neutral . Such assertions were completely ridiculous , because they were not denied , and were known to all the world ; but was that to be compared with a trade which existed only by licences , and those in every instance bestowed upon the enemy ? When he recollected the manner in which the Orders in Council , suggested by the present government , were supported , both in doors and out of doors , what unwearied pains were taken to make them popular , what false impressions were produced by ministers addressing themselves to the worst passions of men ; by telling them that the people of America were pusillanimous and degraded , and that they would bear any insults , and any outrages , he could not help expressing his surprise that the same persons who then , in so glaring a manner , shewed their jealousy of the trade of America , should , as it were , be dead to every impression of the same kind as applied to the trade of France , and should be ready to throw that commerce 1062 they refused to the United States , into the hands of the enemy . When the former administration granted , perhaps , fifty or sixty licences , where the present issue fifteen or sixteen thousand , or took any step which was deemed advisable for the salvation of the West Indies , what volumes upon volumes of papers were moved for by the opposition , what anxiety was expressed , what pamphlets after pamphlets were written to awake the slumbering attention of the country to the threatened destruction of the British shipping , by placing it in the hands of a neutral . But now it had been transferred almost in toto to France , or the countries dependent on her , the warning voice was silent , as if under some magical influence possessed by the noble lords opposite.—The principle advanced by his noble friend , was the true and wise and politic basis of the conduct that should be pursued by this country , namely , that all the trade which could not be carried on by English shipping , should be put into the hands of the Americans . To that principle , not an argument had been applied in
