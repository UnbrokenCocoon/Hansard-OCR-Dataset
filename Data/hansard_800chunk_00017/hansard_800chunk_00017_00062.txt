be confined to military and naval services ; and , in fact , political services were more liable to misrepresentation . But every general principle admitted of exceptions for salutary purposes ; and his lordship trusted , that what he had advanced , brought the present case within the scope of these useful exceptions . This was , in fact , to be considered as a military service , undertaken from the wisest political considerations , and with the most comprehensive and statesman-like views . In the consideration of lord Minto 's merit , the House should not , however , forget the gallant officers who had acted under him . In the conquest of the islands of Mauritius and Bourbon , they should recollect the wise arrangements and spirited conduct of General Abercromby ; and he had only to name commodore Broughton and Rowley , to excite in every heart sentiments of admiration and gratitude . As to Java , the governor-general wisely foresaw the danger of suffering the formidable preparations of the enemy to grow into maturity . He saw that a new empire was about to be created , which threatened the security 129 of our possessions in the East ; and sir Samuel Achmuty , impressed with the same ideas , in spite of the most disadvantageous circumstances , rushed on to strike a decisive blow , and pursued the flying enemy . To the merits of colonel Gillespie , and major generals Warde and Wetherall , the House could not be insensible . In short , those united exertions had not only wrested from the enemy the remains of an empire , but what was of more consequence , the beginning of a new one.â€”The noble earl , after recapitulating the praises he had already bestowed on the framer of those enterprises , and on the officers by whom he had been so ably seconded , trusted that the House would not refuse them the just reward of their services ; he then moved , `` That the Thanks of this House be given to the right hon .

'' rose to express his perfect concurrence in the praises bestowed by the noble Secretary of State on the governor-general of India . No doubt could be entertained but those valuable conquests were owing to his wise arrangements , and if a precedent had been wanting to vote the thanks of the House for political services , the present was a tit case to form one . His lordship then recapitulated the exertions of the officers employed in those expeditions so wisely planned , and whose services he considered not only as brilliant but as eminently useful . He could not , however , go to the length of approving the noble secretary of state , when he said that a system of colonial aggression was meant as a counterbalance for immense acquisitions on the continent ; for he was convinced , that such a vast increase of European dominions , must sooner or later carry with them ships , colonies , and commerce . His lordship had always been of opinion , that it would have been preferable for England to employ her 130 forces in resisting the enemy on the continent , than in conquering colonies , which only extended the already too vast cemetery of our brave soldiers . This was , however , the only observation he should make , and , as a soldier , he considered the noble Secretary
