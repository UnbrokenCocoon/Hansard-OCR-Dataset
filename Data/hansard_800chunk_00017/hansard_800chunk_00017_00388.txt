Charter would come on in the present session , he could not speak positively but he thought it probable , and he hoped that it would . An hon . gentleman had objected to what he called a negociation between government and the Company on the subject ; but for his part , he could not see how the subject could , according to the practice of the House , be brought forward without such negociation . If ministers previously exercised their judgment and discretion in the measure they brought forward , the House would have afterwards to exercise their judgment and discretion when the subject was submitted to them . He could could not see that there was any thing in this course of proceeding which deserved to be called a farce , or to be treated as mockery and delusion . As to the arrangement of 1792 , by which the Company were to pay 500,000l . per annum to the nation , that arrangement went entirely on the supposition of the continuance of peace . was putting the question , when rose , and said that he had intended to move , as an amendment to the motion , `` that it should be referred to a Committee of the whole House . '' He had concluded his speech , however , without making a motion , and he wished to know whether he was now in time . informed him , that it would be quite irregular now to move this amendment , after he had already spoken , and the discussion which had taken place . , after presenting two petitions from imprisoned debtors , observed , that notwithstanding parliament had so recently passed an insolvent act , he understood that the prisons were again almost as full as before .
