and strength of the empire , that the hereditary counsellors of the crown could never be employed more usefully to their sovereign , or to their country , than in examining the situation of Ireland , her resources , her internal administration , her happiness and welfare , and above all , the condition of the great body of her population . But although these topics must ever be present to their minds , the ancient usage and established practice of parliament required , that their lordships should consider deliberately the manner , and the season , in which this inquiry was pressed upon them . The magnitude and importance of the questions proposed , their general claim to attention , would not induce that House to enter hastily into the Committee , without previously adverting to the professed motives and objects of the intended enquiry , to the probable consequences of its progress , and to its ultimate result . Nor would their lordships advance one step in the course recommended by the noble mover , until they should have carefully examined what might be the operation of their vote upon the strength and honour of the executive government in Ireland , upon the due administration of the law in that country ; upon the law itself ; how the temper of the people and of contending parties might be moved by this proceeding ; and what might be the influence of the noble earl 's proposition , even upon the very point of his solicitude ; the interesting cause of the Roman Catholics of Ireland . The first ground , on which the noble earl had rested , was the supposed misconduct of the executive administration in Ireland , and the necessity of censuring its acts , and of arresting its career , in an alleged course of violence and injustice . What had he placed in the front of this great argument ? A vague report from a newspaper of that morning , imputing to an officer of the Irish government some interference in the return of the pannel of a jury . Until he ( Lord W. ) entered the House , this report had not reached him , and even if it had fallen under his observation , in a form so unauthentic , he would 432 not have deemed it of sufficient importance to constitute the ground of any proceeding in that assembly . But from further enquiry , he found that the court of King 's bench in Ireland , after solemn deliberation , had actually dismissed the complaint on which the noble earl rested this important branch of his proposition : nor was there any reason to apprehend , that any other circumstance in the trial now depending before that court had afforded a just motive of alarm for the safety of any principle of justice , of law , or of the constitution . Neither the dignity of the noble earl 's character could admit of any further attention on his part to that ground of his motion ; nor could their lordships deem such a transaction to be a sufficient cause for entering into the proposed inquiry , without any authentic fact , without even any public rumour of criminality , and with the knowledge , that the court of King's-bench in Ireland had dismissed from its bar , as trivial and groundless , the charge on which the noble earl required their lordships to proceed to a Committee of inquiry . From this particular charge , the noble earl had advanced to a more general and enlarged accusation , and had imputed to the Irish government a perversion of the law of Ireland , for the criminal purpose of obstructing the Roman Catholics of Ireland in the exercise of the sacred right of petition ; and this accusation was to form a principal object of inquiry in the Committee proposed to their lordships . If any reasonable ground of suspicion had existed to justify an apprehension that the government of Ireland had presumed to interfere between the subject and the crown , or between the people and the parliament
