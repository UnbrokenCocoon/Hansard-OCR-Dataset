system begun in 1806 , are desirous to understand how far that system has been supported , or its operations forwarded by the Orders in Council of January , 1807 . Some there are , too , who , not entirely disapproving of the new system at the period of its commencement , but induced by subsequent experience , and surprised at unexpected results , wish to perceive clearly and distinctly whether there are sufficient grounds to come to an alteration of their opinions . Others , still adhering to the wisdom of the policy , may entertain no little doubt as to the expediency of the mode in which it has been pursued ; and , advocates still for the principle , may see much to condemn in the manner by which it has been endeavoured to carry it into effect . They may think , that however necessary it may have been to sanction certain relaxations from the strictness of a general rule , the present system of relaxation is the most objectionable that could be adopted . Another class of persons there is , who originally supported the Orders in Council , because , feeling that the edicts of the enemy were of an unprecedented nature , they concluded that some new and grand experiment was called for to counteract them , but who are now anxious to ascertain the success of that experiment . There is also another class , ( among whom , in point of confidence in the justice of their opinions I rank myself foremost , but in influence and authority most humble ) , who , having opposed and reprobated the new system , from its earliest commencement , and having predicted from it the most ruinous consequences , are now prepared to shew 1094 that unfortunately for the country every prediction has been verified , and every anticipated evil accomplished , even beyond the most desponding apprehension—and as they think that no time is too late to turn aside from a course of blindness and ruin , they wish earnestly for an opportunity of exposing the blindness and of pointing out the ruin . Lastly , I have to enumerate a class of persons distinct from all these , a class of persons who undervalue all commerce and all manufactures , and consider the land and agricultural labour of a community as the only sources of real wealth , and the only constituents of national prosperity . These persons must , upon their own principle , be no less desirous of entering into the proposed inquiry , and of ascertaining what is the danger that in its progress must so nearly affect what they regard as the only true resources of the country , and which , if it does not menace , according to their theory , the safety of the country , at least tends to aggrandize the power of the enemy . To all these different classes of individuals , I now address myself , and agreeing , as they all do , in the points which I have stated , call upon them not to refuse to listen to the distressed voice of the people , but to vote in support of the motion for going into a committee . The object of this committee will be , to enquire into the effects of the Orders in Council , to enquire whether they have counteracted or assisted the policy of the enemy , what is the nature , the cause , and the extent of the distress felt throughout the country , and what is the most advisable remedy to be applied—whether it may be most expedient to retrace our steps , or prosecute the same course with additional vigour and effect . If we are to tell the people that the evils of which they complain are great , but irremediable , that they are not merely to be deplored , but endured , this language will not be the worse received for being prefaced by an impartial and accurate investigation into their causes . I have thought , Sir , that thus much might tend
