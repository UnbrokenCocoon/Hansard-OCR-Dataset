for protection and relief : the injustice under which British subjects thus suffered being notorious and flagrant , their complaints 283 were attended to by the British government , and much discussion took place between the two governments on the subject ; and that , for more than 10 years however , nothing effectual was done , and , during this lapse of time , debts originally good became bad , many of the debtors disappeared , and legal evidence became daily less attainable to support even such proceedings as had been evasively permitted in the American courts on the remonstrances of his Majesty 's government , but at length the complaints of his Majesty 's subjects , and the encreasing losses they sustained , were taken into full consideration , and a very elaborate article was concluded , which formed the sixth in the treaty of Amity , Commerce , and Navigation , concluded between his Majesty and the United States of America in the year 1794 , and by which it was agreed , That the United States should make full and complete compensation to the British creditors for the losses and damages which they had sustained by the operation of various lawful impediments to the recovery of their debts from the citizens or inhabitants of the United States since the peace ; and that for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of such losses and damages , five commissioners should be appointed , two by each of the contracting parties , and the fifth by those four , three of whom were to constitute a board with full power , provided one commissioner on each side and the fifth commissioner should be present ; and that all decisions should be made by the majority of the commissioners present , and their award be final and conclusive , both as to the justice of the claim and the amount of the sum to be paid to the creditor , and the United States undertook to cause the sums awarded to be paid to the creditors in specie without deduction ; and that in May 1797 , the commissioners appointed for that purpose having met at Philadelphia , proceeded in the execution of this article , and the claimants not only prepared their several claims and statements , including many thousands of debts and different transactions , with the evidence to be adduced in support of them , but they also sent agents to attend at Philadelphia before the board and to assist the general agent , who had been appointed under the authority of his Majesty 's government to direct their proceedings ; but this solemn article of treaty , with all that had been done under it ; was , after a great expence of time money and 284 labour , at once defeated by the conduct of the two commissioners appointed by the United States , for as soon as the discussions had arrived at that maturity which admitted of conclusive determinations on leading points , the commissioners appointed on the part of the United States on every occasion where those appointed by his Majesty and the fifth commissioner were ready to give an opinion and come to a vote different from theirs , or rather ( as they expressed it ) , 'inconsistent with the interests of the United States , withdrew from the board , and at length refused to give their attendance upon any occasion , except on condition that the opinions prescribed by them on the points in question should be the rule , and thus the proceedings of this board came to nothing ; and the petitioners , thus sorely disappointed and aggrieved , complained , through the proper channels , to his Majesty 's government , by whom the extreme hardship of their case , and the injury they had sustained , were fully acknowledged ; and the petitioners humbly conceive , that what thus took place in America amounted to a direct and positive breach of treaty on the part of the United States , for which his Majesty 's government had a right to insist on ample satisfaction
