excited in Ireland , 574 aware of the opinion expressed by parliament upon the subject , and aware of the declared determination of the Irish government not to suffer the continuance of such practices ; the meeting , aware of all these things , resolved , ( leaving out the Resolution which I have just read , disclaiming all representation , that the Committee should be re-appointed , and that the said Committee should consist of the Catholic peers of Ireland , of their eldest sons , of the Catholic baronets of Ireland , of the prelates of the Irish Roman Catholic Church , '' ( appointed then for the first time , ) `` of ten persons from each county in Ireland , and of five persons from each parish in Dublin , and the survivors of the delegates of 1793 . `` This was the mode in which the aggregate meeting of the Catholic body , with lord Fingall at their head , thought proper to proceedâ€”the very persons against whom it was said , that the Irish government had acted with intemperance and intolerance ; and , as if they were determined to remove every doubt that might by possibility exist of their real intentions , they determined that , until the new Committee should be assembled , `` the management of the Catholic affairs should be confided to the Catholic peers , baronets , and survivors of the delegates of 1793 . '' This was the first time , as I have already stated , that the Roman Catholic prelates of Ireland had ever been appointed to constitute a part of such a Committee . The meeting thus constituted would have amounted to about 473 persons . This convention of the three estates of the Roman Catholic body , ( for a more complete convention of these estates it was impossible to conceive , ) was appointed to meet in Dublin . I will fairly own , that when the lord lieutenant , and those who had the honour of advising him , saw those Resolutions , they were struck with the danger that might result from them . They felt that it was a melancholy thing , that a man of lord Fingall 's rank and character , should lend himself to such proceedings , particularly after what he had witnessed the year before , when he found that all his attempts were vain to repress the violence and factious language manifested in the debates , and when he found that their proceedings were of so dangerous a nature , as to render it necessary for him to secede . The government felt also , that in consequence of the Resolutions to which I have adverted , all those persons who had distinguished themselves 575 in the Old Committee for their violence and turbulence ; who had exerted themselves with the greatest assiduity and zeal to promote general irritation and discontent , would be members of the New Committee ; and in fact , there was not a man , no , not a single man , who had ever made a factious speech in the Old Committee , who was not chosen to form a part of the new . This Committee , then , with the advantage , if I may use the expression , of all the experienced advocates of faction of the Old Committee , and all the strength which would be derived from the members that were to be returned from the counties , if allowed to sit in defiance of the law , and to act , as they most undoubtedly would have acted , must have virtually annulled the government . If such a Convention , ( for I can not with propriety give it any other name , ) even if assembled for any purpose however legal , had been allowed to sit in the city of Dublin , it would have been impossible to have been responsible for the peace of that city for one moment . What were these people who were thus constituting themselves into so formidable a body ? I will tell the
