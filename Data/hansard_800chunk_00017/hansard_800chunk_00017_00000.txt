rose to move an Address of Thanks . All their lordships , he observed , must participate in the feelings expressed in the Speech , relative to the continuance of the unfortunate indisposition of his Majesty , and in the desire intimated by his Royal Highness , that in the provision to be made for the support of his Majesty , every facility should be given to his Majesty for resuming the personal exercise of the royal authority , if it should please Providence to restore him . After the number of years which his Majesty had reigned over the country , and when it was considered that , during his long reign , numerous Blessings had been conferred upon the people , that when every other state had been involved in misery and calamity , this country had alone escaped ; and that our thus remaining uninjured amidst the desolation that surrounded us , was chiefly to be attributed to the numerous virtues of his Majesty , he was convinced there could be but one feeling amongst their lordships upon the topics to which their attention was thus called by his royal highness the Prince Regent.—Upon the subject of Spain , there was much to congratulate the country in the unbroken spirit still displayed by the inhabitants of that kingdom , and in the various successes obtained against the enemy . If the House turned to Portugal , they would find ample sources of congratulation . In the course of last session , 6 Massena , with the French army , had been driven out of the country . Portugal had been since completely defended from the enemy ; and the campaign there had proved to the world and to the enemy , that it was not alone upon the sea , but on that element which he almost considered as his own , that British valour , led on by British generals , was equal to defeat him It was impossible to look on the gallant defence which the peninsula was making without admiration .

Our late successes in the East , the result of so much valour in the armies , and so much wisdom in those who planned the enterprize , reflected praise on the government abroad , and also on his Majesty 's ministers at home.—Respecting America , although there still unfortunately existed subjects of difference between this country and the United States , still it was highly satisfactory to be informed , that the affair of the Chesapeake had been happily terminated , and having the assurance of the Prince Regent that every measure of conciliation towards that country would be adopted that was consistent with the honour and the interests of this kingdom , there was every reason to hope that the whole of our differences would at length be amicably adjusted.—The concluding paragraph of the Speech brought him to the subject with which he began , and he trusted there would be no difference of opinion in adopting those measures which were necessary to the support of the Prince Regent in the exercise of the functions of the government ; a trust which he had shewn himself so eminently qualified to fulfil.—The noble earl concluded with moving an Address to his royal highness the Prince Regent , which was , as usual , an echo of the Speech . rose to second the Address . After the able manner in which it had been moved , it could scarcely be expected that he could add much to the remarks already made . He would , however , trouble the House with a few obser- 7 vations . He fully coincided with
