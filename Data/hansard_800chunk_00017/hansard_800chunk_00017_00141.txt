happened in the case of lord Shaftesbury ; he would en treat the House to reflect how they were arming the rapacity of the favourite , and with what weakness they were surrounding the throne ; how they were exposing the commerce , the prosperity , and the honour of England . If such a person as he had described were to exist , and if , what he was willing to believe more improbable still , he were to make his way into the counsels of his monarch , what a blow could he strike against the best interests of the country ? We had yet left , he would not say a single ally , but one remaining friend , and that friend was America . How naturally might a sovereign like the one he had fancied be induced by such a minister , as he had de scribed , to violate this solitary friend ship , and for purposes the most sordid and the most atrocious , hasten a rupture , and sweep into this fund the spoils of American commerce . He desired the House to consider also , that this most fata ) act , this last achievement of political profligacy , might be defended as strictly regular and legal ; justified by the laws and constitution of the realm , and not even requiring that solemn mockery of responsibility , a Bill of Indemnity . He was far from insinuating that such an event was likely to happen , it was sufficient for him and for parliament to know , that it had once happened . The hon . and learned member concluded with apologising for the time he had taken up , and observing , that at a moment when a new arrangement was about to be settled with the executive , he thought the subject of much too great importance to be neglected by a House of Commons , which had the right , a right which it was bound to exercise , of carrying into effect and practice those limitations , and that controul , which could alone make an English king in fact what he was in theoryâ€”a limited monarch .
