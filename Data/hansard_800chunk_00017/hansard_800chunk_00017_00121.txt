was only necessary to state to them that an estimate of the charges on the Civil List was drawn up in 1804 , that from 1804 downwards , the expenditure of each year greatly exceeded the sum of that estimate ; and that it was almost impossible that a more mature arrangement could take place than that of the Civil List in 1804 . He should proceed therefore to state to the House the principal articles on which he wished to have information . The first was an account of the bills paid each year in the department of the Lord Steward . In the estimate of 1804 , 75,000l . annually had been thought sufficient to meet all these bills ; and yet in the very next year , 1805 , they would find that they amounted to no less a sum than 129,924l . He did not say that this sum was too much , but he 224 certainly thought that it required explanation . In another year the expenditure in this department amounted to 107,000l . and in the last year it amounted to 115,424l . While he did not wish to express any opinion on this subject at present , he thought it was but fair to state that reports had gone abroad of considerable abuses existing in that department , and that these reports had come from a quarter which induced him to view the vast increase that had taken place with great jealousy . He implored the House , therefore , not to proceed farther in this business till they had examined , into the particulars of this expenditure . It was certainly singular enough , that the excess took place at the very moment when Mr. Pitt said that 75,000l . would be sufficient . He hoped that the right hon . the Chancellor of the Exchequer , would not object to the giving this detailed account . The next account he wished for was , that of the tradesmens ' bills in the department of the Lord Chamberlain . The extraordinary way in which affairs had been conducted in that department , would sufficiently appear when the particulars of this department of the Civil List were laid before the House . He would again implore the House to examine into this subject , to look into Mr. Pitt 's estimate and the estimates of all preceding administrations . Mr. Pitt conceived that 65,000l . would be amply sufficient for . the payment of all the tradesmens ' bills in this department on the 5th of July 1804 , and yet it appeared that the increase , here was even greater than in that of the Lord Steward ; for on the 5th of July 1805 , this estimated sum was more than doubled , the bills at that time being to no less an amount than 133,800l . In the next year the expenditure got up to 136,009l . in another year it was 124,000l . and then it fell to 95,000l . On the face of the documents now before the House , there was nothing to satisfy them respecting the cause of this rise and fall . In ' 1809 it rose to 149,618l . and fell in the following to 118,091l . and in a subsequent year to 101,669/ . In all this there was certainly an appearance of great imprudence . He did not conceive that the Lord Chamberlain was a person who had merely the direction of that department , without being obliged to look into its details , and to see that the expence should arise properly from the articles falling 1806 , 225 under it . He understood that the sums paid out here were principally for bills connected with furniture , a species of expence which might be increased without end . The House were surely bound to satisfy themselves on so important a subject as this , in order , if the expences were unwarrantable , that they might not occur again , and that , in making a permanent arrangement , they might not be considered as likely so to recur .
