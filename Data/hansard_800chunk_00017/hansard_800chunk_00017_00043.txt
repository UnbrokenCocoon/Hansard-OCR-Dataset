his Majesty 's health . It had been considered questionable , whether or not in the present stage of the proceeding , it was necessary to appoint any Committee for that purpose ; but as doubts had arisen in some quarters on that subject , it had been deemed advisable before the House proceeded to any ulterior measure , that they should enter into an inquiry by a Committee of their own ; the more especially as such an inquiry could be productive of very little delay . He therefore moved , '' That a Select Committee be appointed to examine the Physicians who have attended his Majesty , touching the state of his Majesty 's health since the examination of his Majesty 's Physicians before a Committee of this House in the last session of parliament , and to report such examination to the House . `` â€”The motion was agreed to , and a Committee accordingly appointed of 21 members , as follows : Mr. Secretary Ryder , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , the Master of the Rolls , Mr. Ponsonby , Mr. Wilberforce , Mr. Sheridan , the Attorney General , Mr. W. Adam , Mr. A. H. Eyre , Mr. C. Long , Mr. Tierney , lord Jocelyn , sir J. Newport , sir J. Nicholl , Mr. Whitbread , lord Castlereagh , lord Milton , Mr. Canning , lord G. Cavendish , Mr. H.

The Petitioner was a young woman of the name of Dix , residing in Bristol , and who , for two years , had been imprisoned in the gaol of that city , having been excommunicated by the sentence of the Ecclesiastical Court . The circumstances were briefly these . Two women , of whom the petitioner was one , fell out , and abused each other in the street . In consequence of some expressions made use of by the Petitioner , her opponent instituted a suit against her in the Ecclesiastical Court , and at the end of a year and a half , she was sentenced to perform penance . Having failed in this , she was ultimately excommunicated . A process afterwards issued out of the King's-bench , under 100 which she was arrested ; and , for two years , she had continued a prisoner in the gaol of Bristol . Being a pauper , she had no means of subsisting herself there , but was relieved by her father , who was himself a pauper , and received occasional assistance from charitable persons . As the costs of the suit amounted to 30l . and she was destitute of money , no hope of her liberation from prison could be entertained , unless by the intervention of the House .
