, they would also agree with him in thinking that it ought to be done with as much unanimity as possible ; for whatever differences of opinion might have existed in parliament at a time when the experiment of assisting Portugal had not been tried , now that it had been tried and proved successful , he trusted that a general disposition would ultimately be manifested to mark by an unanimous vote , the approbation with which the British parliament regarded the exertions of the Portuguese in the common cause , and the fidelity which they had manifested under those numerous circumstances of extreme peril and difficulty , to which the various fortunes of the war had necessarily exposed them . Without , therefore , dwelling at any length on the topics to which he had alluded , he would just call to the recollection of 1300 the committee , that when the principle of the present proposition was broached two years ago , a great disposition existed in parliament to doubt whether any military exertions which it might lend occasionally to Portugal , could be ultimately successful . Many gentlemen of high military character seemed inclined to believe that the Portuguese army , which it was the object of that proposition to raise and subsidise , could never be brought into such a state of discipline , as to render it efficiently serviceable . The division on that occasion exhibited a strong feeling in the minds of a great number of hon . gentlemen , that the encouragement in a military point of view held out by the proposition , was by no means adequate to the expence of it Those , however , who enjoyed more intimate means of judging of the probable result , pressed the vote upon the House ; it was passed ; and in the course of the year the efforts made in Portugal in consequence were such , that in the next session of parliament , even those who had opposed the proposition in the first instance , candidly allowed , that it had been productive of the most advantageous results . Accordingly when the proposition was again brought forward , those who had voted against it in the first instance , abstained from a repetition of that vote ; representing , however , at the same time , that although they admitted that the measure had produced great advantage ; yet that after all , the efforts of the combined British and Portuguese armies had ended only in shutting them up in the lines of Cintra , and leaving the enemy in possession of the remainder of Portugal . At least the committee would feel that this obstacle to an unanimous expression of sentiment was removed ; for the vote of the last session had enabled lord Welling on to drive the enemy over the frontier , and expel them wholly from Portugal . Parliament therefore was now called upon to contemplate a system , not which might lead , but which actually had led to the most brilliant success . The committee , in coming to the consideration of the present Resolution , would be divested of all those difficulties which had heretofore existed on the subject . He would , however , make a few observations on the principle upon which the present proposition rested . If ever there was a question of subsidy which could be maintained on sound , legitimate , and justifiable grounds , it was this . In the first place , it was subsidising a power 1301 with which we were connected by a kind of natural feeling . Indeed , it could hardly be considered in the light of a subsidy ; for the measure afforded such effectual aid to the British army , charged as that army was with important operations , comprehending our own essential interests , that the money might with propriety be voted on that view of the subject alone , and without any particular reference to Portugal , for it was impossible not to admit , that all those splendid exertions of lord Wellington would have fallen very short
