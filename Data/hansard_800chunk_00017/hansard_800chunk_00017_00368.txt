. the Secretary for Ireland , while he travelled to Dublin in his post-chaise , appeared to have been employed in reading the news-papers , and in taking for granted all that those publications asserted to have been done and said by the Catholics . The right hon gentleman had , indeed , attacked members of that House for expressions and sentiments which they never uttered , but which the Morning Post had put into their mouths for them.â€”Happy was it for England and Ireland that the earl of Fingall had been placed at the head of the Catholics in the latter country : he was a man who to high rank and large fortune added such a sound judgment , such suavity of as manners , and yet such spirited conduct , enabled him to unite Catholics and Protestants in one common interest . He thanked God that the man who represented the Catholics of Ireland was the earl of Fingall . 653 The noble lord who had just sat down had told the House , that if they conceded to the claims made by the Catholics of Ireland , they must do the same by the Catholics of Great Britain . Certainly , it ought to be so Nay more , the Test Act must be repealed ; and the dissenters must be allowed to come in for their share of relief from civil incapacities . And where was the danger to the Established Church from all this ? These fears about the Established Church were sounded in the ears of the country as often as the present question was agitated . Were the Catholic claims to be granted ? the Church would be overturned ! Were the Dissenters to be relieved from tests which were Virtually abrogated every year ? the Church would be overturned ! He was himself a member of the Established Church ; and it was his anxious desire to fortify that establishment by divesting it of some of those prerogatives which were at present an incumbrance to it , and the removal of which could not fail of producing the most beneficial results . No man who knew any thing of the purity of the principles of the Church establishment , and considered the deep root which it had taken in the minds of all Protestants who had any regard to religion , together with the many guards and fences by which it was surrounded , could entertain any reasonable apprehension of its destruction , except by its own corruptions and by the culpable indolence of its professors . The alarm about the church of England , however , was by no means peculiar to the present period or to the present circumstances . A grave and learned divine bad lately attempted to prove , in a book written on purpose , that the Church was threatened with imminent danger by the dissemination of copies of the Bible , divested of any gloss or comment Nay , he had himself been accused in a publication by a professor , of divinity at Cambridge , of seeking to overturn the Church , in consequence of a speech which he had made at a meeting of one of the Bible societies in the country ! Such apprehensions he could not otherwise denominate than as the `` Fears of the brave , and follies of the wise . '' The right hon . Secretary had expressed a hope that the Catholics would petition the Prince Regent rather than petition parliament . From what he had heard , he understood it to be their actual intention to petition the Prince Regent , stating 654 their claims to his Royal Highness , and praying his interference in their behalf by recommending their case to the consideration of parliament . That such a recommendation would be successful no one could doubt . Most dangerous was the advice of the right hon . gentleman opposite ( Mr. Canning ) to delay the concessions until the Catholics had sunk into a state of flat despair . `` Good God !
