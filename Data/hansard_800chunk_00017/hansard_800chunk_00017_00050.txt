just submitted to the House , together with two others of a similar nature , which he understood it was his intention also to propose . With respect to two of these three motions , he had no hesitation in objecting to them , because they would produce only what would be found in the annual accounts , which by law must be laid before parliament . When those accounts should come before the House , the hon . gent . might extract such parts as he required , and on them found any motion that he thought proper . As to the third motion , he had told the hon . gent . that if he would wait twenty-four hours , he would inquire whether the papers to be produced by it were in the same predicament as those to which he had just alluded , and if not that he would consent to their immediate production . said , that he understood his hon . friend to wish not for the details of the accounts , but for the result . It was well known that the detailed accounts were never presented until a very late period of the session , and he contended that such a mode of opposition as that resorted to by the right hon . gent . would put a stop to all motions for papers relative to Finance . denied that these accounts were presented at a period so late as that , described by the right hon . gent . He had no objection whatever to the production of the information , but he saw no reason for departing from the ordinary course . thought the opposition of the right hon . gent . quite novel in its kind . During his short experience of parliament , he bad every session seen motions agreed to , for papers in distinct anticipation of the annual accounts . The papers moved for by his hon . friend were indispensible , in order to remove the anxiety which the mutilated statements in the public prints respecting the Revenue , had occasioned in the public mind . It was well known that a large volume of public accounts was usually presented about March ; that it was then sent to the printer 's , and that it was towards the end of the session before the House obtained that financial information so desirable at an earlier period . It was singular that while the right hon . gent . was opposing the present motion , his noble colleagues had , as he understood , acceded to a similar one in the other House . repeated that he had no objection to the production of the information ; but that if the ordinary course was sufficient for that purpose , it appeared to him to be idle to depart from it . If the hon . gent . would withdraw his motion , and give notice of it for to-morrow , by that time he should be enabled to ascertain how far the above observation was applicable to it . consented to withdraw his motion for the present , and to give notice of it for tomorrow , but not for the reasons alledged by the right hon . gent . He distrusted the financial statement which the right hon . gent . had yesterday made ; and he was anxious before that most important subject , the state of the finances , should come to be discussed , that the House should be in possession of all possible information with respect to it . proceeded to propose the revival of the Resolution of last session , by which alternate precedence was given throughout the week to Orders and Notices ; and for that purpose , moved , `` That in this present session of parliament , all Orders of the day , set down in the Order book for Mondays and Fridays , shall be disposed of before the House will proceed upon any motions of which notices shall be entered in the order book . '' allowed that a regulation like the present might afford
