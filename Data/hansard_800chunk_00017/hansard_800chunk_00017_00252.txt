usage of ages , and leading to the venerable fabric of liberty and order . The government of Ireland also deserved well of the Catholics for having enforced the law against their leaders , and ' for having by law abolished an assembly , which could not have continued , without exciting just alarm in every loyal and patriotic breast , and without involving the general cause of the Catholics in the character of that representative body , to which they had entrusted their affairs . But if their lordships should agree to the Committee on the argument of the noble lord , they must be prepared to declare that this plan of a Convention was not only legal , but laudable and meritorious . Some persons were of opinion , that the Roman Catholics ought to be admitted to sit and vote in parliament , and to every other advantage enjoyed by Protestants ; but , in the interval , were their lordships inclined to sanction , in place of the Protestant parliament of Ireland , an assembly of the Roman Catholic nobility , prelacy , gentry , and Commons , to sit publicly in Dublin , and to debate and resolve upon all subjects of law , government , politics , and religion ? Would their lordships declare , that this was an excellent institution , calculated to preserve the peace of Ireland , and to maintain the laws and establishments in that country in Church and State inviolate , while we should be employed on this side of the Channel in deliberating upon the respectful petitions , which that high council might be pleased to certify , and transmit for our approbation ? Their lordships could not agree to the 438 Committee , when the sanction of these illegal conventions was presented as a principal object of the noble earl 's proposal . Justice to the government of Ireland , justice to the interests of Ireland , and above all , justice to the Roman Catholics of Ireland , precluded the possibility of yielding to the noble earl in this part of the question . From his animadversions on the conduct of the government of Ireland , the noble earl had passed to the more important objects of the proposed Committee , â€”to consider the condition of the Roman Catholics of Ireland ; their claim on the justice of parliament ; and the necessity of proceeding to the immediate removal of the civil disabilities of which they complained . declared , that he approached the interesting cause of the Roman Catholics , with a solicitude for its success which could not be surpassed , even by the ardour of the noble earl . From the first dawn of his reason to the present hour , his anxiety for the effectual relief of the Roman Catholics of Ireland had been the warm sentiment of his heart , confirmed and animated by successive experience and reflection , and by the deliberate exercise of his judgment , not unaccustomed to the practical consideration of great affairs of state : he was born , bred , and educated in these principles of rational liberality , equally remote from intolerant bigotry , and from licentious disregard of established order . He had alleys supported every former proposal for the relief of the Roman Catholics : if for a moment , in a period of peculiar and extraordinary embarrassment , he had suspended the active exertion of his opinions on this subject , the suspense had been to him most painful and irksome ; it had been occasioned merely by a conviction , that more danger was to be apprehended to the Roman Catholics , and to the state , from a premature attempt to urge their just claim , than from a prudent delay of that claim , in submission to the character and circumstances of the times . It was necessary , however , to explain distinctly the foundations and limits of his opinions on the claim of the Roman Catholics , because he apprehended , that he did not agree with any of the declared champions in this conflict .
