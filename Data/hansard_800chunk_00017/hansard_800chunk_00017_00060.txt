but if I am to be precluded from addressing a few observations to the chair , let the House remember that the right hon . gent. , the Prince Regent 's first minister , has prevented an Irish memberâ€” said , he had already stated what was the order of proceeding in that House . , after an experience of 30 years as a member of that House , entirely agreed with the Speaker as to the usage laid down by him . , after a short interval , stated that he rose with the intention of giving notice of a motion on a subject of the very last importance , and he hoped to be indulged with permission to stale , shortly , his reasons for making the motion of which he was now to give notice . again spoke to order . It was an established rule of the House , that no member , in giving notice of a motion for a future day , should be permitted to anticipate the debate of that day , by assigning the reasons by which he was actuated in giving his notice . The propriety of this rule was apparent , because there being no opportunity afforded on the other side of answering the reasons adduced , an undue prejudication of any particular question might thereby be occasioned . He was aware of the force of this objection on the present occasion , and was desirous of guarding the House and the public against any premature impression which the ingenuity and eloquence of the hon . gent . was calculated and likely to produce . held , that it had been the 126 uniform practice of the House to confine members giving notice of a motion , to the precise purport of the motion , and the day on which it was to be brought forward . then gave notice that he should , on the first Tuesday in March , move for the Repeal of the Legislative Union between Great Britain and Ireland . , in rising to make his promised motion for a Vote of Thanks to the right hon .

But , in the present instance , he was not apprehensive that a want of sufficient merit could be urged , as an objection to the proposed Vote of Thanks . The House were not called upon to thank the Governor-General of India for a single service , but for a general system of operations , conceived in the most profound wisdom , executed with the most active determination , and attended with the most brilliant exploits . Those exertions had been eminently successful ; and that success had been principally owing to the arrangements made by the noble lord , to whom he then proposed the thanks of the House should be voted . Considering the present system of aggrandisement on the continent of Europe , which France had too successfully practised , it had been thought advisable by the government of this country , to retaliate by attacking the colonial power of the enemy , in every part of the world . For it was obvious , that as long as he could retain a place of rendezvous , or shelter his privateers and fit out expeditions , our trade would be liable to annoyance , far exceeding , in amount , the expences of expeditions intended to deprive him of his last shelter . Under these cir- 127 cumstances , it was thought necessary to make France feel , that the ocean
