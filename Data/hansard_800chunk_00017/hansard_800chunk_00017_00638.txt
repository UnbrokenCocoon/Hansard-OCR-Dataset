the corresponding three quarters of 1811 , we exported only to the amount of 16,397,311l . ; so that here is a falling off of nearly 11 millions in the amount of British manufactures exported in three quarters of one year only ; and if a proportionate allowance be made for the other quarter , the falling off will then be between 14 and 15 millions of official value in the amount of British manufactures alone in a single year , which sum of between 14 and 15 millions of official value corresponds to somewhat between 20 and 21 millions of real value . It appears , then , that there is not such a discrepancy between the Gazette and the Custom-house books as from the cheering of the hon . gentlemen opposite one would be led to suppose . But the right hon . gentleman will say , `` It is true there is a falling off in the amount of last year compared with 1810 , but 1810 happens to be the greatest year of exports ever known , and there is no falling off when we compare last year with 1809 . '' But here again the right hon . gentleman will find himself in some difficulty , for it appears that there is a falling off of two millions last year , when compared with 1809 ; for 1809 was within nine millions of 1810 . Thus it appears that we must go back to the year 1808 for a comparison ; and it is to be considered , that if there is a falling off in the last year compared with . 1808 , it is a falling off compared with the very worst year ever known in this country , for in the year 1808 there was a decrease in the exportation of British manufactures of about 15 millions as compared with 1807 ; and therefore if there is a falling off in 1811 compared with 1808 , we have a right to conclude that there is a falling off compared with the very worst year that could be selected . How then does the fact stand ? In the 3 quarters ending the 10th of October 1808 , the British manufactures exported amounted to 18,013,043l . ; and in the corresponding quarters of 1811 they amounted to 16,397,311l. , being a decrease of nearly two millions . We have not yet got the 1103 accounts of imports for the last year , and I believe that they can not be presented for more than two months . We know , however , enough to allow me to state with confidence , that in the imports there has also been a falling off ; and that the imports in the year 1811 fell off nearly as much as the exports . Upon the whole , then , it appears , that there has been a falling off in the year 1811 , compared with the very worst year , namely , 1808 . But on this subject I think I shall be able to say something to shew why the Custom-house Returns are at best but of doubtful authority , and are not to be trusted when they appear to speak a different language from that of all descriptions of people in the country . It is to be observed , from the Accounts presented to the House , that in 1809 the exportation to North and South America , and the British Settlements , amounted to 8 millions more than that of 1807 ; and the exportation to the countries of Europe to 12 millions more than in 1807 . Such was the statement on the face of the documents . This would at first sight induce any one to draw the most favourable conclusions respecting the state of the country ; but when we know bow different the state of the country really is , we must look for the cause of this apparent contradiction . There are a sort of prying people in this country , who are not quite disposed to pin their faith implicitly to Mr. Irving 's books
