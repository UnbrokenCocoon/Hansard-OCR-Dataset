conduct of his Majesty 's troops , and of the allies , in these various and important services , we concur with his Royal Highness in rendering justice to the consummate judgment and skill displayed by general lord viscount Wellington in the direction of the campaign : `` That we rejoice to find , that in Spain the spirit of the people remains unsubdued , and that a system of warfare , peculiarly adapted to the actual condition of the Spanish nation , has been recently extended and improved , under the advantages which result from the operations of the allied armies on the frontier , and from the countenance and assistance of his Majesty 's navy on the coast : `` That , although the great exertions of the enemy have , in some quarters , been attended with success , we cordially concur with his Royal Highness in admiring the perseverance and gallantry manifested by the Spanish armies ; and have received , with pleasure , the information that , even in those provinces , principally occupied by the French forces , new energy has arisen among the people , and the increase of difficulty and danger has produced more connected efforts of general resistance : `` To assure his Royal Highness , that we 39 will not fail to continue to afford the most effectual aid and assistance in support of the contest which the brave nations of the peninsula still maintain with such unabated zeal and resolution : `` To offer his Royal Highness our hearty congratulations on the success of the British arms in the island of Java ; and to assure his Royal Highness of our concurrence in his approbation of the wisdom and ability with which this enterprize , as well as the capture of the islands of Bourbon and Mauritius , has been conducted under the immediate direction of the governor-general of India ; and that we agree with his Royal Highness in applauding the decision , gallantry , and spirit conspicuously displayed in the late operations of the brave army under the command of that distinguished officer , lieutenant-general Sir Samuel Auchmuty , so powerfully and ably supported by his Majesty 's naval forces : `` To express the pleasure which we derive from considering that , by the completion of this system of operations , great additional security will have been given to the British commerce and possessions in the East Indies , and the colonial power of France will have been entirely extinguished : `` That we will not fail to take into our consideration the propriety of providing such measures for the future government of the British possessions in India , as shall appear from experience , and upon mature deliberation , to be calculated to secure their internal prosperity , and to derive from those flourishing dominions the utmost degree of advantage to the commerce and revenue of the United Kingdom : `` To convey our humble thanks to his Royal Highness , for the information , that while his Royal Highness regrets that various important subjects of difference with the government of the United States of America still remain unadjusted , the difficulties which the affair of the Chesapeake frigate had occasioned , have been finally removed ; and to express our gratitude to his Royal Highness for his gracious assurance that , in the further progress of the discussions with the United States , his Royal Highness will continue to employ such means of conciliation as may be consistent with the honour and dignity of his Majesty 's crown , and with the due maintenance of the maritime and commercial rights and interests of the British empire : 40 `` To return our humble thanks to his Royal Highness for having directed the estimates for the service of the current year to be laid before us , and to assure his Royal Highness that we will cheerfully furnish him with such supplies as may be necessary to enable him to continue the contest in which his Majesty is engaged , with that spirit and exertion which will afford the best prospect of its successful termination
