Lords ' Act , it was his intention to afford relief to those unfortunate persons , by introducing another Bill ; and in consequence of that idea , he had received a vast number of letters , full of suggestions for their benefit . He had no intention of pursuing the subject any further , but he wished that some gentleman would examine the various acts lately passed for their relief , and see if some alteration of the provisions could not be made so as to include those persons now soliciting relief . Though an Act had passed within the last twelve months upon the subject , he understood the different gaols in the kingdom were fuller than before it passed . It was necessary , therefore , he thought , that something should be done to remedy the evil . A Petition , he understood , had been put into the hands of a noble member of the other House ( lord Redesdale ) , who was fully competent to frame a Bill for the 1170 desired purpose , and he trusted it would be done , and be carried into effect . presented a Petition of the mayor , sheriffs , and commonalty of Cork , setting forth : `` That the franchises of markets , tolls , and customs , and the regulation of all weights and measures within the said city , have been vested , by virtue of their several charters of incorporation , from the reign of king Henry the 3rd until the present time , in the mayor , sheriffs , and commonalty of the said city ; and that , by a statute passed in Ireland in the 4th year of queen Ann , it was enacted that the chief magistrate in all corporate towns , and the proprietors of the tolls and customs in all other places , should appoint weigh-masters within their several jurisdictions , who should be sworn justly and truly to weigh all goods , wares , and merchandizes between buyer and seller , for which service they should be entitled to the fees provided by the said act ; and that , in the reign of king William the 3rd , when first the trade of butter became an object of legislative regulation in Ireland , the inspection of its qualify , and the ascertainment of its weight , were committed to the chief magistrates in corporate towns , as incident to their corporate right ; and that , by a statute passed in Ireland in the 8th year of king George the 1st , distinct weigh-masters were first appointed for the weighing butter , hides , and tallow , and the chief magistrates in all corporate towns were empowered to nominate the weigh-masters within their respective jurisdictions , thereby evidently recognizing and confirming , as the Petitioners submit , the ancient corporate right hereinbefore mentioned ; and that , by another statute passed in Ireland in the 10th year of king George the 1st , various additional regulations for the butter trade of Ireland were introduced , but the appointment of weigh-masters was still vested in the chief magistrates and aldermen of the several corporate towns , Dublin and Cork only excepted , and it is to this exception , and to the unjust and unequal consequences which flowed from it , that the Petitioners beg leave humbly to call the attention of the House , as the causes of the grievance of which they complain , for , by a subsequent 1171 section of the said act , the appointment of weigh-masters in the city of Dublin was re-vested in the mayor , together with the sheriffs , commons , and citizens of Dublin , in which body it remains to the present day , whereas , in Cork , the place of weigh-master was granted by name to Edmond Knapp and Edward Hoare , the then representatives in parliament of the said city , and to the survivor of them , though contrary to the express wish of the mayor , sheriffs , and commonalty of the said city , as appears by
