the Regent . Upon the subject of the Roman Catholics , his sentiments had not changed in the slightest degree . When he before had 1024 the honour of forming a part of administration , he had differed with his right hon . friend , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , on the principle of the question . He was friendly while his right hon . friend was directly opposed to their claims ; but he was against the agitation of the subject at that time , and he still remained of the same opinion . It might be right for the House to be informed of the principles which actuated hon . gentlemen on the other side of the House ; and it was fortunate that they had to night been stated in a manner which rendered equivocation impossible . Does , or does not , ( said the noble lord ) lord Grenville stand to his professions in the letter he addressed to the earl of Fingal ? ( Repeated cries of hear ! hear ! from Opposition ! ) It may be so ; but if any judgment can be formed from the sentiments expressed during the debates , I should say that he dismissed from his mind the whole system of guards and regulations laid down so distinctly in that letter . If the representations published are correct , I find his lordship in another place , within a short period exclaiming with vehemence , 'Where is the danger to the establishments ? Why do you not give an immediate assent to the demands , before you are compelled to do so ? Surely this is not very consistent conduct ; for there is no allusion made to any of the important safeguards before so much dwelt upon ; and when I read in the Letter of lords Grey and Grenville , that it is impossible for them to come into power , for ever so short a time , without recommending the immediate repeal of all the penal statutes against the Catholics , and no allusion to any protection for the Protestant church , I own I can not help being surprised . The conclusions drawn by the hon . gentleman who spoke last , make it clear that the change of system must be general and fundamental , and the real question now to be decided is , whether an act shall be done which shall compel the Prince Regent , contrary to the determinations of his mind , to change his government , for the purpose of enabling that government to advise his Royal Highness to repeal all the laws of restriction upon the Catholics . I am friend to the Catholic cause , under certain regulations , still . ( Hear ! hear ! and a laugh from Opposition ) . These marks of triumph I can easily understand they mean that those who shew them stand upon sure ground : but unless such a government can be formed as may induce 1025 the Regent to revoke the opinion he has given , the Bill may be brought in , but it can never become a law , and the new ministers must quit their seats in six weeks after they have occupied themâ€”His lordship then proceeded to notice the curious reason that had been assigned for this change in opinion in the noble lords alluded to , which was the increased danger of the times . He was at a loss to discover it , whether he looked to our external or internal relations . Unless victory added to our insecurity , which might , perhaps , be contended by the other side , he could not ascertain the smallest ground for the assertion . In Ireland he thought that for political purposes the accounts of disturbances had been grossly exaggerated ; but if the Catholic emancipation were acceded to , they would not be confined to Ireland , and we might rue in England the baneful consequences of rashly granting a measure contrary to the well grounded prejudices of the great mass of the community . `` I wish (
