transactions , it will be obvious to common observation , as I stated in the opening , are marked with distinguished and almost singular merits : I say it will be obvious to common observation , because persons unacquainted , like myself , with military tactics , will find themselves greatly assisted in appreciating the value of this signal triumph , by having an opportunity to compare these proceedings with those of a similar attack directed against the same place ; and the House and the country , upon the present occasion , possess the peculiar advantage of forming a contrast most decidedly in favour of our gallant army . Lord Wellington , it will be recollected , invested Ciudad 710 Rodrigo after it had been most materially strengthened by all the military skill which the French engineers are acknowledged to possess , on the 8th January , and on the 19th January the British army took possession , having been engaged only twelve days in commencing and completing their works , and in accomplishing their glorious project . What is the fact with regard to the French army , when it sat down before the same place , not deficient in any of the ordinary means of attack , and by far more numerous than the allied army ? It is true , that the garrison , on the present occasion , was smaller in number , but far superior in discipline , being composed of the most experienced and tried soldiers of the French army , among whom were engineers , who , with consummate skill and ability , directed the employment of every means of resistance that could be devised . Marsha ) Massena sat down before the place on the 11th of June , 1810 , broke ground on the 15th , opened his fire on the 24th , and the place did not surrender until the 10th July , comprehending a space of thirty day employed by the French , in investing , attacking , and obtaining the same fortress , which subsequently , much improved and strengthened , yielded to British intrepidity after a siege of only twelve days . The facts , as simply detailed , give to the House a much more just impression of the almost unexampled courage and ability displayed in this achievement , than any language of mine can possibly convey . I believe there is scarcely a gentleman in the House who has not had some opportunity , by means of private communications from those who were eye witnesses of the scene , of properly estimating this brilliant conquest , in which every local circumstance was taken advantage of by the general , and his judicious views seconded by the zealous support and determined gallantry of those whom he commanded . I know not if it be necessary for me to submit to the House any further observations upon this subject , being satisfied that the impression upon the mind of every honourable member will be so strong , that it will be in vain for me to attempt to add to it . I am sure that the House will concur with me in opinion , that the present case fully deserves that distinguished mark of approbation which parliament is always happy to be enabled by events , to confer upon the gallant defenders of their 711 country and their allies . I shall therefore content myself with moving , '' That the Thanks of this House be given to general lord viscount Wellington , for the skill , decision , indefatigable exertions , and consummate judgment manifested by him in the recent siege of Ciudad Rodrigo , by which that important fortress has been wrested from the enemy in the short space of eleven days . '' seconded the motion , and begged to add a few expressions of admiration , flowing , not merely from his lips , but dictated by his heart . It was impossible , he said , to add any thing , by brilliancy of description , to the lustre of the late transaction ; but as the oldest general in
