persons , who stand between the extremes of two opposite opinions , and who therefore can not hope to satisfy the professors of either , I feel myself obliged to trespass for some short time on the attention of the House , while I declare my sentiments , fairly and explicitly , upon this most important subject , which the motion of my noble friend brings under our consideration . I regret that such a motion has been brought forward . I regret it from an apprehension , which was excited in my mind by the notice given on the first day of the session , and which the speech of my right honourable and learned friend has certainly not been calculated to diminish , —that the discussion is not at this moment likely to be attended with any chance of practical benefit . The question of the Roman Catholic claims , which alone gives importance to this night 's debate , is so mixed up with other matter in the motion now proposed to us , that it is presented in the most unfavourable point of view . A question of transcendent and permanent national interest , is blended with a dispute about the construction of an act of parliament , and about the dispersion of an assembly of doubtful legality : and it is so contrived , by this mode of proceeding , that no man , however inclined , could give his vote in favour of entertaining the Catholic claims to-night , without at the same time passing a censure upon the conduct of the Irish government . While I lament the introduction of this motion , however , I have been somewhat consoled by seeing it fall into the hands of my noble friend . My noble friend is not responsible for the policy of bringing it forward ; and even those who are most at variance with him , must concur in applauding the ability and discretion with which he has discharged the task devolved upon him . Agreeing with my noble friend in many—perhaps in most points of his argument , but differing from him as to his conclusion , I shall state the points 516 in which we agree , with all the satisfaction that I derive from the co-incidence of my own opinion with that of a person whom I so much value ; a I trust that I shall be able to state the grounds of my difference on the points in which we differ , with that temper and moderation of which he has set me the example . My noble friend was so sensible of the disadvantage arising to that part of his subject , which he had most at heart , from its association with the transactions which occurred in Ireland in the course of last summer , that he was almost unwilling to acknowledge that those transactions had influenced him in any degree in bringing his motion forward . But as the motion is notoriously intended to embrace the conduct of the Irish government ; as the affirming my noble friend 's proposition in the sense in which it is offered for our adoption would be to pronounce the interference of the Irish government with the proceedings of the Catholic committee , an illegal interference ; they who are not prepared for the declaration of such an opinion , must necessarily give the motion their decided negative . I am willing to own that , individually , I should have entertained some doubts , â priori , whether the act of parliament , to which reference has been so often made , was intended by its framers to operate against such meetings as those of the Catholic Committee . But I must nevertheless fairly declare , that had I been in a responsible situation in the government of Ireland , and had I been advised by the law officers of the crown that such was , in their opinion , the unquestionable construction of the act , I should have felt that I was taking upon myself a most grievous and heavy responsibility , if , in
