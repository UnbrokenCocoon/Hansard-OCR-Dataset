who had no Common judge , or no superior tribunal to appeal to . If he should be able to prove , that there was such a measure of self-preservation and urgency as to justify the measure , it would be confessed that it was executed in the mildest manner possible ; and that this country had put forward no greater degree of force and violence , than was absolutely necessary to accomplish those objects which appeared to his majesty 's advisers to be of the most urgent and indispensable necessity.â€”In stating the grounds upon which he considered the measure to be strictly justifiable , he should resolve them into the following heads : 1 . Whether the house believed that there was a design on the part of the enemy to form a great maritime confederacy against this country , and to lay hold of the fleet of Denmark to effect this purpose ; 2 . Whether it was practicable for him to carry this design into execution , either by absolute force or intimidation ; and , 3dly , Whether . the object was of sufficient magnitude and importance to justify a deviation from the 371 ordinary rules of proceeding . On the first point , as to the intention of Buonaparte , there could be little or no doubt . At the time of the signing of the Treaty of Tilsit , no one entertained a doubt but that it was his object to oblige all the maritime powers to join in a great confederacy against our commerce and our very existence as a nation . He never concealed that such was his intention . It was expressly stated in the French bulletins , and in many of the official papers . It appeared not only from these written documents , but from his practice . In his treaties with Mecklenburgh and Oldenburgh , as well as with Prussia , the exclusion of the British navy and commerce from all their ports was expressly stipulated . The justification of Prussia upon the subject , was , that it was not a particular measure with respect to her , but that it was a part of the general system of the continent , to which they were obliged to conform . Besides these general grounds which were , however , sufficient to remove every possibility of doubt , his majesty 's ministers acted from positive information which they had received , of the designs of France to force the navies of Denmark and Portugal to act hostilely against this country . Very shortly after his majesty 's present ministers came into office , they sent 10,000 men to Pomerania , to assist the king of Sweden , and had a fleet and considerable body of troops to send afterwards to the Baltic , as reinforcements to the cause of their ally . Before the sailing of this fleet , that information arrived which determined them to direct this force against Copenhagen . It was not unusual for parliament to act upon a fact distinctly stated to them by his majesty 's ministers ; but , in the present case , all the confidence which ministers required was , that parliament would believe them when they stated , that they at that time knew the fact , which every body knows at present , and of which there could not be a doubt . They had received the most authentic information from Portugal , that that country had been invited into a general confederacy against us , and to join her navy to that of Denmark and the other continental nations . A short time afterwards , the French minister at Lisbon , by a note dated the 12th of August , positively required that Portugal should make war against England ; that , she should seize the persons and properties of all Englishmen in Portugal ; and that they should join their fleet to that of Den- 372 mark and the other continental powers . Was there any body who could believe that Denmark alone was to be excepted from the nations of the continent , whom the
