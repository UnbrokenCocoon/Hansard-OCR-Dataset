to contend , that the acts of those noble lords , and this we are now revising have any the smallest resemblance ? —True , lord Cornwallis , at a moment when the subsidy had been for a considerable time in arrear , apprehensive of the failure of it , and considering the failure imputable to the mismanagement of the then nabob Asoph-ul-Dowlah , urged him less in the strong language of remonstrance , than the affectionate warmth of friendship , to remedy the errors and defects Of his government ; he even , from a 1094 similar motive , interfered with his remonstrance and advice , as to the members of the , nabob 's government . But let gentlemen recollect , that not even threats were resorted to ; strong remonstrance and repeated advice were the only weapons of force he used , or pretended the right to use ; every other he specifically and repeatedly disclaimed , as inconsistent with the relative state of the governments , and their respective independence . But can any thing be a more conclusive proof of the continued opinion of this noble lord , of the injustice , and even the impolicy of interference with the government of India , contrary to subsisting treaties , than the very last act of the life of this respected nobleman ; who , when at the close of a long life , actively and usefully employed in the cause of his country , he was sent over to India to repair , as far as possible , all the errors of former administrations , and to retrieve the character of the country , would permit no consideration of interest or advantage to the company 's affairs , to be pleaded against the faith arid honour of Britain . In answer to a letter written by colonel Close , the resident at Poonah , describing the sad condition of the Peishwah 's government , and the more than inclination , the almost request of the Peishwah for the interference of the British in the internal regulation of his dominions , and the compliance with which request colonel Close considers as the only means of rendering the treaty of Bassein any other than a burthen on the company ; lord Cornwallis , after acknowledging the force of the resident 's arguments and conclusions , writes thus : —'It is one of the fundamental principles of the treaty of Bassein and constitutes one of its express provisions , that the British government is not to interfere in the internal administration of his highness 's dominions ; '' and his lordship then directs the resident to decline all the offers of interference , and actual prepositions of substitution of the British government for that of the Peishwa , which had been made to the resident . In the same manner , sir , we find , when col. Kirkpatrick , the resident at Hydrabad ( who had been lord Wellesley 's secretary , and of course inclined to further his views and projects of interference and reform ) , in no less than six several dispatches to the Bengal government , had pressed the necessity of establishing a body of Sillahdar cavalry , under the government of Hydrabad , to 1095 be permanently maintained in a state of efficiency , but which he ( the resident ) acknowledges the Nizam to be uniformly averse to , lord Cornwallis embraces the first opportunity of explicitly disavowing the conduct of the resident , and instructs him wholly to abandon not only the proposition as to the cavalry , but the whole system of compulsion , or even interference in the civil or military government of the Nizam . The whole letter is replete with censure on the system established by the marquis Wellesley 's government , both as to its justice and policy . I shall not fatigue the house by reading the whole of it ; yet there are two passages so immediately applicable , that I can not refrain from quoting them.— '' The prosecution of such a system of compulsion appears to the governor-general to be inconsistent
