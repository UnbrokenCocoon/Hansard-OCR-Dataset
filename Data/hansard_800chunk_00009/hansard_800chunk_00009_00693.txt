retrieve the national character in the eyes of the natives . The question was then loudly called for , and a division took place . For the first Resolution 20 ; For the previous question 80 ; Majority 60.—Strangers were not readmitted before the adjournment . The previous question was carried upon all the other Resolutions but the last , which was negatived without a division . after referring to the fate of the Offices in Reversion bill , presented a Petition from the lord mayor , aldermen , and common council of the city of London , expressive of their regret , that the bill which had this salutary object in view , should have been defeated , and praying that steps might be taken for carrying into effect a Bill so necessary under the present circumstances of the country . Ordered to lie on the table . reported , from the Committee appointed to try and determine the merits of the Petitions complaining of an undue Election and return for the county of Sussex , that John Fuller , esq . had been duly elected , and that the petitions were not frivolous nor vexatious.—The bill for preventing the grant of Places in Reversion , for a time to be limited , was read a second time . presented to the house , a Petition of the lord mayor , aldermen , and commons of the city of London , in common council assembled , setting forth , `` That the petitioners have , during a long course of public events , productive of so many calamities , patiently submitted to unexampled burthens , and are still ready to make such further sacrifices as may be necessary for maintaining the honour and independence of the realm ; and that these burthens have been considerably augmented by gross abuses in the management and expenditure of , the public money , and by a profusion of sinecure places and pensions , which have not only greatly added to the 1301 sufferings of the people , but created a pernicious and dangerous influence , corrupting and undermining the pure and free principles of the British constitution ; and that after the enormous abuses brought to light by the various Commissions of Enquiry , it is a matter of deep concern to the petitioners that the offenders thereby discovered have not been brought to justice , and those who so grossly misapplied the public money have hitherto escaped with impunity , and the petitioners did therefore rely upon parliament that speedy and effectual measures would have been adopted to reform such abuses , and detect and punish the offenders in future ; and that the petitioners viewed with much satisfaction the formation of a Committee of Finance , and hailed the introduction into the house of a Bill to prevent the granting of places in reversion as the first step towards these salutary reformations ; they beheld with increased satisfaction the measures taken by the house , both during the late and present sessions of parliament , to carry the same into effect ; and that it was with grief and disappointment they observed the views and intentions of the house unhappily frustrated ; and they have too much reason to apprehend that the defeat of this measure has arisen from that baneful and predominating influence which such abuses must necessarily create , and which this Bill was intended to correct ; and that it appears to the petitioners at all times essential that a rigid economy should be observed in the expenditure of the public money , and that no places or pensions should be bestowed but for real public services , more particularly so at the present moment , when it is declared , 'that this country is at the very crisis of its fate , ' and the people are called upon for such unexampled sacrifices and exertions ; they beg further to suggest to the house , the serious consequences likely to result should a disposition be evinced by either branch of the legislature , at a period so awful and momentous , not to participate with the
