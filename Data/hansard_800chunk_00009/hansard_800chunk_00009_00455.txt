the interruption to the trade of belligerents , it falls in some degree into the lap of neutrals . '' He says also , that though a neutral has a right to carry on in time of war his accustomed trade , `` yet he is not to enlarge it by carrying on a trade which he holds by no use or habit in time of peace . '' Subject then , to these exceptions , the commerce of neutral nations stands upon this high and most modern authority in our own country , in the midst of the war with revolutionary France , untouched by the contentions , or particular interests , or conveniences of belligerent powers.—I am ready , however , to admit that this is only the ordinary condition of neutrals , whilst belligerents observe the law of nations towards one another . I admit that a different state of things may arise , concerning which , however , the public law is not silent , but observes the same principles of reason and justice . It is better at once to state the very case which produces the whole controversy , rather than imagine others , the application of which may be disputed.—France issued her decree of the 21st of Nov. 1806 , which 937 ( taking it , for the present , in its severest interpretation , untouched by any subsequent constructions ) , announced a resolution to distress this country in a manner unauthorized by public law ; subjecting to capture the ships and cargoes of neutrals carrying British commodities and manufactures , or going to , or coming from G. Britain , with their accustomed trade . Such a decree undoubtedly announced a rule which the law of nations forbids , as being , even as between belligerents , ( independently of the rights of neutrals ) an aggravation of the sufferings of war which humanity and wise policy equally forbid , and which is , therefore , unauthorised by the practice of civilized states ; such a decree ( if carried into execution ) would invest the belligerent with a right of retaliation ; and , indeed , as between the belligerents only , I am not at all anxious to dispute whether the very publication of such an unjust ordinance would not authorize the belligerent , so offended , to disregard the law of nations towards the adversary as far as it touched him only : but it would be an utter perversion of the very term retaliation , to carry it a hair 's breadth further , until some act was done under the decree , as against a neutral , by which the wrong done to , and suffered by , the neutral , became injurious in its effect to the offended belligerent.—It is , indeed , quite astonishing to hear the word 'retaliation ' twisted and perverted in manner equally repugnant to grammar and common sense . Retaliation , in the strict , and literal , interpretation of the word , from re and talio , as you have it in all your dictionaries , signifies to return like for like . Therefore , but for the particularly of the case , the term retaliation could apply only to the return of like for like upon the enemy who committed the injurious act : by like for like , I do not mean that the act of retaliation , as against the enemy , must be the same as the enemy 's , which would be quibbling with the subject ; because , as against him who injures me , I may return whatever is necessary to repel the injury suffered , and to secure me against its consequences . It was never , therefore , contended , as was lately supposed by a noble lord , that if an enemy violated a neutral territory in the prosecution of his hostility , the other belligerent could only follow him as if he were hunting him upon the scent : certainly not.—There the neutral , from wrong or from weakness , is made the direct instrument of attack ,
