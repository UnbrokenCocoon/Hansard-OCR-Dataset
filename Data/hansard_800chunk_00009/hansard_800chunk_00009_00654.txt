, that there is just ground to apprehend that the exclusion of colonial produce from the continent of Europe , if it could be effected , would close many of those channels of industry , by the means of which the commerce and manufactures of this country have attained an unparalleled degree of prosperity : that it would divert the labour of the continent from the production of those articles for which maritime commerce has hitherto afforded a vent , to the culture of those productions for the supply of which the extinction of such commerce must create an imperious demand.—That it appears to this house , that the manufactures of this country must sustain irreparable injury , from forcibly diverting the labour of America , by the annihilation of maritime commerce , to the manufacture of those articles which habit has made necessary to that country , and the furnish- 1239 ing of which has long given sustenance to thousands of our industrious countrymen.—That this system which his majesty 's Orders in Council are intended to enforce , whether regarded as a source of revenue or as a measure of hostility , appears to this house equally nugatory and absurd : as a source of revenue , its success must depend on the co-operation of the neutral whose property is to be taxed , on the inclination of our allies to sacrifice their interest to our views , and on the consent of our enemies to contribute to the increase of those resources which it is their known object to annihilate : as a measure of warfare , it is destructive of our resources , injurious to the interests of our friends , but wholly ineffectual against our enemies , whom it enables , by payment of the projected duties , to purchase a complete exemption from the distress which it professes to bring upon them.—That it appears to this house , that his majesty 's ministers , by advising his majesty to adopt such a mode of warfare , are co-operating with the government of France to deprive the inhabitants of the respective countries of the comforts to which they are habituated , and even of the means by which they have existed : and that in so doing , they are concurring in an experiment which puts the great contest now at issue betwixt the two nations , on a ground highly disadvantageous to the British empire ; for it is obvious , that this system of deprivation must bear much harder on the people of this country , where property has been uniformly respected , and the profits of industry held sacred , than on the people of France , who have been habituated to the extremes of distress , during the convulsions which the revolution has created . '' denied that the commerce of the country had , previous to the issuing of the Orders in Council , shown that increasing prosperity stated by the noble lord ; on the contrary , the experts , which in 1806 amounted to 27,000,000l . decreased in 1807 to 25,000,000l . The exports of West India and East India produce had also declined in proportion . The Orders in Council had become , therefore , necessary for the maintenance of our own commerce , and their beneficial effects were proved by the increase in our exports from the 5th of Dec. up to the last week : an increase had taken place in the export of sugar , of woollen , cotton , and linen . Our West India colonies , instead of being injured , would be benefited . Their produce 1240 had previously been undersold in the foreign markets by the foreign colonial produce , conveyed by neutrals , and the certificates of origin were devised to prevent British colonial produce from finding a market . Now , however , under the operation of these Orders , the whole of the colonial produce being brought to this country , would be so mixed that it would be impossible for the enemy to distinguish the one from the other , and our own colonial produce would no
