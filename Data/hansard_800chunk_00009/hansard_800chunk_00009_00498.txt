at the time of the signature of the treaty , not only was there no prospect of invasion by the Shah , but all future danger of the kind was removed by his death and the dismemberment of his dominions . 4 . It is to be observed , that the value of the ceded provinces was taken at a reduced and low rate ; that they immediately rose in value , and have regularly been returned as producing more than the revenue at which they were estimated ; so that on their own shewing the Bengal government have extorted more than , on their own principle , they had any right to demand . 5 . It should not be omitted that , during the whole of the negotiations recorded in the Oude Papers , not only the utmost hauteur was constantly employed towards the nabob , but , at various times , demands of the most unjust and exorbitant 1000 nature were made on him ; at one time the expences of an embassy to Persia ; at another , demands for payment of troops ; the data on which such demands were made , being avowedly false ; the different corps being calculated as complete , though they were acknowledged not to be so ; and the presence of the corps themselves being extremely doubtful . 6 . There is another proceeding which makes a great figure in these papers , but which , as it does not finally affect the termination of the business , I have not insisted on.—I mean the negotiation set on foot in consequence of a proposal of the nabob to abdicate ; of which I shall only say , that the conduct of lord W. on that occasion , seems to me altogether such as would have justified any jealousy of his interference , and suspicions of his motives , which the nabob might subsequently appear to have entertained . `` — After urging all these points at considerable length , lord Folkestone concluded by exhorting the house to banish from their minds all feelings of affection and partiality , and do justice between the parties whoever they might be ; and moved the First of the following 12 Resolutions : viz . `` That it appears to this house , that on or about the 21st of Feb. 1798 , the nabob , Saadut Ali , ascended the musnud of the province of Oude ; and that he then entered into a treaty with the East India Company , whereby it was agreed , that the said Company should defend his territory against all enemies whatsoever , and for this purpose should constantly keep up , in the province , a force of not less than 10,000 , nor more than 18,000 men ; in return for which defence , the said Company was to receive from him an annual subsidy of 76 lacks of rupees , paid by monthly kists , ( or instalments ) : that in case the defence of the country should at any time demand a greater number of the Company 's forces than 18,000 men , the nabob should defray the expence of the difference ; that , in case the monthly kists should fall in arrear , the nabob should undertake then to give security for the future payment of the same ; that the said nabob should maintain correspondence with no foreign state , unless with the knowledge and consent of the Company : but that he was to be allowed to 'possess full authority over his household affairs , hereditary dominions , his troops , and his subjects . '' `` That it appears that the nabob 's 1001 forces were composed of disorderly troops , unaccustomed to the rules of good discipline , and disaffected to his person ; —that the nabob himself was extremely desirous to remedy the defects of their constitution , and to bring them into good order ; —that , for that purpose , he made frequent applications to the government of Bengal , through the resident at Lucknow , for advice and assistance in forwarding
