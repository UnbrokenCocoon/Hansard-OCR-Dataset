, and the faith reposed in their administration . But when the question is thus brought to a precise legal issue , in which ministers and their predecessors are not the contending parties : but where the rights of the whole British empire , and of all nations , are to be settled by parliament , every man , I should think , must admit how inadmissible , or rather how perfectly frivolous , such an argument must be . If , for instance , the question were , what punishment I , who have the honour of addressing your lordships , should receive from a court of justice , whose judgment was discretionary , for an offence against the law , of which I had been convicted , every topic would undoubtedly be relevant to shew that my mind was innocent , and that I had offended from ignorance of my duty : but if the 931 question only were , whether the law had or had not been broken , would it be relevant that I had taken the advice of the ablest counsel , who had misled me , or that I had even relied upon a judicial decision , which had afterwards been determined to be erroneous ? I must therefore earnestly entreat your lordships to entertain the question like statesmen , in a case where the interests of your country and of the world are so deeply involved in the decision . If the Resolutions , which I am about to submit to your lordships , are unfounded or erroneous , I shall most humbly and sincerely defer to the judgment of the house which rejects them ; but if , as formerly , you fly altogether from the question , I shall then say , and the world will say with me , that no answer could be given to them.—I should enter upon the subject , my lords , with no satisfaction , if I believed the evils of these Orders in Council to be irretrievable . I hope it is not my temper to be malignant ; I think , indeed , that if I were accused before your lordships of any act , which could only be ascribed to such a base and unworthy disposition , you would not very willingly condemn me . What satisfaction could I have in merely making out , that several noble persons had involved their country in difficulties that were irrecoverable ? What satisfaction could I have in wounding and alienating the minds of those , whom upon other accounts I esteem , and whose regard I must wish to cultivate in private life ? My lords , I disavow most solemnly any such motive or purpose : I am convinced that it is not too late to retrace the false steps that have been taken ; and if it can he shown , by any proceeding directed to such object , that the late ministers have also violated the law of nations , do not let the one breach of them be justified by the other : speaking for all my colleagues who surround me , as well as for myself , I say , if that case can be established , we must retrace our steps together . Let us concur , my lords , in serving—serving do I say ! let us concur in saving our country.—My lords , the two first Resolutions , which I shall now read , I may assume without detaining the house by any argument upon the subject , because my noble and learned friend upon the woolsack distinctly disclaimed on a former occasion ( I was quite sure that he would ) , all intention of arguing for any power in the crown , to suspend or dispense with the laws , or of justifying , upon 932 any such principle , the advice of the privy council , by which the Orders complained of were issued.—This we had not forgotten , when the two Resolutions were first drawn up ; but it was thought necessary , nevertheless , that they should stand upon the paper
