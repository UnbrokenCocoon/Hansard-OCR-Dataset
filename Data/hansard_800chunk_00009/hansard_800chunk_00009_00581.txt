'Although there is no prospect of any attack on your excellency 's territory at present , its security must ultimately depend upon the strength of the force stationed for its protection . I doubt not your excellency will agree to the additional expense of effective troops , where the object is the defence of the country ; for this reason I do not hesitate to recommend to your excellency , to discharge so much of your own army as will allow for the additional expence attending the continuance of those effective troops . It is my firm intention , not to embarrass your excellency , with further expense than that incurred by the company from their connection with your excellency , and for the protection of your country ; which , by the accounts , I find amounts to 50,00,000 annually . ' Thus , lord Cornwallis superseded an article of a former treaty , augmenting the British force in Oude , and requiring the vizier to discharge so much of his own army as would enable him to pay the expense of our effective troops . In respect to the details of his highness 's government , lord Cornwallis remarked , 'As it is the intention of the company , and my firm resolution , that no interference shall take place in the details of the affairs of your excellency 's government , strict orders shall be sent to him [ the resident ] , that he shall neither interfere himself , nor suffer interference , by , public or private claims , or exemptions of duties , or in any other mode , from any British subject , or person under the authority of this government ; in short , leaving the whole management of your country to your excellency and your ministers I will put a stop to the interference 'of others : and , in order to carry this 'effectually into execution , I propose to your excellency not to suffer any Europeas to reside in your dominions without my written permission . '—Notwithstanding the nature of the interference 1127 which lord Cornwallis was determined to prevent , was thus specifically expressed to be the interference of Europeans residing in Oude , whether with or without authority , yet it had been contended that these expressions were sufficient to restrain any future governor-general from interposing the power of the company for the security of the province , by augmenting the number of the British troops , and by insisting on the discharge of the nabob 's mutinous rabble . The conduct of lord Cornwallis , as shewn in the same letter , completely falsified this construction ; for the house would explicitly understand it to be his firm determination , that , 'the expence incurred by the company from their con- nection with Oude , and for the protection of the country , ' should be defrayed by the nabob . The interference he deprecated was , that of lawless Europeans , who had , for their corrupt purposes , been too long engaged in pursuing usurious loans , in insisting upon exemptions from duties upon their merchandise , and in oppressing the inhabitants , by enforcing the payment of balances , on the equity of which such offenders had themselves decided.—The result of lord Cornwallis 's treaty was , therefore , in practice this : —That he augmented the British troops as he thought necessary for the protection of Oude , 'although there was no prospect of attack on his excellency 's territory ; ' and made the vizier pay for that augmentation : that he called upon the nabob to discharge his useless troops : and , though he very properly interdicted all interference in the details of the vizier 's government by Europeans resident at Oude , he not only did not relinquish any of the sovereign rights derived from his predecessors , and confirmed by treaty , but even extended the interposition of his power to the protection of the vizier 's minister , in opposition to the will of his master . And upon this marked act of interference , in
