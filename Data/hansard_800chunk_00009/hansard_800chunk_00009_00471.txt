vested somewhere , and in parliament it is vested : this is the true answer , and it leads directly to the only remaining consideration , viz . Whether , supposing the jurisdiction contended for to have been once a branch of the prerogative , it has not been taken away by the ancient statutes of the realm.—This subject , my lords , is highly interesting , and the result will be found most honourable to our 960 country , because it will be seen that whilst other nations were only emerging from barbarism , and before they had settled under that politic and moral dominion which long usage has since established in Europe ; yet that England , even then—England , which has ever been the morning star , ( may God avert her ever appearing as the star of the evening to mark the setting of civilized nations ! ) England , which seems to have been planted on the skirts of the world to shew the light to every part of it , and planted upon a tower to be seen like other lights from a distance , and to be secure from violence , England embodied into her own laws the rights and privileges of other nations , well earning the enlightened praise which the president Montesquieu has bestowed upon her.—Our wise and prudent ancestors saw , even in the very infancy of commerce , the principles upon which alone it could prosper ; and , knowing that it can no more live under the sceptre of power than the natural world can exist without the free circulation or the atmosphere which surrounds it , they guarded it even against the prerogatives wisely entrusted to her sovereigns , and placed it in the states of the kingdom representing the whole people whose interests depended upon its security.—Let it not be thought , my lords , that by thus contrasting the king 's power with the authority of parliament , I seek to abridge the just prerogatives of the crown , or , by an unworthy jealousy , to degrade the king 's high dignity and character in the state : I seek , on the contrary to exalt them . It is by mistakingly bringing forward the king as an adverse party , and by ascribing to him the motives which govern individual men , that his sovereignty is tarnished . To those who misunderstand our constitution it appears to be a startling proposition that the king can do no wrong , ' but to those who do understand it , the maxim is plain and simple ; for he can certainly do no wrong who in fact , can do nothing ; the constitution knows nothing of the king , as an individual , so as to estimate his individual actions : he is known only as the head of all the national councils ; his office is not merely executive or passively legislative ; no , he presides every where : the laws are made by the king in his parliament , and they are the king 's laws when made . They are administered by the king in all his courts , which are then his council ; for lord Coke says , in his third 961 Institute that the king 's council is 'secundum subjectam wateriam ; and , therefore , when it was sad , in a statute of Richard ii . that offenders were to be brought before the king and his council , to answer for offences against the act , it was held by all the judges that the subject matter being legal , the courts of law were intended as his council . For other matters , his majesty has , in like manner , a variety of councils : the privy council , for high matters of state , and inferior councils upon subjects ecclesiastical , military , or naval . In all of them the king is for ever present , supreme , and predominant , and he can have no guide but the constitution , nor any personal interest by what councils he shall
