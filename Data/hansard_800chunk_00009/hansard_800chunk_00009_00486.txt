. 's measure had been passed two years ago , and had been in operation twenty months ; and when the returns should be examined , it would be found distinct from every other in this respect , that it made no addition to 982 the prior strength of the army . From the year 1803 , to the present time , the army had been , year after year , progressively increased from 232,000 men to 291,000 , exclusive of 10,000 which were wanting to complete the militia , and which would be furnished in the course of the next month . In this progressive increase , the right hon . gent . 's administration had added but 6 or 7,000 men , which were derived from the Additional Force act , and therefore not to be attributed to the right hon . gent . 's measure . The regular disposable force was , in 1804 , in number 141,000 , and in 1808 it was 204,000 ; of which the right hon . gent . could claim credit only for the before mentioned 6000 , derived from the Additional Force act . In the 18 months preceding the commencement of the operation of the right hon . gent . 's measure , 30,748 men were raised . In the 18 months during which that measure had been 26,040 being a diminution of 4,000 . In point of comparative value it was to be considered , that of the preceding number 17,000 entered at once for unlimited service , and the remaining 14,000 , though entering at first for limited service , afterwards extended their engagements without limitation . He repeated , that he was of opinion the principle of limited service ought always to make part of our military code ; and he was satisfied , that without it , the numbers of our army could not be kept up . But let it be seriously considered , what would be the consequence of making it the exclusive principle . With no less than 90,000 men now employed in foreign and colonial service , how would it be possible to maintain an efficient army in our distant possessions , if it would be necessary to bring home the men at the termination of a short period of service . Every soldier sent to India cost 100l . for his conveyance out and home ; and if a regiment was to be sent out , the whole , or the greater part of which would be to be brought back at the end of 3 years ; he begged the house to consider how little service would be had for so enormous an expence . He allowed , that a limited engagement might answer very well for European service . But all he wished was , a fair option to the individual to form his engagement , so that some portion of our army , and that as large a portion as might be , should consist of men engaged for life . Let it be considered how large a portion of our army was already engaged for limited service 983 only ; and here he could not help expressing his satisfaction , that it was not now the object of consideration how an army was to be raised , but how a very flourishing army already in existence should be maintained . The present regular army of the line consisted of 204,000 men , and he was sorry to say , that of these , including the men enlisted under the right hon . gent . 's measure , full 70,000 were engaged for limited service . The number raised under the right hon . gent . 's measure was 26,000 , and they were all for limited service . All the foreign corps were , from their origin , engaged for limited service ; the garrison battalions were also limited ; and the volunteers from the militia , with the exception of 6 or 7,000 . It was matter of very serious consideration , to think that the 36,000 enlisted this year would all be entitled to
