this object , and in default of their co-operation , did himself adopt such measures as in a short time reduced his different regular battalions to half their complement ofmen . ' '' — '' That it appears that the nabob was scrupulously punctual and regular in the discharge of the monthly kists ( or instalments ) of the subsidy ; and that 'whilst he was determined to fulfil with minute regularity the peculiar engagements with the company , his views were directed to the enjoyment of a full authority over his houshold affairs , hereditary dominions , and subjects , according to the most strict interpretation of the clause of the 17th Article of the Treaty executed at Lucknow . ' '' — '' That it appears that notwithstanding this good disposition of the nabob , the marquis Wellesley , soon after his arrival in Bengal , formed a plan for 'the total reduction of the troops of the nabob , with the exception of such part as might be necessary for the purposes of state , or the collection of revenue ; ' and , on or about the 5th of Nov. 1799 , proceeded to take steps for putting the same into execution ; —that , for that express purpose , he ordered troops to march into the territories of the nabob , and to take possession of particular posts in the same ; and that he persisted in this measure , though it was not even insinuated that any danger from foreign invasion existed at the time ; and , though 'the late defeat of the pretended Gholaum Hadier had considerably weakened the pretexts which his as sembled numbers and first success afforded ; ' in opposition to the remonstrances and wishes of the nabob , and in direct violation of the spirit and stipulations of the treaty . '' — '' That it appears , that the said troops were so marched into the province of Oude , under the belief that the funds of the nabob being insufficient to defray this additional charge , he would be thereby compelled to disband his own troops ; —that accordingly , about the 18th of Dec. 1799 , the nabob having vainly attempted 1002 by intreaties and remonstrances to prevent the measure , did at length give a reluctant consent to the dismissal of his battalions ; and on the 20th of Feb. 1800 , issued orders to that effect ; —that from that time , so far from creating obstacles or throwing difficulties in the way of their dismissal , he 'readily adopted every proposition ' made by the resident for that purpose ; so that by the month of Dec. 1800 , twenty-three regular battalions and upwards of 1,200 horsemen had been discharged . '' — '' That it appears , that on or about the 22nd of Jan. 1801 , the marquis Wellesley proposed to 'interfere more actively and decidedly in the affairs of the province of Oude ; ' and that he accordingly directed the British resident at Lucknow , to offer to the nabob two propositions , either , first , 'to transfer to the company the exclusive management of the civil and military government of the country ; '—or , 2ndly , 'to cede to the company in perpetual sovereignty , such a portion of territory as should be fully adequate , in its impoverished condition , to defray the amount of the subsidy to the full extent of the augmented force . ' '' — '' That it appears , that the nabob positively and repeatedly rejected both these proposals ; but that he was finally compelled , by threats and menances , to yield a portion of territory of the alledged annual income of one crore and 35 lacks of rupees , in the terms of the second proposition ; and furthermore , to bind himself to establish in his remaining dominions , a system of police under the advice and controul of the company 's officers , and in all affairs to submit to the opinion of the British resident .
