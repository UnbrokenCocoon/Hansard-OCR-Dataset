But I am astonished that any man in this house , or in any other , should doubt the reality of that danger , when he : recollects , that in confirmation of all the other evidence I have stated , the Prince of Portugal has been driven from his dominions , because he would not join in that confederacy with France , Russia , and Denmark . With this impression , sir , of the conduct of ministers , I am thankful to them for the great service they have rendered to the state , and they may be assured that this feeling is general throughout the country .
