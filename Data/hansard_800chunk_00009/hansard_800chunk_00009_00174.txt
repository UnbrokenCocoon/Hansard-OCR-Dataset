the learned lord ( Erskine ) he felt no inclination to enter into the discussion of the law of nations , as connected with this question . He would however observe , that he thought the reasoning inconclusive , which attempted to bring the seizure of the Danish Fleet within the principle of self-preservation . The idea of a northern confederacy , combining all the naval force of the Baltic , had indeed been held out to alarm the country , and to swell the danger which the measures that had been adopted were intended to avert ; whilst the real fact was , as it would appear upon a close view of the case , that of this supposed combination of naval force , Sweden was with us , the Baltic fleet belonging to Russia completely in our power , and therefore the Danish fleet ( even if at the disposal of France , which at least was questionable , ) the only danger against which we had to provide ; and this , his majesty 's ministers would represent to the country to be so imminent , as to justify measures which , but for the French revolution , would be without precedent , and which his lordship said , he could never admit to be of a magnitude to warrant the application of the principle of self-defence , as laid down by any author upon the law of nations.—Without inquiry into the particulars of the secret arrangements entered into at Tilsit , war with Russia became probable from the moment that treaty was concluded ; and the strong apprehension it excited in the minds of his 362 majesty 's ministers of a northern confederacy , at the head of which the emperor of Russia had agreed to place himself , rendered it their duty to take precautionary measures against that power . It had been said however , that the Russian people were friendly to this country , and that an attack upon Cronstadt would have had an injurious effect upon their feelings ; and this was an argument brought forward by those who could resolve to attack the unoffending Danes , and `` inflict all the horrors of a besieged and bombarded capital upon the innocent inhabitants . '' But even supposing that it was not advisable to meddle with the few hulks left at Cronstadt ( and it had been stated by high official authority that there was nothing else there ) , why , under the circumstances of danger , upon which alone our conduct was defended , were the Russian ships of war that passed through our fleet in the Baltic , and the Russian squadron in the Mediterranean , suffered to escape ? By taking possession of the latter , we should have facilitated the negotiation then depending with the Turks ; and with such an instrument in our hands , we might safely have trusted to the mediation of the court of Petersburg ; whilst at the same time , by a strong naval force in the Baltic , we should have protected Sweden , have enabled Denmark to maintain her neutrality , kept open the Sound , and thus effectually have disappointed the expectations Buonaparte had formed from the influence he had acquired over the emperor of Russia . By such a course , we should have commanded the respect , instead of drawing upon us the enmity , of all Europe . But above all , we should have avoided the abandonment of those sacred principles of justice and honour , by which the conduct of our government had been so advantageously contrasted with that of France ; we should have kept alive that hope , which , under all the pressure of the times , had animated and encouraged a large proportion of the community of this country ; —that the atrocious and profligate principles of the French government must lead to its destruction , and that to whatever difficulties and dangers we might be exposed , by the vicissitudes of war , the hand of Providence would ultimately be stretched forth for the protection and security of
