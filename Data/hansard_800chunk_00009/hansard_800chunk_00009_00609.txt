The principle on which it had been opposed went to this length , that we ought to turn our artillery from the enemy , for a bullet was at least as fatal as a dysentery . We had a right to use every means by which the government of a hostile country might be induced to conclude a reasonable peace . said , that the principle of the bill met with his most severe reprobation .
