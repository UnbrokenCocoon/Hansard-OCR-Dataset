to pay him the sincerest homage , the homage of imitation.—Would to heaven , sir , such being their choice , that they knew better what in him to select for their example ; but imitators in general are blundering plagiarists , and copy rather the defects than the excellencies of their original.—With such a sensibility to the beauties of his crimes , I wish that they joined some respect for his prudence and sagacity.—Sir , this is a most frightful effect of the successes of the French , that they have subdued the minds as well as the bodies of their adversaries.—Is there something in his faults more congenial to their taste or more level to their talents ? But , the translation they publish of Buonaparte 's works , is a brown paper edition.—Sir , there are not wanting those , and they are no inconsiderable persons in this country , who see with pleasure both in India and in Europe , the recent appearances of Englishmen having adopted the principles and assimilated to the character of France.—To such , sir , who think that security for England is to be sought in destroying , the peace of other countries , that the nation ought to distrust its past experience ; ought to be weary of its ancient character , and in short , sir , who think with the Declaration , 'That his majesty has too long carried on a most unequal contest with unrelenting violence and oppression ; that it is right , that the effects of such a system should be anticipated . That it is time that the effects of that 1212 dread , which France has inspired , should be counteracted . by a similar exertion on the part of Great Britain .

Too much regard for the value of public character—too much knowledge of the value of our trade and manufactures—too much affection to our inestimable constitution—might disable them from carrying these needful violations into full and sufficient effect.—And indeed , sir , if , as I believe , the noble and honourable persons who were recently dismissed from their stations , understand their own interests as well as they do those of their country , and if they feel for their own honour as acutely as I think they do , they will be contented , they will rejoice , that they are not called upon to save the state by shedding innocent blood , and by violating time laws of nations and the laws of the land . They will be satisfied with the barren unprofitable duty of defending the great maxims of both , and leave to others the disreputable and mischievous task of establishing the exceptions.—Sir , I hope these honourable persons will continue their meritorious exertions , however small the numbers may be that support them in this house.—With such a case as theirs , they can not fail of success , if they do but persist . Perseverance in a doubtful purpose .makes a doubtful purpose respectable , perseverance in a good purpose makes a good cause irresistible . For my part , sir , although for the sake Of the house and of the country , I could ardently wish that many may be found to reprobate the expedition to Copenhagen , yet I shall be little dejected , and not at all disappointed however small the number that is found to concur with me . Besides the duty which a public man owes to his country , he owes something
