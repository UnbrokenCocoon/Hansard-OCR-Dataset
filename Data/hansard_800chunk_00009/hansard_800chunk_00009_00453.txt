issue new Orders , which were styled Supplemental , but which were manifestly repugnant and inconsistent : these were afterwards illustrated by explanations , which , in their turn , required explanation ; and when parliament was , at last , permitted to assemble , after so many public marks of rashness and precipitation , ministers have been obliged , day after day , to abandon some of the most essential parts a their system , after they had but too probably increased the irritation which they were at that very moment endeavouring , by public embassy , to compose.—My lords , if parliament had been assembled , how different might have been our present situation . Ministers would then have had only to propose their system , without being committed to it , and , Perhaps , fatally committed to other nations . The most eminent merchants would then have furnished independent lights to the committees of parliament , and the Councils of the country would then have been governed by the public results of 934 those communications , instead of depending , as I fear they have , upon the flatteries and deceptions of the interested and the ignorant.—But , my lords , the worst is still behind . Ministers , instead of asking indemnity for these illegal acts , upon the footing of their necessity and justice , make them the foundation of an act of parliament , which we may expect soon to be called upon to consent to . For my own part , my lords , I would rather cast into the fire the patent which entitles me to sit among your lordships , than give my consent to any statute , even though I approved of its provisions , if I saw upon the face of it a distinct assumption of the dispensing power of the crown , not even assumed to be justified under the necessity of the case , but recited on the face of the act as a legal proceeding , requiring only the aid of parliament to give effect to additional enactments of revenue . If this should grow up into a practice , what have we gained by the revolution ? No man , my lords , can be a greater enthusiast than I am upon every thing connected with that glorious æra , nor more attached to the establishment of his majesty 's illustrious family , which stands for its support upon the principles which placed it on the throne ; an attachment which I feel the stronger , from an affection for their persons ; ( for the illustrious person , among the rest , who sits so very near me ) . But , my lords , I had much rather that king William had never set his foot in England , than that the dispensing and suspending powers should lose all their former terrors , and that ministers should be permitted to trample upon the laws at their pleasure , without even the shadow of public necessity , without even the trouble of considering whether they were breaking them or no ; and that it should become a mere matter of course , without even the forum of an indemnity , to recite their usurpations upon the face of our statutes , eking out their measures , through the forms of parliament , just at any point they may chooser in their moderation , to stop at , in their fearless encroachments on the constitution . My lords , I would rather have an arbitrary king , with a jealous and a free parliament , than see such an habitual departure from all the securities which have characterised for ages the government of our country.—My lords , I will now read the third Resolution , which brings us to the great subject of deliberation.— '' That the law of nations is a part of the law of 935 the land , and that neutral nations , not interposing in the war between his majesty and his enemies , have a legal right to such freedom of commerce and navigation , as is secured to
