events without using , however unwillingly , the expressions of warmth and of resentment : but , sir , this is the fault of the case , and not the fault of the 1210 speaker , of those who have been guilty of the transaction , and not of the transaction , and not of those who describe it.—I know not what the felling of indignation was given us for , if it is not to be excited and justified by such a proceeding . It is not our fault , if the circumstances are such as to give to the plainest narration the colours of the severest invective , and if the unexaggerated facts can not be stated without the use of words suggested by the feelings necessarily associated with such events . I am aware , sir , that to suit the temper of a majority of gentlemen here , it would have been prudent to subdue one 's best emotions , and to dilute their natural expressions . It was once said by a man of rank and influence , which he had employed to the unspeakable mischief of his country , that he had derived considerable advantage from the nature of his actions being such , as to render an honest adversary averse even to the mention of them . There is some such sad and profligate advantage , arising to the perpetrators of the Violence at Copenhagen , that their conduct can not be spoken of properly but in a tone and manner not approved in parliament , which has such an aversion to , what is called declamation and vehemence , that it will scarcely endure them , even when the language they use , is the only language suited to the occasion . Sir , I allow that gentleness , civility , and self-restraint are no small virtues , but on such an occasion as this , there is one thing fairly worth them all , and that is—truth . In the little transitory controversies of wrangling parties , let the former appear and please , but here , sir , on this occasion , let no man be blamed for the only terms that correspond with the subject . If the attack we speak of was not unavoidable , it is impossible to exaggerate either the guilt or the folly . What is meant by candour , and mildness , and moderation , is indeed sometimes of great use in public affairs , and never of more , than when they shelter the errors of ministers from ridicule , and their criminality front detection.—They are , sir , however , not the excellencies of all times and of all seasons ; in some they are a want of courage , in others they are want of integrity . The recent violation of public law at Copenhagen , the sudden overthrow of all our commercial policy , the breach of some of our most important and most constitutional statutes , by the rash and ignorant Orders in Council , are all the ill-favoured Consequence of an alarm- 1211 ing change in our principles of public faith , and of public maxims.— We have heard enough , and perhaps more than was honestly meant of the dangers of innovation , hut no innovation can equal the late innovations of the men who are in power.—It is perhaps the . greatest evil of the French resolution , that it has let loose a mischievous spirit of scepticism , tempting us to distrust all the maxims of right and wrong that have hitherto kept the world from having more resemblance to a place of torment , than a state of probation.—England , not England—We are invaded—conquered—French principles have invaded us—we are conquered in our hearts.—From the choice of those whose principles and conduct ministers have lately told us that they study in order . to avoid them ; from the selection of him whom they purpose to imitate ; it is easy to infer what will be the future characteristics of their administration.—They have learned , sir , not only to admire the enemy , but
