nor any design on the part of the former to depart from the strictest neutrality ; on the contrary , the above-mentioned solemn declaration of the Crown Prince to the British minister ought to have been received by his majesty 's servants as 35 the pledge of a firm resolution to maintain neutrality ; and because nothing Short of a hostile design in the government of Denmark could justify the demand of her fleet , or the bombardment of Copenhagen , to enforce the surrender of it.—Because , It was completely in the power of G. Britain to have protected the Danish fleet from any hostile attack of France , which destroys the pretence of such an indispensable necessity as could alone justify even the slightest trespass upon a peaceable and unoffending state.—Because , Still assuming , in the absence of all evidence to the contrary , that the government of Denmark was faithful to her neutrality , no speculation of the probable fall of her fleet into the possession or power of France , could possibly justify its hostile seizure by G. Britain . Such a principle would be utterly subversive of the first elements of public law , as being destructive of the independence of weaker states , inasmuch as it would create a jurisdiction in the stronger nations to substitute their own security and convenience for the general rule , and invest them also with the sole privilege of determining the occasions upon which they might consider them to be endangered ; and because to justify the attack and plunder of a weak unoffending power , upon the assumption that a stronger belligerent might otherwise attack and plunder her , would be to erect a new public law upon the foundations of dishonour and violence , making the tyranny of one nation a warrant for substituting the dominion of oppression for the sacred obligations of morality , humanity , and justice.—Because , supposing it to have been not only probable , but even certain , that France could have succeeded in carrying away in the winter the ships and stores from Copenhagen , but without the consent of Denmark , faithful to her neutrality , the iniquity of that act , in sound policy , independently of all considerations of justice , ought to have been left to the French Government to perpetrate ; because the carcases of the ships would have been the only fruit of an act of the deepest atrocity , whilst the indignation of a brave and generous people , now too justly directed against G. Britain , would then have been pointed against France ; and Denmark , with the protection of our fleets , might have kept open the Baltic to our commerce , and extended our maritime means of restoring the tranquillity of the world.—Because , Until this attack upon Copenhagen shall 36 receive vindication by proof of its justice , or condemnation , in the absence of it , from the parliament of G. Britain , she has lost her moral station in the world , since the very system of wrong and violence , which she has so long confederated Europe to destroy , at the expence of her blood and resources , will have been established and confirmed by her own example.—Because , A whole nation ought not in the mean time to be dishonoured , nor its immemorial characteristic brought into question for the acts of ministers ; and because it is the duty of those subjects , who , by the constitution of the government , have the high privilege of perpetuating . their sentiments upon the public records of their country , to vindicate themselves from the imputation of having acquiesced in acts of the greatest injustice . `` ERSKINE . '' The Speaker acquainted the house that that house had been in the house of peers , where the lord chancellor , one of the lords authorized by his majesty 's commission , had read a most gracious speech from his majesty , of which , to prevent mistakes , he hall obtained a copy.—He then proceeded to read the Speech from the
