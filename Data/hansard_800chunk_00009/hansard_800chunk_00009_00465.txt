. In pursuing this course , I shall begin with the decisions of the common law judges , who are frequently brought to the consideration of this subject , in the cases of policies of insurance.—Your lordships no doubt know that when a ship is warranted neutral , it is not enough that she should have been built in the neutral state , or should be the property of , or navigated by , her subjects , but that she must also be navigated according to the law of nations , so as to emancipate her from just capture , and thereby secure to the underwriter the protection of the neutral flag ; otherwise , the warranty being broken , he is discharged front the risk . This principle has brought many cases before the courts , when particular governments have taken upon them to make ordinances and regulations contrary to the law of nations , and without the consent of other states . If this could be legally done by any particular state , our courts here would be bound to respect such ordinances as engrafted on the law of nations ; but the most solemn decisions run uniformly to the contrary . If a Court of Admiralty , indeed , condemns in general terms , pronouncing against the neutrality , the question can not arise , because full faith must be given to the acts of courts of competent jurisdiction ; but if ( as very frequently has been the case ) they condemn for the breach of an ordinance or regulation made by a particular state , not supported by the general law of nations , the courts uniformly pronounce such ordinances to be absolutely void.—My lords , the cases are many in number , and I might cite them from memory , having been concerned as counsel in all of them , for more than the last 20 years , but I will content myself with a few which are directly in point , and when the most eminent judges have presided in our courts.—In the case of Mayne against Walter , where a ship , warranted Portuguese , was condemned in France , because she had an English supercargo on board , contrary to a French ordinance , it was held that the sentence did not falsify the warranty . Lord Mansfield saying , that 'it was an arbitrary , and oppressive regulation , contrary to the law 952 of nations ; ' and in a subsequent case , though the question was shut out by the generality of the sentence , lord Mansfield said , `` The law of nations is founded in eternal principles of justice ; but belligerent powers frequently make regulations for themselves , which , being no part of , or , perhaps repugnant to , the law of nations , do not bind other states . '—But the subsequent casts of Pollard and Bell , and Bird and Appleton , are so absolutely decisive , that they may finish your lordships trouble upon this part of the subject . In the first of these cases , a ship , being warranted Danish , was captured by the French , and condemned as prize , because the captain was an enemy ; so expressed on the face of the sentence . The court were unanimously of opinion , that it did not falsify the warranty . Lord Kenyon said , 'this is one of the numerous questions that have arisen in consequence of the extraordinary sentences of condemnation passed by the Courts of Admiralty in France during this war , which have proceeded in a system of plunder ; but still , until the legislature interferes , we , sitting here in a court of law , must give credit to the sentences of courts of competent jurisdiction . If , therefore , in this instance , the French courts had condemned on the grounds that she was not Danish property , we should have been concluded , and must , reluctantly , have declded : but I concur with lord Mansfield in opinion , that it is not competent
