interrupt the commerce of friendly and unoffending nations , carrying on their accustomed trade in innocent articles , between their own country and the ports of his majesty 's enemies , not actually blockaded ; and even between their own country and those of his majesty 's allies . And also , inasmuch as they purport to compel such trade in 970 future , to come , in the first instance , under pain of confiscation , to the ports of his majesty 's dominions , or of his allies , and there to submit to such regulations , restrictions and duties as shall be imposed upon them.—5th , That by the Law of Nations , all independent governments have an undoubted right , both in war and peace , to regulate in their own territories , and according to their own convenience , except where specially restrained by treaty , the admission or exclusion of the ships or merchandize of other states . That by the municipal law of this and other European countries , it bath been usual to require , that vessels trading to or from the ports thereof , shall carry such certificates or other documents , spewing in what country the vessel bath been built , fitted or owned , by what sailors she is navigated , and in what country the articles composing the cargo have been grown , produced or manufactured , as may be judged necessary to entitle them to entry . And , that the ships of friendly nations carrying such papers in time of war , do not thereby violate any rule of amity with other countries , or legally incur any penalty whatever , unless such should be found to be fraudulent.—6th , That so much of his majesty 's Order in Council , of the 11th of Nov. last , as directs , that 'any vessels carrying any certificates or documents , declaring , that the articles of the cargo are not of the produce or manufacture of his majesty 's dominions , or to that effect , or carrying any other document referring to such certificate or document , shall , together with the goods laden therein , belonging to the persons by whom , or on whose behalf , any such document was put on board , be adjudged lawful prize to the captor ; ' is a gross and flagrant violation of the Law of Nations , of the statutes made for the freedom of navigation and commerce , and of the rights and liberties of the people of this realm ; inasmuch as it purports to expose the property both of foreign merchants , and even of his majesty 's subjects , in the ports of this realm , as well as on the high seas , to unjust detention and forfeiture in cases where no offence whatever hath been committed against any known principle , or rule of the Law of Nations , or against any law , statute , or usage of the realm.—7th , That the free access to the ports of this realm , and the liberty of trading to and from the same , has been secured to merchant strangers , not being of a hostile nation , by 971 Magna Charta and divers other ancient statutes in which it is expressly provided , 'that no manner of ship , which is fraught towards England or elsewhere , be compelled to come to any port of England , nor there to abide , against the will of the masters and mariners of the same , or of the merchants whose the goods be .
