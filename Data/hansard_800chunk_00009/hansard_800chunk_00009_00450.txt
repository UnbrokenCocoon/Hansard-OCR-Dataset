, ( I speak most advisedly when I say it , ) —they involve no less a question , than the very existence of that whole system of conventional public law , which has contributed so much to advance the civilization , and to secure the happiness of the world . They involve no less a question , than whether the tyranny of revolutionary France shall terminate its destructive career in the temporary sufferings of the nations now subject to its dominion ; whether it shall exhaust its force upon the persons and properties of the present generation in the temporary exactions of conquest ; or , whether that dominion shall extend itself over the human mind in all countries and in all ages ; whether it shall repeal and trample in the dust all the sanctions of morals and policy , which the wisdom of ages has ripened into universal law , for universal security and peace.—G . Britain alone can answer this question for the world : she alone can pronounce , whether the injustice of France shall be received as a warrant for universal injustice , or whether , standing as we do , upon this proud eminence , surrounded by that impregnable moat with which the Divine Providence has fortified this island , we can say , as the instrument of that providence , to the portentuous evils which so remarkably characterize this unexampled period , 'Thus far shall ye advance , and no farther.—My lords , although this momentuous subject has been repeatedly , and in various shapes , presented for your consideration , I am sorry to be obliged to observe , that it has not as yet been received by his majesty 's ministers in such a manner , as either the house or the public , but , above all , as other nations , had a right to expect from a British parliament . The breach of the law of nations by ministers has been put aside by irrelevant recriminations upon supposed breaches of the same law by others ; and the facts , from the establishment of which the legal argument could alone be brought to a 930 decision , have been put aside by the previous question.—It has therefore been thought right to prepare the Resolutions , which I am presently to propose to you , and to frame them in such a manner as to embrace the whole subject : they therefore declare the right of neutral nations to the commerce secured to them by the general law of the civilized world , and by the particular laws and statutes of this realm ; they deny the legality of the Order in Council of the 11th of Nov. and the others dependent upon it , as being a gross violation of both , and they maintain these propositions , not in loose and general terms , so as to lead again to the shelter of a desultory debate , but , in language most technically precise , they point out the law as it exists , and mark all the departures front it which they condemn.—When the matter is therefore brought to this direct issue—i . e. whether the late Orders in Council are justified by , or contrary to , the law of nations , and the law of the land , and when , as a peer of the realm , I arraign them in this great public council as a violation of both , can it possibly be any answer to such charges , that a former administration of the king 's government was guilty of a similar violation ? Can we , sitting here as statesmen representing the whole British people , so abuse their interests and insult their feelings in such distressing and perilous times ? —If , indeed , the breach of the law had been established or admitted , and the question before us were the degree of blame imputable to ministers for having so mistaken the public interests and the law , it might deserve consideration whether they had been led into such error by the conduct of their predecessors
