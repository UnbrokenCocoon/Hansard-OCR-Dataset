of each to render that suffering as little injurious as possible . I certainly must justify the forbearance of the former ministry ; but in doing so , I think it can not be argued that if their measure was found insufficient for the purposes intended , others more vigorous should not be adopted , in order to remove those inconveniences this country was likely to undergo in consequence of French measures . What , then 668 followed the measure of the last government , dated the 7th of Jan. ? Did neutral nations interpose ? Did the three nations whom the French Decrees materially affected interpose , in order to get them removed ? Did Denmark , Portugal , or America interpose ? I have not understood that any of these powers did endeavour to do so . On the contrary , I think we have a pretty strong Note now laid before the house , which was presented by the Danish government , complaining of the injustice of the Decree issued by G. Britain , but no inclination was evinced to revoke the previous Decree of France , nor intimating any sense of the forbearance of this country . That Note I think seems to be sounding pretty much of an Armed Neutrality , the favourite measure which Denmark has all along been aiming at ; a measure on a principle which , once adopted and carried into effect , so as to increase the maritime power of the nations on the continent , must put an end to the maritime power of G. Britain . Such has all along been the disposition of Denmark . As to Portugal , such was the unfortunate situation of that country , that with every disposition to do justice to her allies , it could not be supposed that she could venture to interfere to procure a revocation of the French Decree , when she was obviously udder the necessity of endeavouring to purchase her own neutrality . So far from her being able to do so , it was well known that the port of Lisbon was made the entrep√¥t for violating the Decree we issued upon the 7th of Jan. and breaking through the prohibition of trading from one port to another . The country from which we had reason to expect the effectual interposition , was the United States of America . Upon a former occasion that country attempted what it was called upon to do , at least so far as respected its own honour . It may be in the recollection of the house , that there was a Decree somewhat similar to the present one issued by the French government in the beginning of Jan. 1798 , when that decree was noticed in the President 's speech , as most injurious to America , and stated to be a measure that could not be suffered to exist , without violating the independence of their country . That speech strongly showed what were then the feelings and the intentions of the United States upon this subject . It showed that it was then deemed to be an unjust attack against neutral rights , and that they owned that nothing but a thorough resist- 669 ance to it could rescue them from its pernicious effects . Such was the sense of America upon the Decree of 1798 . What , now , has been the sense of America upon the Decree of 1806 ? We have a right to look to that Government for the same sort of conduct upon that subject , when there was the same sort of Decree issued by France , with the addition of declaring the British Isles in a state of blockade . Was it too much to expect of America , that on being informed of that Decree , she should consider it as a measure issued totally regard less of her rights and independence ? Was it too much to expect that she would make a firm resistance to oppose its consequences ? We shall suppose , then , that America did actually interpose , and the question must
