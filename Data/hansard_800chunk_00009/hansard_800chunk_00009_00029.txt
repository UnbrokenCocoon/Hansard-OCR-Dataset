neither to lend its aid to the confederacy against Great Britain , nor to abandon British persons and property to the possession of the French , entitled it to the confidence of his majesty 's government , and justified that government in pursuing a different line of conduct from that adopted in the case of Denmark . Adverting to the Russian Declaration , the hon . gent . contended , that a character very foreign from that of Russia marked the composition , not only in the sort of arguments adduced , but in the peculiarities of the style , which , if not French manufacture , was the most happy imitation of it that he had ever seen . Had the Russian manifesto appeared without a title , no one could have hesitated to ascribe it to the same pen as that by which the defence of it in the Moniteur had been produced.â€”The relative situation of this country and America might afford ample room for remark , but the subject was of such a delicate nature that he should abstain from enlarging upon it at present . The magnanimity of his majesty in offering reparation for injury , was most praise worthy . He trusted that the Americans would sec that it was not their true policy to unite themselves to France . The exception made in their favour in the British Orders of Council would , he hoped , be felt by them ; an exception , of the propriety of which he somewhat doubted , disposed as he was to bestow on those orders his general and decided approbation . The project of excluding us from the continent was now trying ; the trial would require on our part great constancy , great exertions , and great sacrifices .

By exerting our naval force in every possible direction , we might show the enemy that a predominant navy gives a power scarcely inferior to that of a conquering army ; we might controul the haughty mind of the ruler of France , and inspire him with that respect for this country , which alone would insure permanent tranquillity . did not rise to oppose the address , but to express his regret that when Russia offered her good offices as a mediator , his majesty 's ministers had not thought fit to accept them . He could not be suspected of any disposition at this moment to encourage a division of opinion on the subject of peace or war , after recent occurrences of considerable publicity , in which he had taken a decided part . To the opinion which he then expressed , he still adhered .
