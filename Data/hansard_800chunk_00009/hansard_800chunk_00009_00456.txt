and he is bound to 938 give me not merely the same path through his territory , thus violated , but any path which will best enable me to avert the danger arising from the former violation.—All that argument , therefore , is wholly beside the question , and tends only to confound it . So if A strikes me , I may retaliate by striking A ; and my noble and learned friend , who sits near me , knows that the law does not restrict my blow to the weight of the adversary 's , but allows me to justify whatever is necessary to repel it , and to save me harmless . But it is a new application of the term retaliation , that if A strikes me , I may retaliate by striking B . Here the phrase can not apply , either in grammar , common sense , or justice ; unless B can some how or other be justly implicated in the offence committed upon me by A : the thing is really so self-evident , that the mind gets entangled and darkened by endeavouring to make it plainer.—If the Decree , interdicting neutrals from trading with us , or visiting our ports , is executed upon a neutral , it is an interdiction which he has no right to submit to , because the moment it is executed we are injured by the interruption of his commerce with us . If he submits from favour to the unjust belligerent , he directly interposes in the war , and the neutral character is at an end ; retaliation then would not only be strictly applicable , but just and legal , and if he submits from weakness , or from any other cause not hostile or fraudulent , we have an unquestionable right , without any invasion of neutrality , to insist , that what he suffers from the enemy he shall consent to suffer from us , otherwise he would keep an open trade with the enemy at our expence , relieving him from the pressure of the war , and becoming an instrument of its illegal pressure upon us . In that case also the term retaliation , though not applicable perhaps in literal strictness , as it applies to the neutral , is substantially and justly applicable to him ; because it is in fact retaliation upon the enemy , through the sides of the neutral , in a case where the injury to us can not exist without the participation of the neutral , in doing or suffering , by either of which our commerce is alike interrupted . But I can not , my lords , conceive any thing more preposterous and senseless , than the idea of retaliation upon a neutral on whom the decree has never been executed , because it is only by its execution on him , that we can be injured : what possible right , then 939 can we have to complain of , or to take any step against a neutral , who , in no shape whatever , has been made an instrument of injustice by the enemy ? What right can we possibly have , to interdict his legal trade with the enemy , when , notwithstanding the decree complained of , we have continued in the undisturbed enjoyment of the whole trade of the neutral , just the same as if the decree had never existed ? How can we possibly retaliate upon a neutral who has done nothing and suffered nothing , although it is only by his doing or suffering that we can , by any possibility , be sufferers.—But it has been said here formerly , ( I do not mean to be irregular by alluding to the argument of any lord in particular in a former debate , ) were we to wait three months , till we could learn from America , her dispositions and intentions ? Were we to wait three months more if they were doubtful ? and , perhaps , three months afterwards , till they were ascertained and acted upon
