the naked truth ; and now I may ask the three questions Which I stated early . But if , sir , there doubts , and many doubts of the affirmative of these questions , what then is the situation to which ministers have reduced this great and generous na- 1200 tion ? What then arc the characteristics of this measure ? Sir , it is most painful , however necessary , to be compelled to find that there is so unanswerable a case against ministers , because they have had the power to sully , with their own , the character of their country . It would be useless however , to hope that Europe would be deceived , if we Would not enquire , that we could escape from the consequences , because we desired not to understand the nature of the proceedings . Since our conduct at Copenhagen will be understood by Europe for our humiliation and injury , let us be Acquainted with its nature for our reproof and reformation : —let us endeavour to understand its injustice and its impolicy , that we may repair the former , and avoid the latter.—I know , sir , that topics of this kind are not popular in this house ; that a sort of contempt is entertained for all discussions of right and wrong ; that we like to hear of our power , and not of our duties ; 'and that many , even the youngest men among us , treat these considerations with ridicule : but , sir , this is not only far from honourable , it is also far from safe . Convinced as I am , that injustice is only another name for impolicy . Viewing any transaction rather in its general consequences , than in -its immediate mischiefs to the perpetrators , I can not but hear with great apprehension , such invitations , as we have heard of late , to despise the rules and maxims of good faith , sanctioned as they have been hitherto by our own professions , and by our own practices , lest such a scepticism should lead , not only to ignominy , but to ruin.—There seems to have grown up of late a disposition to consider all political morality as an incumbrance in real affairs , and We have recently heard them ridiculed in this house , as fit only for the schools , but unfit for the guidance of parliaments , and of ministers.—And here ; sir , I can not but regret that in this new school the sages and doctors are our youngest men.—Young men , in whom we expect , and rather Wish to find some generous mistake , some graceful enthusiasm , sortie attachment to the principles , which , if well taught , they must have learnt both froth their friends , and their tutors.—I am ready to acknowledge , and . 'to praise the prematurity of their talents ; and to own-that their understandings have none of the imperfections of their years , but , sir , in their feelings , and in their principle , there seems to be 1201 an equal prematurity.—Sir , they have lived long in a little time , there is no youth in their minds : no spring in their years.—They have had the ill fortune , even if their present opinions were correct , to have lost too soon the cheering illusions of life , and I should wish them to believe that if such opinions as they have rejected , were only prejudices , that removing such prejudices is like tearing off one 's skin that we may feel the better.— But , sir , these ancient rules are not absurd prejudices , nor is our practice of late right to try how nearly we can go to the edge of right and wrong without passing over the awful boundary . It is better , sir , to keep at a safe distance : for my part , I own , sir , that I can not consent to go so nearly to the verge of the precipice
