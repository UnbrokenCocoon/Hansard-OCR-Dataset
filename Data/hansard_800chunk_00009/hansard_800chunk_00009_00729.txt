to endeavour to procure a modification of such regulations of our maritime code , as might be found to be inconsistent with justice ? The question of maritime rights was supposed to have been settled in the treaty concluded between this country and the northern powers in 1801 ; but was it not evident from this Declaration , that there was still subsisting a rankling in the mind of the Russian government upon the very question ? Mr. Whitbread contended , that this was the fair interpretation to be put upon the declaration ; and that , at present , when the contest with these powers might be said to be but beginning , it was desirable that the British house of commons should be put in possession of any document which tended to throw light upon the pretensions which they set forth . Of the substance of the communication the house was already in possession ; but he insisted upon the propriety of their being put in possession of the communication , not merely incidentally , but formally , and officially.— The other paper for which he meant to move , was the communication made by the ambassador of this country to his majesty 's secretary of state , which had been also alluded debate , and in which it had been stated by the noble lord , that a person high in authority had made use of the expression , 'il faut mena- 1356 ger l'Angleterre pour le moment ' . The noble lord had alluded to this communication in debate , for the purpose of shewing that Russia was determined to go to war with this country before the expedition was undertaken against Copenhagen ; but before the house could judge whether the fact was relevant to the argument which he grounded upon it , it was important to know who was the person who made use of this expression , and Whether it was used in conversation will the noble lord , or with a third person ; because , if it was dropped in conversation with a third person , it must be evident to every one , that it might have no effect whatever in supporting the proposition or opinion which the noble lord meant to establish . It was alleged , that this communication was made in a private letter to the secretary of state , and very probably it was so nor did he mean to question the propriety of a secretary of state keeping up a correspondence with ministers employed abroad ; but the noble lord ought not to have made use of the communication for the purpose of influencing the decision of the house , if it was of such a nature , or if was made in such a way , that it could not be laid before the house.—He did not wish that the whole of the letter or dispatch which contained the communication should be made public ; all that he desired was , that the house should be put in possession of that part of the dispatch which related to this particular communication . He concluded with moving , That an address be presented to his majesty , that he would be graciously pleased to order that there be laid before the house a copy of the Declaration delivered to his majesty 's ambassador at the court of Petersburg , notifying that his imperial majesty . would instruct his plenipotentiary at a general congress , to endeavour to procure a modification of such regulations in our maritime code as might be found to be inconsistent with justice ; and likewise of a copy or abstract of a letter or dispatch , transmitted by his majesty 's ambassador to his majesty 's foreign secretary of state , between the months of June and Nov. 1807 , as far . as such letter or dispatch may refer to an expression , 'il faut manager l'Angleterre pour le moment . ' said , that the house could not be surprised at the anxiety which he felt to express his sentiments upon the present motion , after the representations which
