that country , from whence the company apprehended the greatest 1015 danger , to its aid , he returned to Bengal , leaving the Carnatic in a state of security it had never known before . He found the important reforms in Oude but little advanced , the nabob , though the proposal of reducing his troops originated from him , when the danger from them was strong on his mind from Zeman Schah 's invasion , yet as this decreased , he became irresolute , and brought forward proposals and evasions to create delay . The security of this important frontier , which the company was bound both by treaty and its own safety to defend , was an object of too vital a concern for the governor general to permit himself to be baffled in . As an article in the last treaty empowered the company to increase its forces in Oude to the extent judged necessary for its defence , and as by the same treaty the nabob is bound to give satisfactory security for the payment of the same , the governor general knowing from the uncertainty of payments of former inferior subsidies , in times of profound peace which Oude had enjoyed for many years ( and which were only found by those usurious loans the exaction of which spread ruin and desolation amongst millions of the wretched inhabitants ) how little reliance could be placed on the discharge of an increased subsidy in time of war , when a failure might be attended with disastrous consequences , and knowing the progressive decline of the resources of the country under the nabob vizier 's government , demanded in lieu of subsidy a cession of territory , the produce of which , in its declining state , was equivalent to the support of the increased number of troops , which from the state of things was judged necessary for the protection of the province of Oude and its dependencies . To this demand the nabob vizier opposed many difficulties , during near two years . Although it had been proved repeatedly that without the British troops the dominions of Oude , if not entirely swallowed up , would have undergone great defalcations ; although he felt and acknowledged that without them , his person was not secure from his own numerous and disorderly rabble , yet from irresolution of character , practised upon by those about him , who saw that by this measure , their means of enriching themselves , by the pillage and oppression of the miserable inhabitants would be exceedingly reduced , yet it was with reluctance on his , part he assented to a treaty , which precluded any further demand upon him in any possible case , by 1016 which his own dangerous and disorderly army was to be reduced merely to what was necessary for purposes of state , in lieu of which the country was to be defended at all times , by a considerable increase of troops under British discipline . By this treaty , those districts which surrounded the antient state of Oude , which were held by turbulent Zemindars , who had many troops and strong fastnesses , from whom he could not draw revenue without annually sending a superior force to collect it at a decreased jumma ; which were most exposed to temporary depredations , and through which a powerful invasion must pass , was ceded in perpetuity to the company , and the necessity of making good a subsidy , by those usurious loans which had so large a share in the ruin of the country , and which from the nature of things must recur again , if the connection continued on the same footing , was for ever put an end to . The event has proved that the supreme government consulted not less the comfort and security of the nabob vizier , by this great measure than it did its own . This treaty was concluded on Nov. 10th 1801 , and he now enjoys from his reserved dominions a larger income applicable to his personal gratifications , than he
