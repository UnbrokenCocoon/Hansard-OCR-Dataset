that in 1798 , and was plundered of his property , in defiance of every principle of national justice . It was , therefore , but an act of common equity , that the British parliament should make some recompence to that prince . The Directors of the East India Company themselves , having perused the documents respecting this affair , were so impressed with a sense of the sufferings and oppressions heaped upon this unfortunate prince , that they had come to a resolution , that compensation ought to be made to him ; but the proposition was defeated by the Board of Controul , under the influence of the noble lord opposite ( lord Castlereagh ) , who acted on that occasion in violation of the principles of justice , and the honour and character of the British government . When two authorities in the same branch of government , like the Court of Directors and the Board of Controul , were at variance upon a point so highly interesting to the character of the British government , he thought that house was the proper tribunal to decide the question.â€”The noble lord considered this transaction as paralleled only by the late outrage on Copenhagen . He read a variety of extracts from the Oude Papers , comprehending the several treaties from 1793 to 1801 ; and also letters from lord Wellesley to the resident at Lucknow for the time being , and the answers of such Resident ; from these he argued at length , on the impolicy , injustice , cruelty , and oppression practised against the nabob , contrary to the faith of treaties which had been approved by the East India Company , and for which he thought the Nabob entitled to compensation . The noble lord concluded by moving the following Resolutions : `` 1 . That it appears to this house , that by the Treaty concluded in 1798 by 1292 lord Teignmouth ( then sir John Shore ) between Saadut Ali , Nabob of Oude , and the English East India Company , the annual subsidy of 56 lacks 77,638 rupees , then payable by the said nabob to the said East India Company , was increased to the annual sum of 76 lacks , to be paid by monthly kists of instalments : that the nabob , by the said Treaty of 1798 , agrees to exert his utmost endeavours to discharge the stipulated kists with punctuality , but if ; contrary to the sincere intentions of the said nabob , the payment of the kists should fall into arrears , the said nabob Saadut Ali engages and promises that he will then give such security to the Company for the discharge of the existing arrears , and the future regular payment of the kists , as shall be deemed satisfactory ; that by the said Treaty it was also agreed , that all transactions between the two States , 'shall be carried on with the greatest cordiality and harmony on both sides , ' and the said nabob 'shall possess full authority over his household affairs , hereditary dominions , his troops , and his subjects . ' 2 . That the Court of Directors of the said East India Company did approve of the said Treaty of 1798 , and in May 1799 declared it to be 'an arrangement redounding highly to the honour of lord Teignmouth , who negotiated it , likely to operate to the reciprocal advantage of the Company and the nabob vizier ; ' and that the affairs of Oude were thus settled in a manner which bids fair to be permanent . ' 3 . That by a Treaty concluded in 1801 by the marquis Wellesley , then governor general of India , the said Saadut Ali cedes to the East India Company in perpetual sovereignty a portion of his territory , amounting in the gross yearly revenue ( as is stated in the said Treaty ) to one crore and 35 lacks of rupees , in lieu of the stipulated subsidy , and agrees to admit the troops of the said Company to
