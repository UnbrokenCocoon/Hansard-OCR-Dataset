be our future fate , the greatest glory that attends this country , a greater than any nation under heaven ever enjoyed or even contemplated , is to have formed and nursed up to such a state of security and happiness those communities which we are now so eager to oppress , and even to extinguish . We ought to cherish them as the immortal monuments of our public justice and wisdom ; as the heirs of our better days ; of our old arts and manners , and of our expiring national virtues , For what work of art , or power , or public utility , ever equalled the glory of having peopled a vast continent without guilt or bloodshed ? To have given them the best arts of life and government , and to have suffered them , under the shelter of our authority , to acquire in peace the skill to use them ? In comparison of this , the policy of governing by influence , and even the pride of war and victory , are dishonest tricks , and poor , contemptible , pageantry . '—My lords , I should hope that these sentiments would have more particular weight with the reverend lords opposite , as proceeding from so distinguished a member of their own order ; I should hope that they would think it no offence to that uniform system of support , which I can not doubt that their consciences have dictated in the present difficult times to be due to the administration of the government , if , upon this occasion , they were to give their voice and support to principles which are the sole 969 fruit of the religion they teach ; the offspring of the gospel which they propagate .

That the same can not in any case be justified , but by some unforeseen and urgent necessity endangering the public safety . And that in every such case it is the duty of his majesty 's ministers to advise his majesty , after issuing such order , forthwith to assemble his parliament , in order both that the necessity of such proceeding may be inquired of and determined ; and that due provision may be made for the public safety , by the authority of his majesty in parliament.—3d , That the Law of Nations is a part of the law of the land , and that neutral nations , not interposing in the war between his majesty and his enemies , have a legal right to such freedom of commerce and navigation , as is secured to them by the-Law of Nations.—4th , That the late Orders of his majesty in Council , are contrary to the law of nations , inasmuch as they purport to
