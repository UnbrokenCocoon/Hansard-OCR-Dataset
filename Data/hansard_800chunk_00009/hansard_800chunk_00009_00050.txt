this all ? â€”No : for the country , I understand , has paid still a much dearer price ; for in consequence of the avidity for conveying , those prizes to British ports , so completely has our commercial marine in the Baltic been abandoned and exposed , that the enemy has actually captured more of those very stores from you than you have taken of him , and this on board of five or six and fifty British vessels in the Baltic trade , which have fallen into his hands since the departure of the British fleet from the Copenhagen expedition . Let us therefore ; sir , put all the advantages we have obtained in the scale against the moral justice we have violated , and the dignity of character we have lost by this adventure , and ask , if it is such a proceeding as entitles his majesty 's ministers , who planned the enterprize , to the approbation and thanks of this house . In the language of his majesty 's ministers and their supporters , every hour teems with , abuse of the present ruler of France , and every day brings forth some new accusation against Buonaparte , as an usurper , a tyrant , a murderer , a plunderer , and every thing atrocious and abominable ; and I am sorry to observe , sir , this language echoed through the public prints of this country , the editors of which are sensible men , and would not , I and sure , persevere in such abuse , if they were not encouraged to it . It is , however , something to the character of that ruler , that towards the enemies who have left the power of doing him injury , he has acted with humanity . But British rulers have lost all character for humanity or national honour , by the attack upon a peaceable and defenceless nation , which 78 had no power to injure or even resist them ; and they have thus put it into the mouth of every Frenchman to retort upon them the charge of all those enormities with which we have accused France . The French ruler may say to his majesty 's ministers , `` you may talk about my having seized the duke D'Enghien , on a neutral frontier and put hint to death . But I answer , it was an act of violence necessary to my own defence , surrounded on all sides as I was , at home and abroad , by nations and partisans conspiring for my destruction . But you , who had nothing to fear from Denmark , a distant , peaceable , unoffensive , neutral nation ; you have wantonly violated her neutrality ; you have attacked her unawares ; you have bombarded her capital , you have thrown bombs , shells , and rockets to set fire to the habitations of her peaceable citizens , and you have deluged their public streets with the blood of their murdered wives and children , whose mutilated bodies have been left unburied , on purpose to excite new rage , horror , and indignation against the British nation and name . '' There is this great difference between the situation of the heads of the government in the British and French nations : the ruler of France has been raised by his own efforts to the situation in which he is placed , and was surrounded on all sides by enemies confederated for the subversion of his government , and the destruction of his life . But will any man say the head of the British government feels any apprehensions of such atrocities ; that our gracious monarch has any thing to fear from conspiracy , against the safety of his sacred person , or the security of his crown ? The ruler of France may plead , in the jealousy , hatred , and assassinating spirit of his enemies , an excuse for his atrocities , which the rulers of this country can not offer ; our government has no charge to apprehend ,
