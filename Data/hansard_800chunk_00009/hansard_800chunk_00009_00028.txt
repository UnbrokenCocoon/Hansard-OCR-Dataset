Estimates of the current year to be laid before us ; and to assure his majesty , that he may confidently rely upon our readiness to make such provision for the public service as the urgency of affairs may require : —That we hear with great satisfaction , that notwithstanding the difficulties which the enemy has endeavoured to impose upon the Commerce of his majesty 's subjects , and upon their 45 intercourse with other nations , the resources of the country have continued in the last year to he so abundant , as to have produced , both from the temporary and permanent revenue , receipts considerably larger than that of the preceding year ; and that our satisfaction , arising from this proof of the solidity of these resources , will be greatly increased , if , according to the hope which his majesty has been graciously pleased to express , we shall be enabled to raise the necessary supplies for the ' present year , without any material additions to the public burdens : —To assure his majesty , that we feel the firmest conviction , that , if ever there was a just and national war , it is that which his majesty is now compelled to prosecute : that this war in its principle is purely defensive ; and that much as we should rejoice , in common with his majesty , at the attainment of a peace which would secure to us the safety and blessings which belong to peace , yet that we are firmly persuaded , that such a peace can only be negotiated on a tooting of perfect equality : and that if we display , as it is our fixed determination to do , in this crisis of the fate of the country , the characteristic spirit of the British nation , and face unappalled the unnatural combination which is gathered around us , the struggle , under the blessing of Divine Providence , will prove successful and glorious to Great Britain : —And finally to assure his majesty , that in this awful and momentous contest , we confidently rely upon the firmness of his majesty , who has no cause but that of his people ; and that his majesty may reciprocally rely on the constancy and the affectionate support of his faithful commons .
