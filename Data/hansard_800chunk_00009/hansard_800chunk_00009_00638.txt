front those measures of hostility against Russia , which it was their duty to have recommended , had they really believed in the existence of such engagements ; but they actually solicited that war , and her mediation to extinguish that war , and her guarantee to defeat those projects , in which it is now pretended she was known to have been a. principal and contracting party.—That allegations , thus inconsistent with themselves , and contrary to admitted facts rather weaken than support the case to which they are applied.— That , with respect to the pretended necessity of the case , we beg leave respectfully to assure his majesty , that we can not think so meanly of the power and resources of his empire , of the spirit of his people , or of the valour and discipline of his fleets and armies , as to admit that such an act would have been required Mr any purpose of self-preservation.—And that , whatever temporary advantages the possession of the ships and stores taken at Copenhagen may afford , have been more than counter balanced by the increased dangers arising from the manner by which they have been obtained.—That this measure , so highly objectionable both in policy and in principle , has augmented the number of our enemies ; has animated against us the passions of whole nations , who before 1215 were amicably disposed towards us , and has , above all , shaken our own reliance on the justice of our cause ; the only sentiment which has hitherto upheld us in all our difficulties ; commanding the respect of other nations , and inspiring our own people with a confident expectation , under the blessing of providence , of a successful termination of a long and arduous contest.—That we are ever unwilling to pronounce definitely on a measure , the whole grounds of which are not before us : but that , in a case which above all others required the dearest proof , we have the deep mortification of being compelled to acknowledge , that every presumption is against us ; and that no evidence has yet been adduced on which we can safely rest the defence of our country , from accusations the most injurious to our national character .

The Copenhagen Expedition was undertaken , and justified , on the grounds of the unquestionable and declared intentions of the French government to turn the whole power of the continent against England ; and the inability of Denmark to resist the coercion of France , and her unwillingness to irritate , by any appearance of a disposition to resist . The hon . gent . went through all the arguments advanced in the former discussions relative to this subject , to shew that France was determined and prepared to force Denmark into her system ; and that Denmark was unprepared and undetermined to make any opposition . He stated , from high authority , that if the Expedition to Copenhagen had not taken place , France would have had under her controul , and at her disposal , a fleet of 70 sail of the line , from Antwerp , North , including Dutch , Danes , Russians , and Swedes ; for when menaced by Russia on One side , and France and Denmark , with the whole of the Danish fleet on the other , Sweden could not long , hold out . He concluded , from a view of all the arguments , that the capture of the Danish fleet was not only necessary and justifiable , but highly commendable . In that view he thought the house bound to set a fixed mark of its approbation on a measure Which it had repeatedly sanctioned with its full assent in a variety of forms . He there- 1216 fore designed , after the present question was disposed of ,
