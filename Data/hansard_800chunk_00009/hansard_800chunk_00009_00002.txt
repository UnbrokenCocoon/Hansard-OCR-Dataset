state of blockade , and subjected to seizure and confiscation the produce and manufactures of his kingdom , his majesty resorted in the first instance to a measure of mitigated retaliation ; and that , this measure having proved ineffectual for its object , his majesty has since found it necessary to adopt others of greater rigour , which he commands us to state to you will require the aid of parliament to give them complete and effectual operation.—His majesty has directed copies of the Orders which he has issued ( with the advice of his privy council ) upon this subject , to be laid before you ; and he commands us to recommend them to your early attention . `` Gentlemen of the House of Commons , `` His majesty has directed the Estimates for the year to be laid before you , in the fullest confidence that your loyalty and public spirit will induce you to make such provision for the public service as the urgency of affairs may require.—His majesty has great satisfaction in informing you , that notwithstanding the difficulties which the enemy has endeavoured to impose upon the Commerce of his subjects , and upon their intercourse with other nations , the resources of the country have continued in the last year to be so abundant , as to have produced both from the permanent and temporary revenue a receipt considerably larger than that of the preceding year.—The satisfaction which his majesty feels assured you will derive , in common with his majesty , from this proof of the solidity of these resources , can not but he greatly increased , if , as his majesty confidently hopes , it shall be found possible to raise the necessary supplies for the present year without any material additions to the public burdens . `` My Lords and Gentlemen , `` We are especially commanded to say to you , in the name of his majesty , that if ever there was a just and national war , it is that which his majesty is now compelled to prosecute . —This war is in its principle purely defensive : his majesty looks but to the attainment of a secure and honourable Peace ; but such a peace can only be negotiated upon a footing of perfect equality.—The eyes of Europe and of the world are fixed upon the British parliament . If , as his majesty confidently trusts , you dis- 6 play in this crisis of the fate of the country the ? characteristic spirit of the British nation , and face unappalled the unnatural combination which is gathered around us , his majesty bids us to assure you of his firm persuasion , that , under the blessing of Divine Providence , the struggle will prove ultimately successful and glorious to Great Britain.—We are lastly commanded to assure you , that in this awful and momentous contest you may rely upon the firmness of his majesty , who has no cause but that of his people , and that his majesty reciprocally relies upon the wisdom , the constancy , and the affectionate support of his parliament .

The archbishop of York and earl Grey , also took the oaths and their seats . Their lordships then adjourned during pleasure . At five o'clock the house resumed . His majesty 's most gracious Speech was then read by the lord chancellor from the woolsack , and afterwards by the clerk at the table , after which The Earl of Galloway rose , and addressed their lordships as follows : —My lords ; after the Speech which your lordships have heard delivered by his majesty 's command , it is expected some member of this house should present himself to your notice , to solicit that attention which the importance of the subject demands ; and by endeavouring to obtain your cordial concurrence in an Address of thanks to his majesty
