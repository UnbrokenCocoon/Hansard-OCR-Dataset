, `` That an humble Address be presented to his majesty , submitting , That after attentively considering all the public documents before us concerning the late attack on Copenhagen , and the war which it had produced , we have found the information 874 which they afford extremely imperfect and unsatisfactory.—That in a matter in which both the honour and the interests of our country are so deeply concerned we had hoped for the fullest explanations . The principles of our constitution and the uniform practice of his majesty , and the sovereigns of his illustrious house , require , that parliament should be distinctly apprized of the true grounds of entering into new wars , especially in a situation of our country wholly unprecedented.—Had Denmark been a party to any hostile confederacy against the rights or interests of the British empire , our resistance would have been necessary , and our warfare legitimate . Under such circumstances , we should only have had to regret , that the ports and arsenals of that country should so lightly have been abandoned , when advantages so very inconsiderable had been derived from their temporary occupation , and when by our continuing to hold them during the war , all real danger from that quarter might have been effectually averted.—But we can not doubt , that Denmark , instead of engaging in hostile leagues , had resolved still to maintain her neutrality.—This fact is proved even by the imperfect documents which have been laid before us , and is confirmed by the proclamation issued by his majesty 's commanders immediately before the attack.—Certainly Denmark was no party , nor does it appear that she was privy to any confederacy hostile to this country . We are not even satisfied that such a league did really exist.—The conclusion of any secret articles at Tilsit affecting the rights or interests of the British empire appears to have been uniformly denied both by Russia and France.—The correspondence of his majesty 's secretary of state , and . the dates of the transactions themselves ; prove that his majesty 's ministers could not be in possession of any such articles when the attack was ordered against Copenhagen ; and it has been distinctly admitted in this house , that they have not yet obtained a copy of them.—The king 's ambassador at Petersburgh , in an official note , rested the defence of the measure not on any hostile purposes either of Denmark or of Russia , but solely on the designs which it was said the French government had long since been known to entertain.—His majesty 's ministers not only forbore to advise such measures as would have been necessary to repel any real hostility of Russia : but they actually solicited the mediation of 875 that power , to extinguish a war , and her guaranty to defeat projects in which it is now pretended they knew her to have been a principal and contracting party.—Allegations thus inconsistent with each other , and contrary to admitted facts , weaken , instead of supporting the cause to which they are applied.—With respect to the alledged necessity of the case , we beg leave to assure his majesty , that we can not think so meanly of the power and resources of his empire , of the spirit of his people , or of the valour and discipline of his fleets and armies , as to admit that such an act could have been required for any purpose of self-preservation.—Any temporary advantages which the possession of such ships and stores as were taken at Copenhagen can afford , are already much more than counterbalanced by the other consequences of a measure which appears not less objectionable in policy than in principle . That measure has augmented the number of our enemies ; it has countenanced the injurious representations circulated throughout Europe respecting our principles and designs ; and has inflamed against us the warmest passions of neutral and of friendly nations.—But it has above all shaken our own persuasion of the justice of our cause : a sentiment which had hitherto supported us through all
