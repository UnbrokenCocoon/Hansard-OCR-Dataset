sir , the difficulties are neither few ; nor inconsiderable , which must be surmounted by any man who has to request that the thoughts of parliament may again be directed to a subject already so frequently discussed in many of its parts , and on which most of the distinguished persons in this country have communicated the information which they had to give , declared the sentiments that they had formed , and detailed , too , at so much length and with so much ability , the arguments by which they supported such sentiments . Yet perhaps , sir , it may not be wholly useless , perhaps it may be very advantageous that parliament should be reminded , ( though by me very briefly ) of some of those facts , opinions and reasonings , in a stage of this important business , which it was impossible to omit , without leaving the discussion imperfect , and the sentiments of parliament undeclared.—But , sir , in truth these several debates , to which I allude , have rather been of a preliminary and preparatory nature , clearing the way for a final and solemn examination of the conduct of ministers , by which they have had the courage to say ( courage is not the word , sir ) that they have saved their country , but by which , in a transaction of the greatest importance to the national character and interests , the former may have obviously been disgraced , and the latter destroyed.—There are however , sir , other reasons rendering it highly proper to bring this subject again before the eyes of parliament for mi- 1186 nisters have thought fit in every debate to tell us in a triumphant and taunting tone , that what they , have been doing has been sanctioned by universal approbation . This assertion , so loudly and , so often repeated , renders it incumbent on every man who thinks himself and the public calumniated by this imputation , to take every proper opportunity of denying his concurrence , and of disclaiming any participation in the sanction so skilfully , but so unjustly taken for granted . The public opinion , sir , to this effect , may conditionally perhaps have been expressed very early in this proceeding ( though I am far from thinking that it has ) , but that opinion , if it even existed , has certainly changed most rapidly , and the conduct of ministers in acting without the necessary evidence , or in suppressing that evidence , seems now to have occasioned an universal surprize and censure.—Such an approbation may have been obtained by false pretences , the conscience of the people may have been surprized ; they may have thought it but justice to ministers to presume that they would justify their conduct , but , sir , we ought not to do the public the injustice to believe , that they deliberately approve this remarkable measure , unless it be defended by facts that are incontestible , and by reasonings that are unanswerable , both proving its overruling , evident , irresistible necessity.—It is , sir , very easy to conceive that the capture of many ships of the line , and an arsenal of stores would , at first sight , be very striking to the imaginations of the people of this country , who feel at all times with such extreme sensibility whatever is connected with the navy ; the navy ; sir , at once the source of their security and of their glory . But it would be libeling both their hearts and their understandings not to believe that they took it for granted , that information , indubitable information , would be afforded to them , proving the urgent necessity of obtaining these ships , and these stores , by besieging the capital , and destroying the inhabitants of a nation with whom , two very short interruptions excepted , their fathers and themselves had been at peace for centuries , and with whom our connections had recently increased in a Most remarkable degree
