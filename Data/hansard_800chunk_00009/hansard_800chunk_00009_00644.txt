and a foreign nation , but by taking such a line as should satisfy the judgments of the majority of the country , and command the respect of the : states of Europe ; we should otherwise justify the imputations but too successfully propagated against England by the French , that , in her conduct to foreign states , she was alone actuated by a narrow and selfish policy . The conclusions he should endeavour to establish were drawn from a diligent and repeated examination of the papers before the house , and after which he was sorry to be obliged to express his solemn conviction that , in the attack on Denmark , ministers had commited an unprovoked and unjustifiable outrage . Denmark had adopted a line of policy which , whether most agreeable to our wishes or interests , it must be admitted she had a right to adopt , namely , one of strict neutrality . It might not , however , be immaterial to consider that that system suggested by wisdom , had also been justified by experience , and that the great minister of that nation had conducted his country during the perils and shocks of 1224 the revolutionary war , not only with safety , not only to the preservation of the happiness of his fellow-subjects , but greatly to the extension of national prosperity and power.—No slight inducement to a perseverance in the same salutary system . Having adopted that system , it appeared , from a fair and strict analysis of the papers , that Denmark adhered to it with undeviating strictness , and with equal fidelity towards the belligerent parties.— When France approached her frontiers , she required and received explanations which satisfied her , and which , in reason , ought for the positions taken up by the French troops , were naturally such as were suitable to the war in which France was engaged against G. Britain and Sweden . As to the particular act of trifling violation of ground , ample reparation seems to have been made , and there certainly does not appear any intended infraction of the Danish neutrality ; that such a case was possible , if not probable , in the course of the war , is not doubted , and the Danes themselves foresaw it ; but how could that be brought to justify our attack on Denmark ; should Denmark be ultimately forced from her neutrality , it was evident not only that , it was best the outrage should come from France—it was not only compatible with Danish interest , but had been actually pointed out by the Danish ministers , to Mr. Garlike , as more compatible with the eventual interests of Great Britain , Russia , and Sweden ; the latter a strong concession , by which count Bernstorff , not only evinced ere policy , but the zeal with which , under such circumstances , he would be enabled to support the common cause , when he could promise from it an extinction of those nearly insurmountable antipathies which separated Sweden and Denmark.—In the view of such a case , arrangements had actually been made in Denmark ; the troops were gradually withdrawn from the frontier to the centre of Holstein , and to the islands ; and it was emphatically announced , by count Bernstorff , that such eventual invasion of Holstein , by the French , would establish , de facto , an alliance , offensive and defensive , between Denmark , Russia , Sweden , and England . But not only was that proved by the papers , but by a fair consideration of Danish interest , we could not doubt that such would be the policy of the Danish court ; on the one hand , to retain a nominal authority in Holstein and Jutland , dependent on French moderation , she 1225 would hazard her navy , her islands , and her trade . On the other , by the sacrifice of the continental duchies , valuable certainly , but not the most valuable of her possessions , she would retain her colonies
