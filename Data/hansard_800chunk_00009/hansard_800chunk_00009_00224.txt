make diversions we should at least have made preparations . If a case did not occur , a case might occur . To this he thought it no bad answer for a statesman to say , that in fact no such case ever had occurred . He confessed , that from the first opening of the campaign , neither he nor his colleagues were sanguine in their hopes of success , and while they were endeavouring to counteract the fatal delusion , in which the country from long habits was too prone to indulge , he had 448 not forgotten the pains which were taken to represent them as gloomy , spiritless , and apprehensive , because they would not condescend , by an empty shew of preparation , to court a reputation for vigour . There was only one case , in which he thought that great and ample sacrifices ought to have been made , in the event of procuring the co-operation of Austria.—But the noble lord had said , that pecuniary aid might have been afforded ; that the late ministers refused even to sanction a Russian loan in this country of six millions . To this he would answer , that under the state of affairs on the continent , when facilities of raising money were required of this country , the money could not be obtained here without the guarantee of government ; and , taught by the experience of a former guarantee for an Austrian loan , it behoved the late government to act with some caution before she gave another guarantee for such a sum as 6 millions , which might ultimately fall as a burthen on the people of this country . But , said the noble lord , you might have granted a subsidy of 3 millions , and you would then at least have shewn your zeal to assist Russia , and secured her good opinion , by shewing her , that you felt for her distresses . He would answer , that they were ready to subsidize , if it could have been stewn that any good to be gained by it . Noble lords said , but why did you not at least make a shew of diversion , by collecting a large fleet of transports , and a march of troops to your coasts , in order to excite alarm in the enemy and divide his attention ? To this he would answer , that the enemy knew as well as we that we could not be serious in such an enterprize , which served only to delude our ally , and encourage him to continue a fruitless contest . Still , his lordship said , the country was not without resources , and could have gone very great lengths both in military and pecuniary aids , had there been a probability of such aid being in any way useful ; and as to an observation made that the late ministry should have advised Russia to make peace with France , he would not transgress the point of order so recently discussed , by stating the contents of dispatches ; but if the noble secretary of state would read the Russian dispatches of the last three months , he was confident he would never again come down to that house , and rebuke him on the same ground.—The noble lord next adverted to the disastrous issue of the war , 449 and the final loss of Europe—a consequence which he did not hesitate to impute to a measure from which he was always strongly , averse , and which , had not the country and the world sustained the calamitous loss of a great statesman now no more , probably might not have happened , namely , the last continental coalition of the powers of Europe in 1805 , stirred up by this country to a renewal of the war against France , at a time when they were actually unprepared for such a contest . The utter defeat of Austria was one of the first fruits of that conflict , which was commenced in direct opposition
