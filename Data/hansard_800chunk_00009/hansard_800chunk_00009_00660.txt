relation of the person who sent him ) could explain . rose considerably agitated by the allusion reflecting on the conduct of Mr. Fox , in a transaction which happened nearly 20 years ago , and of which he was certainly too young at the time to know the circumstances . The insinuations upon it , however , had been so repeatedly proved to be absurd , that nothing but the perverse spirit which had been manifested that night , could have again brought it up . The noble lord had said , that if the conduct of the ministers who had made the coalition that ended so fatally for Austria was criminal , it ought to have been questioned . To this lord Holland replied , that probably his friends ought to have instituted an inquiry into it . Their motives of forbearance , he thought , would have been obvious to every noble lord , viz . that as the administration who bad made that coalition , had lost the person who was most distinguished for talents , they thought it illiberal to pursue the rest of the body . disclaimed the slightest intention of wounding the feelings of the noble lord.â€”The question was then put , and negatived . informed the house , that the Petition , complaining of an undue election and return for the city and liberty of Westminster , having been appointed to be taken into consideration upon Tuesday last , at half an hour after three in the afternoon , the right hon . Richard Brinsley Sheridan , the petitioner , did not appear before the house , by himself , his counsel , or agents , within one hour after the time so appointed ; and that , in pursuance of an act , made in the 28th year of his present majesty , he had certified into the court of exchequer the Recognizance entered into in respect of the said petition , and had also certified the default which had been made in the performance of the condition of the said recognizance . rose , pursuant to notice , to move for certain papers relative to the mode of raising money by the Grand Jury Presentments in Ireland . He wished to avoid any discussion on the subject till the papers were laid on the table ; but he would state the course he meant to pursue , and the object he had in view , in order to prevent misconception . He moved for these papers on two grounds : first , with reference to the amount of the sums raised , and secondly , with respect to the mode of raising them . He did not mean to question the powers of the Grand Juries , or to transfer these powers to any other quarter . But he wished to have some more equal mode of collecting the tax , and a better mode of accounting for the money . He intended once to include all this in a bill relative to the Irish roads ; but the subject was so extensive and important that it would be better to refer it to a committee of the house , by which means it might come more particularly under the review of such as were acquainted with the mode of raising , applying and accounting for county money in England . An account of the amount had been already laid on the table . What he wanted now was an account of the mode of application , of the way in which the money was accounted for , and of the time the grand juries had for the 1251 performance of this duty . He therefore moved first , for an account of the presentments for raising money during the spring and summer assizes in 1807 , specifying the mode of application . 2d . For copies of the Quere Books in the hands of the Irish treasurer , as far as related to the above period , with a view to shew the method of accounting . And 3dly , For the number or informations and bills of indictment
