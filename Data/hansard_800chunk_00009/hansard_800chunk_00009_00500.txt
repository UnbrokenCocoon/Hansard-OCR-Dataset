that the demand of a territorial cession was made under the pretence of obtaining security for the regular payment of the subsidy ; but that the nabob Saadut Ali was always punctual , not only in discharging the monthly kists , but also in satisfying the further demands made upon him on account of the additional troops , and incessant in his applications to the British resident for advice and assistance in providing permanent funds for the payment of the same ; and that therefore the said demand of territorial cession was unjust , and in direct violation of the provisions of the treaty . '' — '' That it appears that , pending the negotiations respecting the territorial cession , demands were urged upon the nabob 1003 for arrears of payment of troops , unjustifiable in their principle , and exorbitant in their amount , calculated upon the principle of 'including every fixed and contingent expence for buildings , camp equipage , & c. ; ' and 'on the supposition that the corps were complete ; ' though it was confessed that they were not so , and claimed upon grounds inconsistent with the true spirit of the treaty . '' — '' That it appears , that the demand of territory in perpetual sovereignty , to the amount of one crore and 35 lacks of rupees of annual revenue , was exorbitant and unjust , inasmuch as it was perpetual possession in annual income to the full amount of a temporary and occasional demand ; and inasmuch as the said temporary and occasional demand was in part calculated on the supposition of the necessity of the presence of troops—1st , to overawe the licentious disposition of the nabob 's battalions , and to repress the disorders arising from the bad police of his reserved dominions ; which necessity was however removed by the very treaty itself , whereby the nabob was bound to disband all his troops not necessary for the purposes of state , and of collection of revenue , and to establish in his reserved dominions a system of police , under the advice and controul of the company 's officers ; and , 2ndly , to defend the province of Oude against the dangers arising from the invasion of Zemaun Shah , though the nabob was at the same time called upon by the marquis Wellesley , to defray a 'proportion of the expences at 'tending the embassy into Persia , ' which had been employed 'in negociating there an arrangement to prevent any return of the same danger . ' '' — '' That it appears that the demand of the specific territory of the alledged annual revenue of one crore and 35 lacks of rupees , was exorbitant and unjust ; inasmuch as it was capable of immediate increase , and actually did yield , in the year immediately succeeding , the actual revenue of one crore and 57 lacks of rupees ; and the settlement thereof for the 3 next succeeding years was at the average annual amount of one crore and 80 lacks of rupees , independent of the profit derivable from the monopoly of salt , estimated at 11 lacks ; inasmuch as the said revenue was regularly and progressively increasing from year to year ; and inasmuch as Mr. Henry . Wellesley , the governor of the ceded provinces , stated , that he had no 1004 doubt , that 'the settlement of the land revenue for the second period of 3 years would not be less than 2 crores of rupees ; ' and that 'the land revenue of these provinces , when fully cultivated , would amount to two crores and 50 lacks of rupees . ' '' — `` That it appears from the whole of the transactions related in the Papers now under consideration , and from the negotiations carried on by the marquis Wellesley with the nabob Saadut Ali , in the year 1798 , 1799 , 1800 , 1801 , and 1802 , that the said marquis Wellesley , actuated by unjustifiable ambition and love of power , had formed schemes of aggrandizement
