to himself ; and I own , sir , that if some attempt had not been made to restore the national character , and if , while I had the honour to sit in this house , either indolence or timidity had 1213 deterred me from exerting , to the utmost , my feeble powers in the support of such an attempt , the recollection of having had a seat here , would be a never-failing source of regret and Self-reproach—Liberavi animam meam.—I have discharged what I feel to be my duty , and I am sure of my reward in the satisfaction of having overcome my reluctance to present myself to the house on so important an occasion . I shall have entered my protest ( and shall have given other gentlemen more able an opportunity to do the same ) against a measure , which in my conscience , I think to be equally injurious to the character and to the interests of my country , and , in defence of which , I have heard no facts alledged but such as are untrue or unproved , and no arguments employed but such as are inapplicable or frivolous.—I shall conclude , sir with moving , `` That an humble Address be presented to his majesty , submitting to his majesty , that we have attentively considered all the information before us , respecting the late attack on Copenhagen , and the war in which we have consequently been involved ; and that we deeply lament to have found it imperfect , contradictory , and unsatisfactory in all its parts.—That respecting a transact on in which both the honour and the interests of our country are so deeply concerned , we had hoped for the fullest explanation.—That the principles of our constitution , and the uniform practice of his majesty and the sovereigns of his illustrious house , require that parliament should be distinctly apprized of the true grounds of entering into new wars , and especially in a situation of the country so extraordinary and unprecedented as the present.—That had Denmark been a party to any hostile confederacy , either for menacing his majesty 's territories or invading his maritime rights , our resistance would have been necessary , and our warfare legitimate ; and that under such circumstances , this house would only have had to regret that his majesty should have been advised So lightly to abandon the ports and arsenals of that country ; for , that had the leged danger been real , the possession of those ports during the war would have afforded the best security against that danger ; whereas the abandonment of them has now left us more than ever exposed to it.—But that we can entertain no doubt , that instead of engaging in hostile leagues . Denmark wished only to maintain her neutrality ; that this fact is proved 1214 even by the imperfect documents which have been laid before us ; acknowledged in the proclamation issued by his majesty 's commanders immediately before the attack.—That note only was Denmark no party to such a league , but we see no ground to believe that she was privy to it ; and the very fact of its existence is , to say the least , in the highest degree questionable.—That the conclusion of any secret articles at Tilsit , affecting the rights or interests of this country , appears to have been uniformly denied , both by Russia and France ; and that the correspondence of his majesty 's secretary of state , and the dates of the transactions prove , that if any such articles did exist , his majesty 's ministers were not in possession of them , when the attack was ordered against Copenhagen.—That his majesty 's ambassador at St. Petersburgh , in an Official note , rested the defence Of that measure , not on the hostile purposes either of Denmark or of Russia , hut solely on designs which it was said the French government had long been known to entertain.—And , that his majesty 's ministers not only advised his majesty to abstain
