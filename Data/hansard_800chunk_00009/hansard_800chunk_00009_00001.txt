ministers from those powers have demanded and received their passports . — ? This measure , on the part of Russia , has been attempted to be justified by a statement of wrongs and grievances which have no real foundation . The emperor of Russia had indeed proffered his mediation between his majesty and France ; his majesty did not refuse that mediation ; but he is confident you will feel the propriety of its not having been accepted , until his majesty should have been enabled to ascertain that Russia was in a condition to mediate impartially , and until the principles and the basis on which France was ready to negotiate were made known to his majesty.—No pretence of justification has been alleged for the hostile conduct of the emperor of Austria , or for that of his Prussian majesty . His majesty has not given the slightest ground of complaint to either of those sovereigns , nor even at the moment when they have respectively withdrawn their ministers have they assigned to his majesty any distinct cause for that proceeding.—His majesty has directed , that Copies of the Official Notes which passed between his majesty 's ambassador and the minister for foreign affairs of his imperial majesty the empe- 4 ror of Russia , pending the Negotiations at Tilsit , as well as of the Official Note of the Russian minister at this court , which contain the offer of his Imperial majesty 's mediation , and of the Answer returned to that Note by his majesty 's command ; and also Copies of the Official Notes of the Austrian minister at this court , and of the Answers which his majesty commanded to be returned to them , shall be laid before you.—It is with concern that his majesty commands us to inform you , that , notwithstanding his earnest wishes to terminate the war in which he is engaged with the Ottoman Porte , his majesty 's endeavours , unhappily for the Turkish empire , have been defeated by the machinations of France , not less the enemy of the Porte than of Great Britain.—But while the influence of France has been thus unfortunately successful in preventing the termination of existing hostilities , and in exciting new wars against this country , his majesty commands us to inform you , that the king of Sweden has resisted every attempt to induce him to abandon his alliance with Great Britain ; and that his majesty entertains no doubt that you will feel with him , the sacredness of the duty which the firmness and fidelity of the king of Sweden impose upon his majesty , and that you will concur in enabling his majesty to discharge it in a manner worthy of this country.— ? It remains for us , according to his majesty 's commands , to state to you , that the Treaty of Amity , Commerce , and Navigation between his majesty and the United States of America , which was concluded and signed by commissioners , duly authorized for that purpose , on the 31st of December 1806 , has not taken effect , in consequence of the refusal of the President of the United States to ratify that instrument.—For an unauthorized act of force committed against an American ship of war , his majesty did not hesitate to offer immediate and spontaneous reparation : but an attempt has been made by the American government to connect with the question which has arisen out of this act , pretensions inconsistent with the maritime rights of Great Britain : such pretensions his majesty is determined never to admit . His majesty nevertheless hopes , that the American government will be actuated by the same desire to preserve the relations of peace and friendship between the two countries , which has ever influenced his majesty 's conduct , and that any difficulties in the discussion now depend- 5 ing may be effectually removed.—His majesty has commanded us to state to you , that , in consequence of the Decree by which France declared the whole of his majesty 's dominions to be in a
