Sir ; I take the earliest opportunity of acknowledging your letter of the 29th inst . transmitting authenticated copies of the Resolutions of the 28th inst . by which the house of commons have been pleased to vote their Thanks to the commander of the forces , to the general officers , and to the several officers of the army under his command , during the siege of Copenhagen , and to approve and acknowledge the regularity , discipline , valour , and exertions , of the non-commissioned officers and private men employed on that service ; the house being further pleased to appoint , that these Resolutions shall be communicated by me to the generals and other officers who served in that army.—I have to request that you will have the goodness to state for me to the house , that it affords me great gratification to have the honour of communicating these Resolutions respectively , and without delay , to the several general officers named in your letter , and to the other officers of the army lately under my command . Several of these distinguished officers , and many of the non-commissioned officers and private soldiers , have already received the thanks of parliament , or the notification of the recorded approval of their services on former occasions ; and I am confident that all of them will feel as they ought to do , the high distinction now conferred upon them ; and that they will do credit to their country and to themselves where-ever they may be employed.—For my own part , sir , I find it impossible to express the sentiments which arise in my mind , on learning that any endeavours of mine , faithfully and conscientiously to discharge the duties of my profession as a British officer , entrusted with command on an important service , should have procured for me the Thanks of the house of commons.—Suffice it therefore to say , that I most gratefully receive this distinguished honour , with the most exalted respect for the house of parliament from whence it flows , and the greatest humility in regard to my own desert.—I beg to offer my best acknowledgements to you , sir , for the personal civilities with which you have been pleased to accompany the transmission of this signal mark of the approbation of the house of Commons ; and I have the honour to be , sir , your most obedient , & c. as the propriety of the late bargain between the Bank of England and the government , with a view to the public service , was to be discussed on Monday , thought it right to move that copies of all correspondence between the governor and deputy governor of the bank and the chancellor of the exchequer , since the 1st of May last , relative to the management of the public debt , the application of unclaimed dividends , and loans from the bank to the public , be laid before the house . The propriety of having these written documents was suggested by the recollection of the failure of the memory of Mr. Pitt and the governor of the bank for the time , as to the particulars of a conversation relative to a matter of this nature , which had passed between them not a month before they were called to speak to it ; a matter which afterwards turned out to be a very profitable speculation for the bank . said , the present case was very different from that alluded to by the right hon . gent . ; there was no extension of the charter of the bank in this case ; the advantage of the arrangement was all on the side of the public . The arrangement arose from the suggestions of the Report of the Committee of Finance , submitted to the bank by his majesty 's Ministers , and acceded to with the usual liberality of that institution . In consenting to the motion , he acknowledged he saw no parliamentary ground for producing all the correspondence ; many of the letters referred
