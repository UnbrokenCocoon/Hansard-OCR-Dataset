; to this was added a demand of a lack , and 40,000 rupees for the repairs of the fort of Allahabad . Nor was this all ; we had went two embassies to Persia to counteract the views of Zemaun Shah in Hindostan ; half of the expence was demanded of the nabob : emptied as his coffers had been by our previous extortions , we were in hopes these demands would wholly exhaust them ; or , at least , that they would draw forth from the nabob some acknowledgment of inability to pay them , which might found the pretence of seizing his dominions . And on his remonstrating against the injustice and extent of these demands , and the time and manner in which they were brought forward , and expressed his anxiety , lest such vast and reiterated demand ; made at the same moment , `` should occasion a failure in payment , '' and by that means `` his responsibility should be in peached : '' the governor-general eagerly seizes on `` this possible inability to discharge his engagements with the company , '' ( as he is pleased to term it ) as the foundation of a demand , the most unjust and tyrannical , but which was always the ultimate object of the government . The resident is directed to propose to the nabob , either 1st . The complete transfer of his whole authority , civil and military , to the company ; or , 2dly . Territorial cessions in perpetual sovereignty , equivalent to subsidy and the charges of the augmented force , and this under the seventh article of the treaty of Luchnow , an article which could relate to nothing more than the subsidy settled by that treaty , which was 76 lacks of rupees , not to the augmented demand of upwards of 54 lacks more For a long time the nabob firmly resisted both these iniquitous propositions ; and it was not till he was informed that his further resistance would be ineffectual , that he chose the least degrading of them.— Sir , the noble lord 1102 ( Folkestone ) has detailed the particulars of this transaction ; the insulting language , and the wean artifices by which it was effected . He has stated justly the enormity of the security taken of 62 lacks for every 10 of subsidy , on the principle of the treaty with the rajah of Tanjore ; he has pointed out to you the unworthy conduct of the resident , the humiliation of the nabob ; I shall not repeat the disgusting detail , so injurious to the reputation and honour of G. Britain . But I may just be permitted to ask on what principle of fairness we can accuse the nabob of artifice and duplicity : we who , during the whole transaction , in our instructions to our resident , made use of every little subterfuge , every pitiful pretext to cover our intentions ; who , when we failed in persuading the nabob to surrender his dominions wholly to the Company , instead of abdicating in favour of his son according to his own proposal , instructed our resident to avow the indifference of the Company to an act we had most at heart , and directed him to remove every idea from the mind of the nabob , that we anxiously wished him to abdicate ; we , who when we marched our augmented force into Oude , stated the situation of Rohilcund , and the success of Gholaum Khader , as the pretexts for their march , acknowledging at the time that they were but pretexts.— With what face then can we accuse the nabob of duplicity ? —I shall always think , sir , that if the policy of our government in India was to strengthen our north western frontier by the possession of the Doab , and by the dismemberment of Oude , and the extension of our territory in India ( a policy I much doubt ) it would have been more manly , more becoming the character and
