he examined it in reference to national law , and here it was extremely important not to confound the law of retaliation with the law of self-preservation . The latter was paramount to all laws , and might justify even such a horrible act as the attack upon Copenhagen , provided the case was clearly and satisfactorily made out . The right of retaliation on the other hand , could only with justice be exercised upon an enemy , and could not be extended to the detriment of a neutral power . If a neutral power granted certain advantages to the enemy , then we had an undoubted right to insist upon being admitted to the same advantages ; or if a neutral power acquiesced , from weakness , in the demands of the enemy , all that we could in justice require was , that in consequence of this demand the enemy should not be placed in a better situation in regard to her than we were . But we had ho right , because the enemy violated the rights of one neutral , to violate the rights of all neutrals ; for if this principle were once admitted , it would lead to an extension of hostilities over the whole civilized world . He then applied these general principles to the present case . The meaning of the French Decree was , he allowed , to put the ports of G. Britain in a state of blockade ; but if a measure was to be founded upon it by the government of this country , it ought to be directed to its effects , not to the form in which it was expressed . The first question , then , which arose was , whether it had ever been executed against America , or acquiesced in by the government of the United States ? for if it should turn out that it never had been applied to the commerce of America , and that it never had been submitted to by that power , the framers of the Orders in Council had not a foot of ground on which to stand . Now , his lordship asserted , that Denmark , immediately after the Decree was published , received explicit assurances from the French government that it did not go to capture the ships of neutrals trading upon the high seas , but that its object was merely to prescribe the terms on which the ships of foreign nations were to be admitted into the ports of France . The same explanation of the nature and tendency of the Decree was 480 given to America , and as a proof of the sincerity of the explanation , an American vessel , which was carried into a French port , was released by order of their court of admiralty . It was understood in the same manner in Spain , and ship , which was carried into a port of that kingdom , under similar circumstances , was released by order of their court of prizes . But even supposing that the French decree did not admit of this mitigated construction , it would by no means follow that we had a right to publish orders which amounted to a total prohibition of American commerce , till we saw what steps America would take in consequence of it . The government of Denmark had submitted to the decree , which accounted for the spirited note written by his noble friend ( earl Grey ) on the occasion , in reply to a very insolent one that had been received ( p. 402 ) . But , a different language had been held to America , because her conduct was the reverse of that of Denmark ; and because at that time a negotiation was then depending between this country and the United States by which all their differences were likely to be adjusted.â€”Here the noble lord repelled the accusation which had been brought against his two noble friends who negociated the treaty , of their having made any unbecoming concessions in the course of that negociation . He ventured
