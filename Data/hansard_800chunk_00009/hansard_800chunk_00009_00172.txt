fullest information , because the honour of the country was deeply involved in the transaction . The attack of a power , in perfect amity with us , against whom no act of hostility had been alleged , was in itself so questionable a proceeding , that it called for every explanation that it was possible to produce in its justification.—Under circumstances somewhat similar , what was the conduct of the great king of Prussia ? Their lordships would recollect , that during the seven years war he had suddenly marched an army into Saxony , and taken possession of Dresden , the capital of the elector : —but he had not felt that he had done enough to satisfy the world by declaring that he had procured copies of the treaty actually entered into by the king of Poland , then elector of Saxony , for the partition of his dominions ; for , having afterwards obtained possession of the original treaty , he published it at every court in Europe , in order to render his justification complete.—The noble earl said , he had understood , that it was intended to adduce this precedent in favour of the attack upon Copenhagen , but it was now sufficiently evident , that it would not have answered the purpose , as in the one case there was a positive act of aggression on the part of the power attacked , and in the other , no alleged ground of complaint.—He had listened to the noble marquis ( Wellesley ) 359 with the utmost attention . He had the greatest admiration of his talents , and affection for his person ; and if the eloquent speech he had delivered had failed to carry conviction to his mind , he must believe that the opinion he had formed was not to be shaken . There was one part , however , of his noble friend 's statement , which he must acknowledge was calculated to make a considerable impression ; but which , upon examination , would be found untenable . Having nearly abandoned the idea , entertained by many persons who had not taken the trouble to inquire into the subject , of the practicability of an army with stores , ammunition , and cannon , equal to the capture of such a place as Copenhagen , passing upon the ice from Holstein to Zealand , he had stated , that boats might easily be obtained by the French , and the passage of the Belt effected , in ordinary seasons ; for that , in the straits which separated Zealand from the continent , there were no tides ; and that the floating masses of ice , when driven by the wind , had such an effect , that no cruizers could keep their stations ; and that it frequently happened , that when driven off , they were not able to regain them for many weeks . To this Statement , the noble earl said , he would oppose the opinion of the highest naval authority ( lord St. Vincent 's ) in this , or in any other country ; and upon that authority he would venture to assert , that , so far from cruizers not being able to keep their station in the Belt in ordinary seasons , the anchorage was so good as to render it perfectly practicable ; and , by placing gun-boats upon the coast ready to put off , any armament unsupported by a superior naval force might be effectually resisted.—The noble earl said , he was aware , that during the late attack upon the island of Zealand , some few vessels had got over , notwithstanding the vigilance of our cruizers ; but the number was so small , as rather to furnish an argument in favour of his statement than against it . His lordship declared , that no man entertained a higher opinion of the officers employed upon the expedition than he did . He knew their merits , and with many of them had lived in habits of friendship and intimacy ; but , if with such
