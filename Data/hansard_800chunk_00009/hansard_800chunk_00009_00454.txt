them by the law of nations . `` —This Resolution I might also assume without argument , because the law and practice of nations , as they regard the commerce of neutrals in ordinary wars , have been repeatedly and distinctly admitted by the authors of the Orders in question , who have justified them only by the necessity of the extraordinary conjuncture . But as a kind of distinction appeared to me to have been taken the other night between the law of nations and the practice of nations , which last I consider to . be but the evidence of the former , though probably this distinction exists only in . my misapprehension of what was said , I think it my duty to state not only the rights of neutrals , as they are secured by the law of nations , but also the foundation of the law itself which secures them ; because this course of pursuing the subject will enable me to establish a principle which will protect the whole argument we are engaged in , that the law of nations , whatever its provisions shall be found to be , as applicable to the subject before us , can not , when once settled , be altered or dispensed with by any particular state . In addressing ourselves to this great question , let it be remembered , first of all , because it will greatly shorten the discussion , that the law of nations , as it applies to the matter before us , grows entirely out of war : that it can have no existence but in consequence of war , nor any possible application but to a state of war , and , therefore , to say that by a war prerogative in the constitution of any particular government , its executive power , being no more than a branch of that government and without legislative authority ( if legislation itself could reach it ) , to say that its executive power becomes absolute over the rights of neutrals , and may , during war , disregard that conventional law established amongst nations only as a rule during war , would be not only not sound reasoning , but downright vulgar nonsense.—The law of nations , as it regards this subject , is shortly and simply this—That to mitigate as much as possible the calamities and sufferings of warfare , and to confine them to powers belligerent , nations have found it convenient mutually to adopt certain principles , which , like the common law of our own country , have 936 become fixed and settled by usage , confirmed by precedents , and illustrated by the writings of learned men . These principles have also been adverted to , and ratified by treaties between civilized nations in all ages , and it seems admitted to me that this public law , ( but for the conjuncture under which the late Orders in Council are sought to be justified , ) establishes that countries not engaged in war , nor interposing in it , shall not be affected by the differences of contending nations : but , to use the very words of the eminent judge who now presides with so much learning in the Court of Admiralty , `` upon the breaking out of a war , '' I read from the first volume of Dr. Robinson 's Reports , `` it is the right of neutrals to carry on their accustomed trade , with an exception of the particular cases of a trade to blockaded places , or in contraband articles , and of their ships being liable to visitation and search . '' The learned judge afterwards explains the meaning of an accustomed trade in the most correct and satisfactory manner , and which will be found hereafter to be a most material explanation . After stating the inconveniences which war brings upon neutrals , under the most impartial administration of the public law , he remarks , that still the inconveniences are more than fully balanced by the enlargement of their commerce ; `` because , from
