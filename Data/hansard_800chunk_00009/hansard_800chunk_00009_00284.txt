fleet to France ; and certainly that allegation had considerable weight with his mind , as no doubt it had with that of others . But the manner in which this allegation was afterwards sustained , the successive publications which served step after step to fritter away its force , speedily led him to the opinion , that the ground upon which the supporters of the expedition professed to act was utterly untenable.—With regard to the doctrine , that the unfriendly disposition of Denmark towards this country was a justifiable cause of war , the noble lord in the most impressive terms protested against it . According to the law 659 of nations , the noble lord contended , that there were only two legitimate causes of war , namely , the evident disposition of a state to engage in war , or the actual commencement of hostilities . But in pleading for the Danish expedition , its projectors , aware that no one adequate reason could be assigned for their conduct , seemed to look for support to the accumulation of a number of small reasons . They could not certainly maintain that the treaty of Tilsit was the cause of their attack upon Copenhagen , for to that treaty Russia was a party , towards which government they professed an amicable disposition after that attack had terminated . It had been insinuated , that in urging this point he , and those who thought with him , were pleading for the enemy , while , in point of fact , they were pleading the cause of their country , and of their king , whose name had been used to allege that which the enemy had it in his power to contradict , and to contradict with truth . For , as it was now manifest , there were no secret articles or secret arrangements at Tilsit , as had been originally stated , to justify the Danish expedition , credulity itself could no longer attend to any such statement , after the conversation which a noble friend of his had mentioned to have taken place between him and the emperor of Russia ; but if these much talked of secret articles had really existed , or been seriously suspected by ministers to have an existence , it would surely have been natural to look for some allusion to them in the Declaration of our ambassador at Petersburgh , when accounting for the attack upon Denmark . He , however , did not state a word about them ; on the contrary , he alledged that one gentleman had for a long time reason to suspect the intention of the enemy to take possession of the Danish fleet , for the purpose of employing it against this country.—The noble lord explained the object of the motion , which appeared to be much misunderstood by some of the noble lords on the other side . It was by no means proposed that the Danish fleet should be restored under any particular circumstances ; but merely , that in order to facilitate a reconciliation , and with a view to economy also , that it should be kept in such a state as to prevent any obstructions to peace with Denmark , by enabling us to restore it with the least possible expence and difficulty.—After deprecating the principle , that a state of war should cancel moral obligations , or that we 660 should shrink from doing justice lest it should lead to loss , the noble lord proceeded to comment upon the consequences likely to result to us from the nature of our attack upon Copenhagen . So far from destroying , the naval resources of Denmark by that attack , we had , he contended , particularly by the spirit we had produced , contributed to promote and extend those resources . Denmark could easily repair the loss she sustained by the captures we had made . The ports and arsenals were still remaining , with a vast quantity of naval materials , which naturally belonged to her ; and any supply she wanted , she could obtain
