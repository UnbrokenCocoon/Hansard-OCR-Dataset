mediate , it had been said by a noble lord on a former evening , that a mediator was not an umpire . Upon this subject , however , he would quote the authority of an able diplomatist , he meant M. Talleyrand , who , in a report to the 357 French Senate , expressly states , that the ground of refusing the offer of Russia to mediate between France and Austria was , that she was too much a party in the cause to be an impartial mediator . He was so fully convinced from the information which had been communicated , and from the evident state of Europe , of the wisdom and policy of securing the Danish fleet , that he thought ministers , if they had not resorted to that measure , ought to have been arraigned as criminals at their lordships ' bar . rose to give his support to the motion of the noble duke , on account of the extraordinary predicament in which parliament was placed . He conceived , that it never before had happened , that the nation had been engaged in a new war , without the precise ground upon which hostilities had commenced being stated to parliament : whereas , upon the present occasion , the house was not merely without information as to the specific cause of the war ; but his majesty had been advised , both in the Declaration in Answer to the Russian Manifesto , and in the Speech at the opening of the session , to declare a cause for the war with Denmark , which his ministers upon their legs in parliament had been obliged to relinquish.—In the answer to the Russian Manifesto , the expression made use of by his majesty was as follows : `` His majesty feels himself under no obligation to offer any atonement , or apology , to the emperor of Russia , for the expedition against Copenhagen .

'' And again , in the speech at the opening of the session , it was stated by his majesty 's commissioners , that `` they are commanded by his majesty to inform you , that no sooner had the result of the negotiations at Tilsit confirmed the influence and controul of France over the powers of the continent , than his majesty was apprized of the intention of the enemy to combine those powers in a general confederacy , to be directed , either to the entire subjugation of this kingdom , or to imposing upon his majesty an insecure and ignominious peace . `` —The noble earl then proceeded to show by dates , the accuracy of which , he said , could not be questioned , that the expedition against Copenhagen 358 had actually sailed before there was a possibility of any account , even of the existence of the Treaty of Tilsit , being received in this country ; —that it was not a question as to what the articles might have contained , whether they were more or less hostile to our interests ; but , the actual conclusion of any Treaty could not have been known.—Under these circumstances his majesty 's ministers had been driven to the necessity of finding out other reasons for having commenced hostilities ; involving themselves in the strange inconsistency of advising his majesty to assign to Europe and to his parliament a cause of war , which they had totally abandoned in their attempt to justify the measure.—The noble earl said , that even if the constant practice of parliament did not warrant the expectation of official documents being laid upon the table , for the purpose of explaining the ground upon which the country was plunged into a new war , the circumstances he had stated rendered it indispensibly necessary , in this instance . He considered it the more requisite to furnish the
