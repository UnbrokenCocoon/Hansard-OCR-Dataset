of adequate satisfaction ; or in the rare instance of indispensable necessity , involving national destruction , such as in the case of an individual would justify homicide , or destruction of property for self-preservation : and because the observance of this rule should , if possible , be held more sacred by great and powerful nations , it being the very end and object of universal law , to give perfect security to the weakest communities under the shadow of an impartial justice.—Because , The late attack upon Copenhagen , in a season of profound peace with the crown and people of Denmark , and immediately , following the solemn Declaration by the Crown Prince , of his resolution to maintain his neutrality , and to consider any nation as an enemy which should seek to disturb it , would , without some just cause , which in this case is wholly unsupported by proof , be a most manifest and unprincipled departure from the whole system of moral policy and justice , which the British Government had , as above , professed to act upon , inasmuch as any contempt or violation of public law by the Government of France , though it might release Great Britain from all observance of it , as far as regarded such offending belligerent , could not possible destroy or affect its protective sanctions in her intercourses with friendly and peaceable states . On the contrary , it ought to have invested the Law of Nations with a move binding and sacred obligation , since the professed object and justification of our war with France at that very moment was to restore to a suffering world the good faith and security which 34 had been lost by a contempt of its dominion.—Because , information of a projected confederacy between France and Denmark , assumed , without evidence , to have been communicated to ministers through channels which called , on their parts , for inviolable secrecy , might be a foundation for acquitting them from blame , if the question before the house had been the propriety of their acquittal or condemnation , yet it can not possibly justify , in the absence of all proof , an address to his majesty , pronouncing their attack upon Copenhagen to be an act of indispensable duty ; because , giving credit to the declarations of ministers , that they had informations of such projected confederacy , it is impossible for this house to know whether they ought to have been acted upon to so dreadful an extent , without having before it , most precisely and distinctly , the specific nature of such communications , so as to be able to estimate the credit due to them , not only from the facts themselves , but from the situations and characters of the persons by whom they were made.—The conduct , besides , of ministers , in the whole transaction , is in manifest opposition to this principle of the attack . They made no such charge upon Denmark when before Copenhagen , nor even pretended to have invaded her with a cause of war . Their language upon the spot , and even in the Address proposed to his majesty , is the language of regret , a , language utterly inconsistent with the vindication of a proceeding , which Would have been as mild and forbearing against an enemy , as it was barbarous and treacherous against a friend . The position also of Denmark , when the assault was made upon her , is the strongest evidence to resist the presumption of an understanding with France . Her army was in Holstein , which France was menacing , whilst Zealand was left defenceless , and the ships dismantled , at a moment when the consciousness of a treaty or confederacy must have suggested to all the confederating parties , the necessity of concentrating the whole force of Denmark , to defend her capital , and to secure her fleet.—Because , no evidence whatever has been laid before the house , to establish any hostile confederacy between Denmark and France ,
