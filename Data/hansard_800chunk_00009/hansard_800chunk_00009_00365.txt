appeared to be appropriate to the period at which it was spoken , till at length an accumulation of events has brought us to the crisis of our fate . It still remains to be decided , whether that crisis shall lead to the destruction or the salvation of the empire . I profess myself to be of a disposition rather sanguine under the pressure of political difficulties ; and I am so , not only from constitution of mind , but also upon the principle , that no man ought , to enter into the business of public life , without a determination never to despair of the public welfare . Such is the power of true wisdom , when once applied to the conduct of human affairs ; such is what may be termed its vis medicatrix that no situation can be imagined so desperate as not to admit of remedy . It is absolutely necessary , however , to use the time which yet remains , with discretion , and we are in a situation in which no fresh error can be committed with impunity . I have felt it therefore to be my duty at this particular moment , to bring to the recollection of the house the transactions of the last few months , to propose the expression of an opinion upon the conduct of ministers with regard to our foreign relations during the time they have been in power , and a mode of proceeding for the future.—I am not presumptuous enough to imagine , that what I shall submit to your consideration will prove an infallible remedy ; but at the same time I have a right to hope that my advice , if adopted , may probably , or possibly at least , lead to political salvation ; for the experiment which I have in view , has been hitherto absolutely untried . We are at present , in my view and estimate of things , grovelling in error . The country is in a state of delusion , which was at the first artificially created , and has been kept up from time to time for interested purposes , till at last the whole community 802 appears to be , in an alarming degree , the too willing slave of its own prejudices . My object is to dispel these clouds , to lead the house , and the country to the true knowledge of the circumstances in which we stand , to ascertain whether our ruin be inevitable , and our salvation impossible : to induce you to act with justice both to yourselves and others ; that , if it should please God that this great nation should at last be overcome , we may meet our fate with the resolution of men who had done all which depended upon them to avert it ; and that if we do perish , we at least may perish in the light of day.—Sir , I do not intend to bring before the house the distresses of any of our countrymen arising from the war ; and indeed I have refrained from all minute enquiry into the particular embarrassments felt in various of our most important branches of commerce , lest I should be tempted to dwell on the detail of such grievances , and appear to confine the matter now below me to narrow , or to party , grounds ; or to induce the house to adopt a plan of action founded upon that , which of itself would not afford its justification . But there are many symptoms confirming the statement made in the speech of the Lords Commissioners , which it is impossible totally to overlook . The most prominent of them are the petitions , now lying upon your table , praying you to advise his majesty to enter into a negotiation at the first convenient opportunity , and which we are told , have already been signed by no less than from thirty to forty thousand persons . These petitions have this peculiar character about them , that they are the spontaneous expressions of those
