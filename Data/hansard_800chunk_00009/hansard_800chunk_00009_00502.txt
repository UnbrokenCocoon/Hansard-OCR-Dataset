the Mogul government retained its vigour , the vassal chiefs styled nabobs , were appointed only to enforce the orders from Delhi , that the places called fortresses in those districts were intrusted to killedars or governors independent of the nabob , that the collection of the revenues was in the , hands of officers called dewans , alike independent of him , that his emoluments arose from a jaghire or assignment in some other district with which he had no other connection , and that it had been the con- 1006 stant policy of the mogul , to remove nabobs so frequently , in order to prevent , their acquiring hold in their districts , that Mr. Orme tells us , one of them going from Delhi , rode with his face towards the horse 's tail , saying he looked out for his successor . On the decline of the Mogul empire from the contests amongst the successors of Aurengzebe , and after its being completely broke down by the invasion of Nadir Shaw , who carried away 100 millions sterling from Delhi and massacred 100,000 of its inhabitants , the power of coercing the several provinces and districts which composed the vast mass of the Mogul empire , no longer existing , they fell into the hands of those chiefs whom a modern periodical reviewer has emphatically and truly described as victorious assassins , consummate traitors , and experienced robbers more skilled in breaking than in making treaties , and less formidable from their swords than their daggers . And after a disgusting repetition of assassinations , poisonings , and putting out of eyes , the boldest and most fortunate having the power of the sword in their hands , and no superior sword to control them , assumed all those powers which under the mogul had been studiously kept separate and declared their possessions hereditary . As long as the Mogul empire continued in vigour , a British factory at Calcutta carried on a profitable mercantile concern , in consequence of valuable privileges conceded in return for important medical relief rendered to the mogul and the nabob of Bengal by superior European skill . After its decline , during the progress of the subsequent transactions , the British factory , notwithstanding frequent exactions of the chiefs , still carried on a valuable commerce in consequence of the privileges that were left to them . But on the accession of a ferocious youth to the succession of a victorious assassin and consummate traitor , who not many years before became nabob of Bengal , the opinion of the opulence of the British factory roused his avarice , and with a mighty rabble he invested Calcutta . After a feeble attempt to defend the settlement , the greatest number of the Europeans sheltered themselves on board their ships , and about 150 remained in the fort . In a few days those in the fort surrendered on capitulation for their lives ; but this ferocious youth disappointed in what he found in the settlement , ordered them to be confined , with the view of ex- 1007 torting treasure which he imagined they had concealed , about 147 were forced into 2 dungeon for the night 20 feet square , out of which the following morning 26 were brought out alive.â€”When an account of this desperate state of the British interests in Bengal , was brought to Madras , which was then the superior presidency , they determined to divert a force , which had been prepared for another purpose , to the attempt to relieve Bengal . Fortunately for his country a man who had distinguished himself by repeated military and political talents , was selected for the command , and col. Clive , was sent with it . With this force and the cordial and gallant co-operation of admiral Watson with the British squadron , they forced the nabob 's numberless rabble to evacuate the settlement , and following them in their retreat , after a fruitless negotiation with the nabob , but securing the cooperation of Meer Jaffier , one of the chiefs who knew
