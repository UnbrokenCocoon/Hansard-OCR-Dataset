, and have precedence of the others ; because , as your lordships will presently see , the Resolutions have a dependence upon one another , and we begin with a declaration against the dispensing and suspending powers of the crown , dead and buried as they were at the revolution , because we affirm that his majesty 's ministers have nevertheless advised the king to assume them , and that the Orders in Council are a positive and dangerous assumption of it.—The first Resolution declares , `` That the power of making laws to bind the people of this realm is exclusively vested in his majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal , and commons of the realm , in parliament assembled ; and that every attempt to make , alter , suspend , or repeal such laws , by order of his majesty in his privy council , or in any other manner , than by his majesty in parliament , is unconstitutional and illegal . `` —The second Resolution declares , `` That the advising his majesty to issue any Order in Council , for dispensing with , or suspending , any of the laws of this realm , is a high violation of the fundamental laws and constitution thereof That the same can not in any case be justified , but by some unforeseen and urgent necessity endangering the public safety . And that in every such case it is the duty of his majesty 's ministers to advise his majesty , after issuing such order , forthwith to assemble his parliament , in order both that the necessity of such proceeding may be inquired of and determined ; and that due provision may be made for the public safety , by the authority of his majesty in parliament . '' — My lords , the sound policy of the constitution , asserted in the last member of this Resolution , was , perhaps , never so strikingly illustrated as upon the present occasion . His majesty 's ministers , though placed in a conjuncture which they themselves admit to have been wholly without example ; though they were engaging in a proceeding for which , of course , they had neither precedent nor analogy to direct them ; though , from the measure they were adopting , not only our commerce . was to suffer a sudden and universal revolution , but , from its probable reception by America , we were to risque 933 the alliance of a powerful and numerous people , and thereby complete the combination of the whale world against our country : yet they not only did not call parliament together for its counsel , on an occasion so new and so difficult , but even prevented , it from assembling , by repeated prorogations . Was parliament thus repeatedly prorogued because the measure was within the king 's power , and because they had so considered it in all its bearings that the assistance of parliament was unnecessary ? My lords , it was a manifest extension of the king 's power , as I shall soon demonstrate to your lordships ; and had it even been clearly within it , the subject was not only too complicated for the private councils of the crown , but ministers had not at all considered even its certain consequences and effects , nor was the subject indeed within the reach of the most enlightened statesman , without the aids which committees of parliament could have furnished : —the truth of this observation is best supported by the fact . They issued the first Order , though it was to have its operation upon distant nations , without the notices which , in less than a week afterwards , they acknowledged to have been indispensible ; and they suffered it to find its way , in the gazettes , in that unjust and imperfect state , to every port in America . They were then surrounded by the merchants of London ( I wish the siege had been continued ) , and were obliged to
