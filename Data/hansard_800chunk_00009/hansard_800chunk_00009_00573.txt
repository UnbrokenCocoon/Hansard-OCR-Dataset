protracted war ) from the inadequacy of his force to cover the whole of a weak and extensive frontier , he must necessarily have left many parts of the country exposed to the irruption of the Mahratta army.—In consequence , however , of the introduction of the company 's authority into those provinces , lord Lake was not only enabled to draw his supplies from them , but to apply the whole of his force to the attack of the enemy , and thus he finished , in one campaign , a war which might otherwise have been protracted to a period of several years.—These were a , part of the advantages resulting from that territorial cession , a demand for which he Maintained not only to have been justifiable , not only conformable to the spirit of the stipulations contained in the treaty of 1798 , but absolutely necessary to our security . The vizier had repeatedly intimated to the resident , his apprehension of a total failure in the resources of the country , and in proportion as it was essential to the interests of the company , and of the vizier , that a large British military force should be , permanently stationed in Oude , in the same proportion was it necessary , that the resources by which that force was to be maintained , should be preserved from failure . And , considering all the circumstances detailed in the papers upon the table , of the radical defects of the vizier 's system of administration , of the mutinous spirit , and total want of dis 1115 cipline prevailing in his army , of the annual progressive decline of the revenues and resources of every description , and of the existence of a formidable French establishment , permanently stationed upon the most vulnerable part of our frontier ; he repeated , that , under such circumstances , the governor-general , whoever he might be , would not only have been unworthy of the trust reposed in him , but would have been guilty of a criminal neglect of his duty , if he had not taken effectual means for placing the company 's interests in Oude , as connected with those of the vizier , upon a permanent foundation of security . The arrangement , as it now stands , has proved equally advantageous to both parties . The company no longer depends for the regular discharge of the subsidy upon the precarious realization of the revenues . On the other hand , the vizier , with a diminished territory , had , in a pecuniary view , derived a considerable advantage . For , although the districts ceded to the company , were rated at a crore and 35-lacks of rupees , it appeared , upon an examination of the account of the aumils of the several districts ceded , that not more than 90 lacks had ever been paid into the vizier 's treasury from those districts ; consequently , he was a gainer of more than forty lacks of rupees annually by the new arrangement.—The noble lord ( Folkestone ) had stated , in his Resolutions , that in pursuing this measure , lord Wellesley was actuated by motives of ambition and aggrandizement . But he positively knew , that he pursued the whole progress of this arrangement with a degree of personal labour , solicitude , and anxiety , almost unparalleled , under a conviction that his duty required the steps Which he took , and that he was acting in a most important and urgent case , not only for the advantage , but for the very existence of the interests committed to his charge . He also acted under a conviction , that his proceedings were consonant to the wishes and intentions of his employers at home ; nor did he receive the least intimation , not even a hint , that his measures in Oude were disapproved by the court of directors , until his return to England in 1806 , more than four years subsequent to the conclusion of the treaty .
