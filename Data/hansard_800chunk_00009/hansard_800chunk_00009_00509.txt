did when he possesesd those ceded districts subject to the payment of an inferior subsidy , and at the same time the comfort and security of those millions who were formerly oppressed and pillaged , by his numerous armed rabble , is materially improved . In the ceded districts , by those Zemindars who , possessed of troops and strong forts , were accustomed to dictate their own terms to the weakness of the vizier 's government , much opposition was made to the .establishment of the company 's government , and it is to be lamented in some instances much blood has been spilt . Such feudal anarchy was incompatible with safety and good order ; as it shewed itself , it has been subdued by the vigour and discipline of the British arms ; and the lenity and beneficence of those British institutions which from 1786 have progressively increased the happiness and prosperity of the Bengal provinces , have been introduced . Much time had not elapsed , before an opportunity occurred for the vizier to shew his feelings as to the change in his situation , and for the inhabitants of as important ceded district to shew what they felt . During the contest with the Mahrattas , a difficulty arising from a delay of supply of 1017 money and other requisites for the advance of the company 's army , the nabob vizier voluntarily came forward with a considerable loan without interest , and assisted with all the resources of his country . On the incursion of a formidable Pitan chief into the ceded district whereof he was a native , where he had powerful connections , and where formerly he would have found Much co-operation , so few chewed themselves inclined to him , that he thought it prudent to retreat , doing but inconsiderable mischief . Another tempting occasion offered for the nabob to show dissatisfaction , if he had not experienced advantage from the new treaty , when , upon the proposal from a servant of the company ( who was on his return to this country , and was supposed to have powerful connections here , ) to be appointed his agent for the purpose of representing and obtaining redress of those hardships which he imagined the nabob vizier felt from the act of the British government ; the nabob declined his interference , and testified by his conduct , feelings of a direct opposite nature . From all these circumstances , it can scarcely be doubted , but that he would think himself little obliged to those hon . gentlemen in this house who have advocated his cause , as they think , with so much zeal and eloquence , if they succeeded in putting him back into his former situation . The external political effects of this great measure may be appreciated by the facilities which it afforded to that energy of counsel , and exertion of military talents , by which , in a few months , fortresses deemed impregnable were taken by storm ; arsenals filled with all military implements according to the European system of war , were seized ; an army consisting of between 30 and 40,000 men , not such rabble as have hitherto composed a native army , but of troops formed and trained during many years in European tactics by M. de Roigne , but then under French influence ; supported by a great superiority of compleat well served artillery ; maintained by large revenues arising , from provinces in their possession which led into the heart of your dominions , compleatly annihilated ; in consequence of which you are now in possession of those arsenals , arid revenues of those provinces ; and what is not less important you have rescued the person of the mogul from that French influence which knew well how to employ his name to your detriment . Those who have had the means of 1018 best knowing the respective circumstances and localities of the countries in question , are convinced that had not this arrangement with the nabob vizier taken place , the increased difficulties must have
