and acquisition of territory , in direct opposition to the established policy of the East India company ; —that he pursued this object by means offensive , and with a spirit irritating to the nabob , with a total disregard of the recorded opinions of this house , and the provisions of two several acts of parliament ; and that he finally succeeded in wresting from this unfortunate prince , against his will , a large portion of his territory , and in depriving him of all effective government over the remainder ; in direct violation of every principle of good faith , equity , and justice , and in open breach of the sacred obligation of a solemn treaty ; and that he has thereby affixed a lasting stigma and reproach on the British name and character , and contributed to destroy all confidence in the moderation , justice , and good faith of the British government in India . '' The first Resolution having been read from the Chair , rose and said : — Sir ; The noble lord has informed the house , that the Resolutions he has moved , are founded on the information he has drawn from the documents which have been laid before it to illustrate the transactions that took place in the province of Oude , during the administration of lord Wellesley . I by no means agree that those documents bear out these Resolutions , on the contrary , to my conviction they justify the very reverse . But , sir , what has induced me at this moment to obtrude myself on the house , is a persuasion that in order to form a sound opinion on this important subject , it is necessary to go much deeper into it than the noble lord has thought proper to do . I apprehend every gentleman will agree that ascertaining what has been the real relation between the British nation through its represen- 1005 tative the India Company and the province of Oude , and what are the duties and rights respectively belonging to it and the native chiefs , with whom it has been involved , since it was forced to emerge into a territorial from being a mercantile concern , ought to save much time , as whatever may he said which does not apply to these relations may be very good declamation , but is not argument . Appeals to its humanity and justice have always , and I trust ever will be favourably received , but when those appeals are made , it becomes the good sense of this house to examine carefully the grounds , least their heads should be the dupes of their hearts , and intending humanity and justice should produce results directly opposite . I conceive for this salutary purpose it is necessary to trace the origin and progress of the British connections in India , and knowing the apathy this house , unfortunately for the publick , has shewn on those subjects , I shall take up as little of its time , as the nature of that investigation will admit . As anonymous , and unacknowledged publications , bold assertions gratuitously advanced in this house or out of this house , can have no effect on its good sense , I beg leave to state that the opinions I entertain on this great subject are drawn from the series of facts recorded by Mr. Orme in his history of the wars sustained by the British company and nation in Bengal and the Carnatick , and from Mr. Verelst 's account of the rise and progress of the British company in Bengal . The works of these two gentlemen having been before the public 50 years , and having been stamped with the character of truth and impartiality by a great majority of the principal actors in those scenes and of their successors , I conceive , will be admitted indisputable authority ; it is to be regretted , that with their means and talents they did not continue their labours to a later period . It appears from their authorities that while
