faithful commons , always desirous of supporting the dignity of his majesty 's crown , and the faith of engagements contracted by his majesty with foreign powers , will make good the Subsidy granted by his majesty to the king of Sweden . Nevertheless , his majesty 's faithful commons feel it be their duty , to represent to his majesty ; that in the present state of the contest with his majesty 's enemies , his faithful commons would have been better satisfied to have answered such calls for pecuniary aid as his majesty might have thought expedient to make upon this house , for the purpose of assisting the king of Sweden , under such exigences as his fidelity to G. Britain may bring upon him , rather than to make any grant resulting from the terms of a specific convention . Humbly to represent to his majesty , that his faithful commons have seen , with great concern , by the 3d Article of the Convention with the king of Sweden , which his majesty has been most graciously pleased to direct should be laid upon the table of this house , that his majesty has bound himself 'not to conclude any peace or truce , or convention of neutrality with the enemy , except in concert and by mutual agreement with the king Of Sweden . ' A species of engagement , which , as it appears to his majesty 's faithful commons , ought never to be entered into excepting upon the most mature deliberation , and when the relative-situation of the contracting parties is far different 1167 from that in which G. Britain and Sweden now stand . That the experience of such contracts , made in the course of the late war with France , tend to prove that they can not be binding on the weaker of the two contracting parties , because no manner of obligation can bind a state to its utter ruin ; and in the peculiar situation in which Sweden now stands , it appears to this house , but too probable , that all the efforts of his majesty may not be sufficient to preserve her from submission to her enemies , whilst , on the other hand , the perseverance of Sweden in the contest , can in no way be beneficial to G. Britain , and the article in question may throw difficulties in the way of negociation for the restoration of the blessings of peace.—To represent to his majesty the surprize of this house , at not finding in the Treaty submitted to its consideration , any Article of Commercial Regulation between the two countries . His majesty 's ministers having represented to this house , that the best hope of success , in the present contest , depended upon certain measures affecting the commerce of neutral nations , which are manifestly and avowedly impracticable without the co-operation of Sweden . It was natural to expect , that at a time when Sweden is to be defended with the blood and treasure of G. Britain , some stipulation should have been required from her , that she would not render totally ineffectual the measure which his majesty 's ministers have repeatedly declared to be most efficacious , now remaining to be used against France.—That his majesty 's faithful commons are the more disappointed at this omission in the present Treaty , because by the 5th Article of the Secret Convention entered into between his majesty and the king of Sweden , and signed at Stockholm on the 3d of Dec. 1804 , it appears that commercial arrangements had become matter of discussion between the two powers , and that 'New points , whereby the commercial interests of the two countries might be more closely connected , were reserved for a particular act . '—ln these circumstances his majesty 's faithful commons do freely grant to his majesty the supply necessary to make good the promise of his majesty 's royal word , but at the same time they deeply lament , that such engagements should have been entered into as may tend to embarrass
