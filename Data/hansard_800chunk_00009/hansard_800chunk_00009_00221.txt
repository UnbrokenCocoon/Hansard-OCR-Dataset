the field of battle , and immediately after made themselves masters of the magazines at Elbing , and returned to their cantonments , where they effectually covered the blockade of several strong towns , which afterwards surrendered to them . At that time the king of Prussia retired from Konigsberg to Memel , and not thinking himself quite safe there , had even engaged a house at Riga . On the 23d of Feb. he wrote to ministers , mentioning that a French general had arrived at Memel to propose a separate peace ; and if the count de Zastrow supported the idea of a separate peace , it was not because he was less attached than any other man to the cause of Prussia and the continent , but because he knew the situation of Russia and Prussia , and was convinced that they had no chance by continuing the contest . In the beginning of April he had had a long conversation with the emperor of Russia , who afterwards referred him to one of his ministers , who told him , that as soon as the Russian guards came up they would be superior in number to the French , and were determined to attack them . The Russians neither knew the force that opposed them , nor how much their own numbers in the field were inferior to their armies upon paper.â€”The noble lord was then proceeding to state the nature of different dispatches between him and the present ministers , when rose to order . He thought it was completely out of order for any noble lord to state , at his own pleasure , all the conversations between kings and emperors , which , from his official situation , he might have heard , or to divulge the confidential communications which took place between him and his government ; and if it was competent for any one individual to do so , it was equally competent for any other individual in his majesty 's service . said , that whether the noble lord acted right or not in entering into these details , they were completely relevant to the question under dis- 444 cussion , and therefore that he could not be said to be out of order . wished to know whether their lordships would submit to the doctrine , that it was quite regular , as had been done in another place , to read partial extracts from correspondence , where , by stopping short in the middle of a sentence , the meaning was altogether perverted , and that they should be debarred from the privilege of rectifying the false impressions to which this conduct had given rise ? And he would ask , whether it was for those who had themselves set the example of publishing garbled extracts from official papers , which of all others ought to be considered as the most secret and confidential , to complain of his noble friend , particularly when it was recollected that he deemed it absolutely necessary to the justification of his own character , which had been most wantonly and falsely aspersed ? reminded the noble lord that it was a great breach of order in that house to refer or allude to any thing which had passed in another house of parliament . And if a breach of order had been committed and permitted in another place ; that was surely no reason why a similar breach of order should be tolerated by their lordships . He was clearly of opinion , that it was disorderly in any person who had been employed in a public capacity to read a part , or to disclose the contents of a public dispatch , without the leave of his majesty , to whom that dispatch was supposed to belong ; and he thought that they had already gone a very dangerous length in allowing a minute of a conversation , supposed to have passed between an accredited minister and a foreign sovereign , without his majesty 's permission to that effect . contended that his noble friend was not reading a dispatch
