assure his majesty , that , in this important conjuncture of affairs , he will find in us the same determination with which his majesty himself is animated , to support the honour of his crown , and the just rights and interests of his people ; and humbly to thank his majesty , for having been graciously pleased to inform us that as soon as the result of the Negotiation at Tilsit had confirmed the influence and controul of France over the powers of the continent , his majesty was apprized that it was the intention of the enemy to combine those powers in one general confederacy ; that such confederacy was to be directed either to the intire subjugation of his majesty 's kingdom , or 42 to the imposing upon his majesty an insecure and ignominious peace ; and that , for this purpose , it was determined to force into hostilities against his majesty , states which had hitherto been allowed by France to maintain or to purchase their neutrality , and to bring to bear against different parts of his majesty 's dominions , the whole naval force of Europe , and specifically the fleets of Portugal and Denmark ; and humbly to assure his majesty , that we concur with his majesty in thinking , that , under those circumstances , the placing of those fleets out of the reach of such a confederacy , became an object of essential and indispensable necessity for the security of his majesty 's dominions : —That while we feel perfectly convinced , from the knowledge we have of the natural generosity of his majesty 's mind , that it must have been with the greatest reluctance that his majesty , in pursuing this important object , so far as related to the Danish Fleet , felt himself compelled ( when his majesty 's endeavours to open a Negotiation with the court of Denmark had failed ) , to order his commanders to resort to the extremity of force ; we at the same time most heartily congratulate his majesty upon the success which attended the execution of this most painful but necessary service : —That we learn , with great satisfaction , that the object which his majesty had to accomplish , with respect to the Fleet of Portugal , was happily attainable in a manner more congenial to his majesty 's feelings ; and . that the timely and unreserved communication , by the court of Lisbon , of the demands and designs of France , confirming to his majesty the authenticity of the ad-vices which his majesty is graciously pleased to state that he had received from other quarters , naturally entitled that court to an entire confidence on the part of his majesty , in the sincerity of the assurances by which that communication was accompanied , as well as to every degree of forbearance compatible with the ultimate and indispensable object of security to his majesty 's dominions : —And to offer to his majesty our most hearty congratulations , that this confidence and forbearance of his majesty have been justified by the event ; and that the fleet which had been destined as the instrument of vengeance against Great Britain has been preserved from the grasp of France , and is now employed in conveying to its American possessions the hopes and fortunes of the Portuguese mo- 43 narchy ; joining with his majesty in imploring the blessings of Divine Providence upon that great enterprise , and rejoicing in the preservation of a power so long the ally of Great Britain , and in the prospect of its establishment in the new World in augmented strength and splendour : —To lament , in common with his majesty , that the determination , on the part of the enemy , to excite hostilities between his majesty and his late allies , the emperors of Russia and of Austria , and the king of Prussia , have proved so successful ; and to concur with his majesty in the propriety of his not having accepted the proffered mediation of the emperor of Russia ,
