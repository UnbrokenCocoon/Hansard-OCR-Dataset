to any individual state to add to the law of nations by its own arbitrary ordinances , without the concurrence of other states ; and he concludes thus—On the whole , therefore , I am of opinion , that , though we should have been concluded by the sentence , if the ship , contrary to justice , had been condemned as not being Danish , yet as the court abroad has endeavoured to give other supports to its judgment which do not warrant it , and have stated , as the foundation of the sentence of condemnation , one of their own ordinances , which is not binding on other nations , this sentence does not prove that the ship in question was not a neutral ship , '—The language of that truly eminent judge , Mr. Justice Lawrence , is no less remarkable ; because , in agreeing with lord Kenyon , he refers to the state paper in the Collectiana Juridica , signed by sir George Lee , Dr. Paul , the king 's Advocate , and sir Dudley Ryder and lord Mansfield , then attorney and solicitor general , 953 which I shall presently have occasion to refer to , and which is absolutely conclusive upon the doctrine I am maintaining.—In the other case of Bird and Appleton , which is the last I shall refer to , and which followed in a few terms after the other , lord Kenyon declared , that he adhered to the opinion he had before delivered , and maintained , as an indisputable proposition , 'that Courts of Admiralty are to proceed according the jus gentium , or on the treaties between particular states ; that even such treaties do not alter the jus gentium , with respect to the rest of the world ; and that one state has no authority , by ordinances of its own , to vary the general law of nations as to other states . '—Now , my lords , unless there was a fixed , settled , and known law of nations , which judges , as learned men , could refer to , and by which they were bound to regulate their decisions , how is it possible that these judgments could have been pronounced ? and would they not apply equally to arbitrary condemnations of your own Court of Admiralty , if they came , in the same manner , before them ? I have the highest authority , as well as the reason of the thing , to maintain that they certainly would ; because lord Hale , speaking of the Court of Admiralty , says , 'the jurisdiction of this court is not founded bottomed upon the authority of the civil law , but bath both its power and jurisdiction by the law and custom of the realm , and the common law judges have the exposition of such statutes as concern the extent of the jurisdiction of these courts , whether ecclesiastical or maritime . ' The law of nations , therefore , as administered in our prize courts , is part of the law of the land.—My lords , the passage in the Answer to the Prussian Memorial , which I said I would refer to , is an unanswerable confirmation of the doctrine that the law of nations can not be altered by a particular state . Those eminent judges , in the name of his majesty , answer the Prussian objection thus : 'By Courts of Admiralty , according to the law of nations , all captures at sea have been immemoriably judged of in every country of Europe . '—And again : 'Had it been intended to introduce any variation from the law of nations , it could only be done by a treaty in writing . The parties interested , and the Court of the Admiralty , could not otherwise take notice of it . ' But this is not the doctrine alone of the common law judges and of eminent law- 954 yers and civilians giving their opinions to the crown ; it stands upon the most undoubted authority of the
