be presented to his majesty , to assure his majesty , that his faithful commons , anxious that justice should at all times be done to the upright views which direct his majesty 's conduct towards other powers , are desirous of warding off a suspicion , however groundless , that the late attack of Copenhagen was made less with a view of averting an immediate and pressing danger , than for the purpose of permanently appropriating to the use of this country a great increase of naval means : that his faithful commons observe that his majesty , not imputing hostile designs to the king of Denmark , but apprehensive lest he should not be able to resist the attack about to be made on him by France for the purpose of getting possession of his fleet and arsenal , was willing in the first instance to enter into negotiations with him , and to agree to take his fleet in deposit until the restoration of peace , and that it was only after all proposals to that effect had been rejected that operations were commenced for the purpose of securing it by force of arms : that his faithful commons humbly submit to his majesty , that it was hardly to be expected that an independent sovereign should consent to acknowledge by a public instrument his inability to defend his territory and capital ; and that therefore it is by no means a matter of wonder that he should reject the proposal so offered to him : that he should endeavour to repel the attack made on him to enforce it , and by a declaration of war resent and attempt to revenge it , when the attack proved successful : that his majesty 's faithful commons therefore trust that his majesty , making due allowance for the feelings which may fairly be supposed to have actuated the court of Denmark on this occasion , will not be induced , by any acts of hostility thus provoked , to forget the terms which his majesty first offered , and which seem to be all that the necessity of the case , and the safety of his dominions , required ; and that he will still be ready to fulfil them on his part , whenever the restoration of peace , and the state of the continental powers of Europe , hold out a fair and legitimate hope that by so king he will not be in 1286 fact adding to the means and naval resources of France : that his majesty 's faithful commons believe and hope that such a conduct , as it will be perfectly in unison with the moderate and disinterested views which his majesty entertains , so it will make manifest to Europe , that while the enemy is actuated by views of ambition , aggrandizement , and conquest , his majesty will never he irritated by his example , nor induced by the possession of power , wantonly to attack the independence of other nations ; that his sole wish is to obtain for himself and his people security and repose ; and that if in the pursuit of these objects he is ever unfortunately compelled to adopt measures contrary to the interest of those states with which he is desirous of maintaining the relations of peace , he will yet seize the earliest opportunity , consistent with the honour of his crown and the safety of his dominions , to heal the wounds which he may have involuntarily given , and to make reparation for the injury which , in defending his rights against the unjust attacks of the enemy , he may have been necessitated to inflict . '' expressed much regret , at seeing so thin an attendance upon a discussion of so much importance . Upon the question of the Copenhagen expedition , he had all along differed with those with whom he was in the habit of agreeing upon most political questions . He thought that expedition justifiable upon every principle of national and public law ; but the grounds of defence which had been adopted by his
