The Second Session of the Fourth Parliament of the United Kingdom was opened this day , by commission ; the commissioners were , the archbishop of Canterbury , the lord chancellor , and the earls Camden , Aylesford , and Dartmouth . At three o'clock the lords commissioners took their seats upon the woolsack ; and the Commons , pursuant to message , having attended , with their Speaker , at the bar , the Lord Chancellor informed them , that his Majesty had been pleased to direct his commission to certain lords , therein named , to open the session ; which commission they should hear read , and afterwards his majesty 's most gracious Speech . The commission was then read by the clerk at the table ; after which , the Lord Chancellor read the Speech , as it here follows : `` My Lords and Gentlemen , `` We have received his majesty 's commands to assure you , that in calling you together at this important conjuncture of affairs , he entertains the most perfect conviction , that he shall find in you the same determination with which his majesty himself is animated , to uphold the honour of his crown , and the just rights and interests of his people.—We are commanded by his majesty to inform you , that no sooner 2 had the result of the Negotiations at Tilsit confirmed the influence and controul of France over the powers of the continent , than his majesty was apprized of the intention of the enemy to combine those powers in one general confederacy , to be directed either to the entire subjugation of this kingdom , or to the imposing upon his majesty an insecure and ignominious peace.—That , for this purpose , it was determined to force into hostility against his majesty , states which had hitherto been allowed by France to maintain or to purchase their neutrality , and to bring to bear against different points of his majesty 's dominions the whole of the Naval Force of Europe ; and specifically the Fleets of Portugal and Denmark .
