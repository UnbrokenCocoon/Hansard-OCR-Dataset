complain , nor any cause of complaint . It is true , that the territory over which he seemed to reign was greatly curtailed ; its extent being reduced , in fact , to one half , and that much against his inclination at the moment ; but the circumstances of the transaction were such as to add greatly to his comfort ; for being relieved from the burden of a heavy tribute , and from the expence of maintaining a great army , his net annual income was left as great , at least as before , being to the amount of 1,200,000l . sterling yearly , free from all charges , and perfectly at his own disposal.—His political consequence may seem to have been impaired ; but he had , in reality , nothing political to lose . The documents before the house sufficiently prove that the nabob of Oude , as well as all these protected princes of India , possess only an apparent sovereignty ; that they have been raised to this elevated station by us , merely to serve our own purpose , to overawe the natives , and to facilitate the collection of the revenues ; that without the assistance of our military force these princes could not maintain their station for a single month ; that though treaties have been entered into with them worded in the language usually employed between equal and independent states , these seem , by mutual understanding , to have been considered as nugatory , and have been disregarded by every successive governor-general , whenever they stood in the way of the public service.—Some very striking anecdotes , stated in evidence by major Ouseley , shew clearly that Saadut Ali himself , after the first shock was over , which his pride underwent during the arrangement at Lucknow , saw the matter in the same light . These anecdotes prove , not only that he acquiesced , but that he acquiesced cheerfully in all that had been settled . Sir James H stated that with no bias in favour of the noble marquis , he had felt himself called upon to look , for the first time , into the affairs of India , in order to form an impartial judgment on the question before the house . In examining the secret correspondence carried on 1144 between Lucknow and Calcutta during the negotiation which ended in the arrangement of 1801 , he had met with very ample confirmations of the favourable opinion , entertained by the public , of lord Wellesley 's talents ; and he found at the same time , what the public voice had not led him to expect , that in carrying through these measures with firmness and sometimes with severity , the marquis never lost sight of what could tend to conciliation ; that when the points , essential to the public service , were galled , he exerted himself strenuously and effectually in rendering the charges palatable to the nabob himself , to his family , his nobles , and his disbanded army . So for therefore from having incurred blame by his conduct in Oude , lord Wellesley appeared to have a double claim to the thanks of his country , by achieving the most arduous public services , and by , at the same time , healing those wounds which great political changes and revolutions , however beneficial to the public , seldom fail to inflict on individuals . thought the question now before the house of such importance , as to interest the feelings of every member . The chief object of the resolutions moved by a noble lord was to impeach a distinguished character not in that house . The noble marquis who was the object of these resolutions , had received great honours , both from his majesty , from his country , and from the court of directors , for the very same conduct which it was now wished to make the ground of parliamentary censure . The noble marquis was charged with crimes of no common magnitude , he was charged with tyranny , breach
