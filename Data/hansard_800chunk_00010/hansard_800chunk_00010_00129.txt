sixteenth part , or thereabouts , has been consumed in the distilleries , they can not doubt that such a change of culture might take place as would prevent barley from being reduced below its proportionable price , compared with other grain , or , if it should for a time be somewhat lower than its just proportion , it would soon , in the opinion of the petitioners , find a more extended consumption as bread corn , the effect of which must inevitably be to raise it to its natural level ; in confirmation of which the petitioners are enabled to state to the house , that of late , in consequence of the advance of wheat and oats , as well as the reduction of wages , the lower classes in the county of Lancaster have begun to have recourse to barley bread , which they are not accustomed to use , except in times of scarcity and comparative dearness of other sorts of grain ; and that the petitioners conceive the confining the operation of the measure in question to a single year , with a power vested in his majesty in council to put an end to it within that period if necessary , would be so guarded a proceeding as not to cause in the minds of those concerned the least feeling of alarm or apprehension ; and that , although the petitioners are anxious to recommend the proposed measure to the house on grounds of general benefit , without reference to any partial interests , yet they can not be insensible of its tendency to afford relief to the West Indian colonies in their present distressed situation , which has been shewn to have peculiar claims on the considera- 257 tion of the legislature , and which , in the apprehension of the petitioners , affords a strong additional argument in favour of this measure , more especially as the preservation of the colonies from the ruin which threatens them is confessedly an object of the first national importance , as it appears the article of sugar alone pays an annual duty of above three millions to the country ; that the manufactured goods exported annually to these colonies have exceeded six millions in value ; and that this trade is one of the principal remaining nurseries for our seamen and of employment for our shipping ; and therefore praying , that the house will pass an act to suspend the use of grain in the distilleries of Great Britain and Ireland , and to confine them to the use of sugar , for one year , from the first day of July next , subject to a discretionary power to be vested in the king in council , upon a sufficient notice , to do away the suspension , and allow the distilleries to carry on their trade in the accustomed manner . `` â€”Ordered to lie upon the table . presented a Petition from certain of the clergy resident in the county of Berks , taking notice of the Bill for making more effectual provision for the maintenance of Stipendiary Curates in England , and for their residence on their cures ; and setting forth , `` That the petitioners , impressed with serious apprehension of the fatal consequences with which the regular clergy and established church of this kingdom are threatened , if the said Bill should pass into law , consequences which they have maturely weighed , and as it became their duty , have anticipated with unimpassioned and unbiassed deliberation , humbly lay the following considerations before the house : That they are penetrated with the deepest concern in contemplating the probable injuries which the character of the clergy of the church of England will sustain as a body , from the suspicions which this Bill is calculated to inspire , suspicions which they conceive are unmerited , tending to lower them in the estimation of the people , and to alienate , if not to destroy , that sentiment of respect and attachment which has been hitherto observed towards the clergy , as an integral and important
