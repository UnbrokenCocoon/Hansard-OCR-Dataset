in India may be best secured from injury thereby . '' The question upon the first Resolution being put from the Chair , rose and began by saying—In offering myself to your attention , Mr. Speaker , for the purpose of objecting to the Resolutions proposed , and taking a view of the event to which they relate , essentially differing from that stated by the hon . baronet who has just sat down , I may be permitted to express some degree of surprise , arising from the period at which this subject is now submitted to the consideration of the house . If the transaction in question be of the nature described in the speech we have just heard ; —if the epithets of foul and atrocious , which have been repeatedly applied to it , have been justly applied ; —if it does indeed , as vitally as it is said to do , involve the faith , the justice , and the character of the country ; —if it is not brought forward rather for the distinction of an individual , than as a necessary vindication of the national honour ; —it is surely a matter of just astonishment , that it should not be till after the sixth year from the time it was first brought under the notice of this house , —that it should not be till after every document elucidating it has been printed and reprinted for the consideration of three successive parliaments—that we are at length arrived at this long looked for discussion . I do not mean to accuse the hon . baronet : it is only for a comparatively short part of that period he has had a seat in this house , and I must do him the justice to say , that since he has undertaken the business , I am not aware of its having been delayed a single hour on the ground of his personal convenience ; —but if there are those who concur in his impressions , who are prepared to manifest that concurrence by their votes this night , and who have enjoyed opportunities which he has not possessed , of appealing to the judgment of parliament , —it will become them , nay , sir , they owe it to themselves , to this house , and to their country , to repel , if they can , the charge of such a dereliction of their public duty , as irresistibly results from their having endured , for so long a period , a stain so foul to disgrace the British name—from having left the national faith and justice , six long years , wounded , impeached , dishonoured , and , as far as de- 325 pended on their efforts , wholly unredressed.—Late as it is , it must still be a matter of satisfaction , as well to the noble lord against whom the resolutions are principally directed , as to all who either from personal or public motives feel an interest in the subject of them , that the accusation is finally before the house ; and I trust that the decision of this night ( not such as anticipated by the lion , baronet , but one more consistent with substantial justice ) will set this question at rest for ever ; that it will not be suffered to continue suspended over our heads , or furnish , any longer , against the noble lord and our counsels in India , a vehicle for every species of libel and calumny , that ingenuity , disappointment , and revenge can devise or propagate.—That a measure of the description of this now under our consideration should not excite clamour and hostility in some quarters , would have been contrary to every rational probability and expectation . No man who knows what has been passing in that part of India for the last thirty or forty years—the corruptions , the abuses , the iniquities , that have prevailed there , but must have foreseen that a measure calculated to eradicate those corruptions , to frustrate the hopes of avarice , to
