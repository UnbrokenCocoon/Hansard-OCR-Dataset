irruption of the king of Prussia into Saxony , in the year 1756 , in the midst of apparently profound peace , is a fact with which every one must be acquainted . What was his defence ? he had reason to believe that Saxony participated with other powers in a confederacy for his destruction , and that this gave him the right of immediate war . On this right he acted , and though there were circumstances in the manner in which he conducted his measures that excited clamour against him at the time , there is no man at this day , I believe , who does not admit , that the act of carrying war into Saxony was fully justified . Such then is the right towards a power wholly independent . What is the difference in respect to a dependent and protected one ? it is this ; that in the case of an independent power , our eights can only be realised through the medium of successful war ; in that of a protected one we are already in the situation in which successful war would place us ; but it will not be , therefore , contended that our rights are less ; it will not be contended that what , consistently with every law , may be justly pursued through all the hazards and calamities of war , we are forbid to attempt when those calamities are dissociated from the acquisition of it—that , the measures which it is our unquestionable right to take against a foreign foe , we may not , legitimately , resort to , against a traitor in our very bosom : the rights are the same , though the means of them are widely different.—If these principles are just , let them be applied to the case before us ; and if gentlemen agree with me , in the conviction that the documents adduced , combined with subsequent circumstances , clearly prove a connection to have been established , on the part of the nabobs , with Tippoo Sultaun , at the very time he was meditating hostilities against us , and that in prosecution of the purposes of this connection , he was not only furnished with intelligence and advice , but during the contest , is which our very existence was involved , Omdut ul Omrah adhered to his cause , and aided him to the extent of his power , by treacherously obstructing our supplies , and embarrassing the progress of our arms . They must feel also with me , that every engagement between us and our ally was abrogated ; and so abrogated as , at the same time , to constitute that case of injury , from which , according to the usages of nations , the rights of war legitimately 355 result.—Had the detection of this correspondence occurred previous to the fall of Seringapatam ; had we , during the actual existence of hostilities , discovered the course of infidelity by which the nabob was betraying our cause , and counteracting our measures ; had we at once , in the moment of indignation , repaid his ingratitude and perfidy , by driving him from the throne , and assuming his country , where is the man that could have hesitated upon the justice of the act ? But , sir , neither did the discovery take place under these circumstances , nor when it did take place , did the governor-general so act upon it ; on the contrary , a period of time was suffered to elapse before he availed himself of any of the rights with which the disaffection of the nabobs had invested him . And this is supposed to create a new and different case . What real difference can be found in it is beyond my comprehension ; but so it is contended ; and being contended , I can not , pass it by without notice . The right of war is one thing , and the exercise of that right is another ; the principle of the first is justice , of the
