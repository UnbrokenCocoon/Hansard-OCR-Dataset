of Ireland , and to the world , this country as a people devoted to civil commotion , as a nation of fanatics , incompetent to any other purpose but fanaticism , and incapable of acting with energy against the enemy of the British empire . The counter Petitions which were presented upon a former occasion , were the sentiments of well meaning men , who , when they fled from the shadow of the Pope , were precipitated into that gulph into which so many nations had fallen and continue to fall . It gives me great pleasure to see that the sense of public danger has recalled men 's minds from those narrow principles which a ridiculous fear of Popery hail so long encouraged . Those fears are now removed , and therefore it is that you do not find upon the table of this house any one Petition against the Roman Catholics ( save one presented this day ) . Such symptoms augur well for the security of the empire , and I congratulate the public upon it . It is an example of liberality well worth the wisdom of a great nation , of that wisdom which prompted you to form an alliance with Austria—You restored the Pope—you took Catholics into your pay—you afforded protection to the family of Portugal , you lent aid and assistance to transplant that family to South America—you planted Popery there , in so doing you acted wisely . You have shewn the innocence of the Catholic religion—that there , is nothing in it dangerous to the state , and you have thereby falsified all those idle notions of the vices which some persons attributed to that mode of faith . What then do I ask of you this night on behalf of your fellow subjects , why this : that in the same spirit of wisdom and of liberality you would extend to one-fifth of your fellow subjects those beficial principles which I say you so wisely 552 and liberally extended to your foreign connections professing the Roman Catholic faith . It therefore now remains for you to exert that wisdom on behalf of your fellow subjects—to shew them that you are not less anxious for them than you were for your foreign allies—to convince them that an alliance , a natural one I with them , is not only your anxious wish , but that it is also your indispensible interest . It is on these grounds that I shall move for the house to go into a Committee on the Petition . The Petition prays relief for certain disabilities and restrictions which the act of the 33rd of the king did not remove ; that act allowed them a certain portion of political power—it gave them elective franchises , and made them a part of the constituent power , subject , however , to certain exemptions ; but it did not allow them to fill all offices in the state , nor did it admit them to eligibility for seats in parliament . It admitted them to all offices civil and military , with the exception of about forty in number , it is against these exceptions they now petition , and apply to be admitted to fill all offices.—Before I proceed to offer some arguments in support of the Petitioners ' case , it will be necessary for me to notice the arguments of those who oppose this admission ; and first then against the exceptions . It has been objected against the Catholics , that they freely acknowledge the power of a foreign potentate , and that they are not bound by the obligation of any oath which they make with persons of a different religion ; that is to say , that a portion of your subjects , composing one-fifth of the population of the whole empire , a very considerable part of your constituency , hold principles which militate against the preservation of the social compact—are destitute of all those moral principles which regulate the social system—that they are execrable and are rendered thus execrable by their religion , and consequently unworthy of participating
