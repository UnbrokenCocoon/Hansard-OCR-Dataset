circumstances , but would very shortly be before the house ; this would enable them to decide upon the necessity of the measure . He should , therefore , move 'That the committal of the bill be deferred until this day se'nnight . ' of Scotland saw no reason for the delay proposed , and was surprised to find the hon . member had any serious objection to the bill , which was only intended to set the superannuated Judges of Scotland on the same liberal footing as those of England . It was an improper mode of providing for the superannuated Judges from the revenue of the king ; first , because these pensions could be withdrawn at pleasure ; and secondly , because they would expire with the life of the king . He considered the delay proposed as dangerous to the Bill , and , therefore , should oppose it . wished the bill should not be committed until the report of the Finance Committee should be before the house ; the delay was inconsiderable , and might be attended with advantage to the country.â€”After a few words from Mr. Rose , the gallery was cleared for a division . On the division there appeared for going into the Committee , Ayes 63 ; Noes 32 . Majority 31 . The house then went into a committee .
