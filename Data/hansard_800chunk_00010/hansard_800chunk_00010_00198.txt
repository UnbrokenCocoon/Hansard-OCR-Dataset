the circar , delivered over , without remorse , an unprotected and unresisting people . For the first I beg leave to refer to the sicken- 360 ing detail given by lord Hobart , in one of the papers on your table ( it is too long to read , and it is scarcely possible to make selections ) in which , after describing the progress of these transactions , through all their circumstances , and tracing a truly afflicting picture of the iniquity and barbarity that accompanied them , he concludes a part of his statement by observing : After this exposition , no comment can be required to shew that this species of government , if it deserves the name of government , contains the most grievous oppression of the people , the certain impoverishment of the country ; and consequently the inevitable decay of the revenue . In another passage , speaking of the effect of the system pursued , upon the resources as connected with the state of the country , he says , whatever diminution ( and it is considerable ) in value , the security is gradually though rapidly sustaining , carries along with it the desfraction of the human race , and the desolation of the country.—With respect to the latter , I shall only beg leave to read the account of the collector of Trichinopoly : alluding to the management previous to the transfer of the administration , he writes ; The late management , whether considered in a speculative or practical point of view , presents , generally speaking , as its distinguishing features , a total want of system , where system would have been beneficial , a most baneful spirit of extortion and oppression , and an indifference to the happiness and welfare of the people , as senseless as inhuman . The people never knew when the demands on them were to cease , nor do the managers seem to have known when their extortions were to stop . The assessments called fixed , seem only to have been calculated to point out where extortion might be levied and increased , and to induce the inhabitants to cultivate , in the vain hope that no more than the fixed assessment , whether in grain or money , would be taken from them ; a hope which returned with every season , but which returned only to blast the prospects of those who too credulously indulged it . I will venture to assert , that if the revenues were in any one year collected according to the established rates of assessment , it was only to in duce the inhabitants , by this apparent moderation , to increase the cultivation of the succeeding year , and thus afford the managers or renters an opportunity 361 of doubling their plunder.—The conviction of the house must anticipate any observations of mine on the effects of such a system , under which no country , however otherwise blessed by the bounty of Providence , could flourish ; rapid decay must have reduced , and speedy extinction impended over the resources on which our dependence rested , —To arrest the progress of this evil would have been in itself a sufficient motive , were we even incapable of feeling the more noble one of rescuing a suffering people from such calamity . That the transfer of the administration , and that alone , could accomplish these objects , I will not endeavour to make out in argument . By relying for the proof of its necessity on the highest authorities to which , on Indian subjects , we are accustomed to refer , I am sure I shall serve my cause more effectually , more completely , and satisfy the minds of all who hear me . Is or does it rest alone on the authority of every governor who has presided there , but of every individual whose judgment has been of real value , who felt or understood either the British interests , or the interests of the country itself ; and who has been free from the participation and taint
