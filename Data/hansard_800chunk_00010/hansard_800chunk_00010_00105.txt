'question ! question ! ' He said , from the turn the debate had taken on the other side of the house he should wish for some little information . He was anxious to know how far they meant to carry their intolerance ? Hitherto they had been debating how far the disabilities of the Catholics were to be taken off . The house was now discussing how far a learned gentleman , who had expressed an ardent opinion in favour of the Protestant religion , was unfit for a situation of trust and honour . Instead of removing the Catholic disabilities , the gentlemen opposite called upon the house to degrade a man for using strong language in favour of his religion If this was their religious toleration , he was afraid it might degenerate into religious apathy and indifference . said , that he was aware that a member who brought forward a specific motion , was , by the rules of the house , entitled to reply , but as nothing in the shape of argument had been urged on the other side , he had his doubts whether he should avail himself of the courtesy granted upon such occasions .
