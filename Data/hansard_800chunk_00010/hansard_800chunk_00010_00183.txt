into the correspondence , it is not surely presuming much to suppose that they would have introduced one that might have borne strongly upon the point it was their natural object to establish , and from which powerful inferences might be deduced . But from this it would require more than human ingenuity to extract any thing of real importance . And if it be a fabrication , it is not only improbable in respect to the character , and unworthy of the ability of those to whom it must be attributed , but certainly the most gratuitous and unprofitable one that ever was committed.—The harmony and union being thus , sir , established , the letter we now are to consider begins to display the fruits of it ; to this I shall join No . 12 , because the observations , applicable to that immediately before me , are , in a great degree , applicable to both . They alike convey intelligence of considerable moment to the 338 sultaun 's interests , and advice for the regulation of his conduct as arising out of it . They alike expressly refer to the good understanding recently established , and may be not unfairly admitted as a proof of the nature of those services which the sultaun appears to have expected from the nabob , as tending to the support of the Mahommedan faith.—Before I proceed to the contents of these two letters , I beg to be allowed to put it to every man who hears me , with what impressions he would learn , that a person who had received the most substantial benefits from this country , who , maintained by its bounty , and existing but by its protection , after soliciting and establishing a secret intercourse with a foreign power , had been detected in conveying to it intelligence , and suggesting counsels for the government of its measures , at a period too , when , though nominally at peace , it was known not only to entertain the most inveterate enmity toward us , but was suspected of actually preparing to give effect to that enmity ? Suppose , for instance , that one under these circumstances had been detected at any time , in writing to the French , or any foreign government actuated by feelings similar to those of France , in terms of this kind : `` The conduct you are pursuing excites suspicion—be more cautious—this is not the moment to commence hostilities with any prospect of advantage . There is now a minister who enjoys the confidence of the—country who is capable of calling out all its resources , and directing them against you with energy and success—wait a little—symptoms of a change in our counsels manifest themselves , and there appears the chance of a successor the very reverse of the minister I have described : when this change takes place , you may prosecute your hostile purposes without apprehension.—Or , imagine , sir , the design of the hostile power to be the invasion of this kingdom , and the person I am supposing had written Do not attempt to invade great Britain . Here every man is devoted to the government of his country , and every arm will be raised to drive you from its shores—Here your attempt can only expose you to inevitable destruction : but , there are other parts of the British empire more vulnerable , where you may possibly find less of union , or less preparation to resist your attacks ; there direct your efforts ; but as you tender your hopes of success , or 339 your escape from destruction , avoid an invasion of England . If , sir , such counsels were detected , accompanied with every expression of attachment and devotion to that power and to its cause , I ask , What would be the impression on every unprejudiced mind ? would it be , that this was done in the spirit of loyalty , and zeal for the service of this country ? —that in one instance it was to obviate the calamities
