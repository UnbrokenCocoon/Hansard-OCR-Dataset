strongest evidence that the point of law never was argued before this house , and that my lord Thurlow , if he is supposed to decide the point of law , must have done what nobody will accuse him of doing ; i. e. he must have rashly decided a point of law not before him , and noways argued or discussed by the counsel.—It is further to be observed , that lord Thurlow , by reversing the interlocutors complained of , gave efficacy to the interlocutor of the 3d of March , which declared that the stipend modified 1716 , was within the minimum , so that in truth the judgment simply reversing the interlocutor complained of , was a judgment of this house , proceeding on the specialties of the case.—The other case , in which the court of session in their interlocutor have found that your ldps decided the general question of law , is the case of Tingwall , which was first brought into court in the year 1785 , when the heritors appear to have pleaded in bar a previous augmentation granted in the year 1722 . But before I 467 call your attention to the decision in this case , I must make an observation on the nature of the proceedings 'which took place , as they prove beyond a possibility of a doubt what at that time was the general opinion of the judgment given by the house of lords in the case of Kirkden.—If.this house , by reversing the interlocutor of the court of session in the case of Kirkden , had been understood to declare the law , as is argued by the respondent , and to have decided the competency of that court , acting under the act 1707 , to re-augment stipends as long as the tithe of the parish remained unexhausted , could there have been an argument in the court of session on the subject , far less an unanimous decision on the incompetency of the court , when they must have all known the recent judgment moved by lord Thurlow in this house ? On the other hand , if they were in the knowledge that the decision of this house was granted on that noble lord 's having arraigned as inept any resolution of their court , which barred a due consideration of what was the law of the land on the point—was it not natural to expect , that , driven from the ground behind which they had for years entrenched themselves , they would be forced to discuss the law , which , relying on the rule , had not of late been the subject of their consideration , accordingly as might be expected ? Those of your ldps who have attended to the proceedings in this case , must recollect that after a hearing in presence , and memorials being given in , there took place a very learned discussion on the abstract question of law , which ended in an unanimous judgment of the court , against the power that was contended for.—The notes of the judges speeches are printed in the memorial for the appellant ; and though lord Thurlow had , on the authority of the lord advocate , now lord president , stated that the court was in daily practice of referring to the rule which was urged as a bar in the Kirkden case , not one syllable is said on that subject throughout the speeches then made ; clearly proving that the decision in the Kirkden case must have shut their mouths on a subject to which on similar occasions there is evidence they had daily habits of resorting.—In this case of Tingwall there were special circumstances in favour of the clergyman , on which it is at present needless to dwell . Your ldps have in the notes of the judges speeches on this cause , evidence , that When it came into the court 468 below , the parties agreed that the general point of law should be there argued , and that no specialties should be founded upon ; so says lord Robertson
