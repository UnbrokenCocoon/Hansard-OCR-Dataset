, incompatible with their duties , either as men , or as subjects , or in any way hurtful to the government under which they live . In vain they publish declaration upon declaration , in all of which they most unequivocally disavow those highly exceptionable tenets which are imputed to them : and not only do they disavow , but they express their abhorrence of them . In vain they confirm these declarations by an oath—an oath , my lords , framed by ourselves , drawn up with all possible care , and caution , and couched in terms as strong as language affords . In addition to these ample securities , for the principles and practice of this numerous and loyal class of our fellow subjects and fellow christians , a great statesman , now unhappily no more , caused to be transmitted a string of very important queries , to the principal Catholic Universities abroad ; for the purpose of ascertaining , with precision , the sentiments of the Catholic Clergy , respecting the real nature and extent of the papal power , and some other weighty points . The answers returned to these queries , by those learned bodies , appeared to me at the time , as they do now , perfectly satisfactory , and in the same light they were considered by most dispassionate men . Notwithstanding all this , a concealed jealousy of Catholics still lurks about , by far , too many of us ; a jealousy , in my opinion , as unworthy of a frank and enlightened people , as it is injurious and cruel towards those who are the objects of it : for surely , my lords , if there be one position more incontrovertibly true than another , it is this : if an in 677 dividual , or a body of men , will give to the government under which they live such a security upon oath , as that government itself prescribes ; —if , moreover , they maintain no opinions destructive of moral obligation , or subversive of civil society ; their speculative opinions of a religious nature , can never , with justice or with reason , be urged as excluding them from civil and military situations . The Catholics , my lords , give this security ; and having given it , the legislature itself has declared , that they ought to be considered ' as good and loyal subjects ; ' as such , therefore , in my view of the subject , they are unquestionably entitled to the privileges which they claim . When I speak of merely speculative opinions of religion , I wish to be understood as meaning such opinions as begin in the understanding , and rest there , and have no practical influence whatsoever upon our conduct in life . With this limitation , I am not sensible that there is any fallacy in the argument which I have made use of ; if there be any , I shall be happy to have it pointed out ; as I can not possibly have any motive in view but what from my heart , I believe to be the truth.—Should an unfortunate and deep rooted prejudice prevail so far , as to make us say , decidedly and openly , that we will not believe a Catholic even upon his oath , there is an end , my lords , of the discussion at once ; but the argument , if argument it can be called , proves a great deal too much ; and for this plain reason : no obligation more binding than that of an appeal to the Supreme Being by an oath , has hitherto been devised in civil society : —he , therefore , who can justly be supposed capable of setting at nought such an obligation , upon any pretence whatsoever , is not only unworthy of the privileges here contended for , but he is unfit for all social intercourse of every kind—Vetabo sub iisdem sit trabibus.—Harsh , and horrid , as the expression must sound in your lordships
