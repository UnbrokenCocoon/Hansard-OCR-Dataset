called Wallah Jah , nabob of the Carnatic , was an ally of the East India Company , and under a vicissitude of fortunes , attendant on the introduction of the British power in India , adhered to the British cause , when it was endangered by the contending interests and arms of France ; that under a just sense of the services so rendered by Mahommed Ally , and with the especial view to prevent all future controversy respecting the succession to that kingdom , an acknowledgment of the right in the person of the nabob Mahommed Ally , and in his heirs and successors for ever , was procured in the treaty concluded at Paris in the year 1763 , and formally recognised therein by the powers of England and France.—That at various times since , the East India Company have entered into divers agreements and treaties , through their governments in India , with Mahommed Ally , under the character and title of nabob of Arcot , or of the Carnatic , for the express purpose , and with the avowed intent , of defending , jointly with their own , the title and rights of the said nabob ; and especially in two treaties concluded in the years 1787 , and 1792 , the latter of which purports to be a treaty executed on behalf of the East India Company , their heirs and successors , and to be mutually binding as well on them as on his highness the nabob Mahommed Ally , and his successor , his eldest son Omdut ul Omrah , and his heirs and successors ; that such treaty of 1792 remained in force , and as such , obligatory on the contracting parties , at the death of the said Mahommed Ally , which happened in the year 1796 , who at his death was succeeded by his said son Omdut ul Omrah—That the said Omdut ul Omrah died in the month of July , 1801 , without any alteration or modification of the said treaty having been made in his life , time—2 .

That it appears to this house , that the government of Madras , acting under the authority of instructions from the marquis Wellesley , the governor general of India , refused to admit the said prince Ally Hussein , to succeed to the musnud of the Carnatic , in virtue of the will of his father the late nabob , and of the said treaty of 1792 , unless he would previously consent to an ignominious and disgraceful surrender of ail his rights in the territorial possessions of the Carnatic , and accept in lieu thereof an indefinite sum as a bounty or gratuity from the Company ; and on the steady and dignified refusal of the said prince to accede to this unworthy and humiliating proposition , his , succession was set aside , and another and more distant branch of the family of Mahommed Ally , namely , Azeem ul Dowlah , was
