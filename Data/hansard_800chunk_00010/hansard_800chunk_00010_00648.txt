. Where there is one court , there is no effort arising from a desire to excel , as there is when there are several courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction , taking cognizance of the same causes ; —and we can not disguise , that it is in justice , as in every thing else , that competition begets exertion , and that with exertion duty is more perfectly discharged . In this country ( England ) , the suitor having three courts open in all matters of law and equity , the King 's Bench , the Common Pleas , and Law side of the Exchequer , for actions at law , —the Court of Chancery , the Rolls , and the Equity side 1065 of the Exchequer , for suits in equity , there is an ample choice of tribunals , awl a perfect inducement to excel by competition ; and suitors , if they have any objection to the modes and habits of one court , may go to another.—i have no doubt , that it would have been much better , if the court of session was likewise to have been divided into three courts.—First , Because there is a certainty , by that division , of settling the law more satisfactorily , the opinion of two bodies , on a doubtful question , leaving the mind less satisfied than that of three ; and , because where there is a difference of opinion , on similar questions of law , the third tribunal casts the balance , and fixes the point.—Secondly , Because , by making more divisions , each of the courts would be reduced to a smaller number , which certainly renders the tribunal more perfect.—It . may be observed here , that a court consisting of four is the best number ; because , when there is a difference of opinion , and the court is equally divided , the matter may go to the higher tribunal ; if it is not equally divided , there must be a majority of three to one , the greatest majority that any number affords , and which is , of course , calculated to give more satisfaction to the suitors , and the public , than any other number that can be pitched upon.—On these topics , however , I do not now mean to enlarge . I only throw them out , not as opposing the present bill , but as suggestions for future improvement . It ought , however , in fairness , to be observed , that the courts or chambers will not be so numerous as they appear.—There will be one or two lords from each court employed in discharging the duty of lords ordinary , during the sitting of the chamber to which they belong , so that the president 's court will usually be six—never more than seven ; and the justice-clerk 's court will be usually five— never more than six ; —so that we have every reason to hope , that , by this regulation of the bill , the tribunal for the discussion of civil rights in Scotland , thus reduced and constituted , will lose the character which is alledged now to belong to it , of being too numerous , and as having more resemblance to a popular assembly , than is fitting for a court of justice.—Sir , the bill now under consideration , does not , ill its preamble , assign the sound principles of judicial jurisprudence , to which I have just referred , as the reason for its enactments ; but alleges only the great increase of business . It runs thus : 'Where- 1066 'as , the great extension of agriculture , 'commerce , manufactures , and population , 'and the consequent multiplication of 'transactions in Scotland , have greatly increased the number of law-suits brought 'into the court of session , whereby it has 'become expedient to make some new 'arrangements in that court , to facilitate 'the dispatch of business . `` —Now , Sir , it is somewhat singular , that the increase of law-suits ,
