Omrah , and the manner in which , when the occasion was presented by the exigencies of a war in which we were called on to defend the existence of our empire in India , that pledge was afterwards redeemed . Let any man , I say , consider these things , and pronounce , if he can , in the face of God and his country , a conscientious belief , that the nabobs of the Carnatic were faithful to our cause , the duties of alliance , and their own engagements ; that the charge against them is without foundation ; that the treaties by which they were bound were not violated ; that a correspondence of a political nature was not carried on ; and a conduct resulting from it pursued , hostile to the just rights , and affecting the security of the British empire in India.—If , sir , the conclusion I feel it my duty to draw , and as it appears to my apprehension the only just one that can be drawn from all that has been stated , is the direct reverse of this . The rights accruing from it to the British government , become the next subject of inquiry and consideration.—The situation of the nabob may be considered in two points of view ; one with reference to the original dependancy of his station , under the mogul constitution , and the opinion that , in releasing him from his allegiance to his natural superior , we only transferred that allegiance to ourselves , as well as with reference to the revertible condition on which he received the Dewannee , and the state of practical subjection in which he stood controlled in his foreign relations , and indebted to us , both for the external defence , and internal security , of all he enjoyed , regarding him , in a word , as a mere feudatory of the British power.—In the other point of view , he may be considered as relying , indeed , upon us for his safety and protection , but possessing , nevertheless , the rights of an independent prince ; rights deduced from the circumstance of the condition of his engagements which have been alluded to , having been , on his part , repeatedly infringed , and that infringement never having on ours been made a pretence for resuming what our friendship had conferred on him , from repeated treaties having been concluded with him , both sub equent to , and in contemplation of these very breaches 352 of engagement , and his having on these occasions , both treated and been treated with , in the character of an independent prince . Thus it may be said , as far as related to us , though maintained by the power and protection of our government , he was invested with all the political and personal rights incident to real sovereignty and independence.—To this latter opinion I own myself inclined to accede , but I can not admit that the treaty of 1763 , alluded to in the resolutions , has any bearing or effect on this question . The article in that treaty which alone mentions the nabob , was introduced for the sole purpose of terminating the disputed claims of Salabat Jing , and Mahomet Ally , in support of which respectively , France and England had carried on the war in the peninsula of India . They therefore joined in recognizing , as far as they were concerned , the former as subah of the Deccan , the latter as nabob of Arcot . What the powers and privileges of each were in their several situations , was a point left wholly untouched , and to be determined by the laws and usages of the Mogul empire.—The character then in which I am willing to consider the nabob , is that of an independent prince under the protection of the British power , nor have I a wish to insist on any right , or to appeal to any law in favour of what has been done by our
