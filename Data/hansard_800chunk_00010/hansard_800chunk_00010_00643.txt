; but the balance due to them from government turning out to be larger than was imagined , and the company 's affairs assuming a more favourable aspect , as far as related to their sales at home , he 1056 had now no hesitation in declaring , that his decided opinion was that the company could go on very well without further assistance until the reassembling of parliament . He had therefore not felt authorised to come to parliament for any further aid during the present session . Whether parliament would be called upon in the next session for further aid he knew not , but if they were , he thought they would do well , not merely to consider the pecuniary circumstances of the company , at the time when such aid might be required , but to look into all the bearings of their affairs , and to consider how far such aid might be accompanied by regulations , which would place the company in a better situation than that in which they were now placed.â€”The amendments were then agreed to , and the bill was ordered to be read a third time to-morrow . after enumerating the various measures that had been adopted and recommended for the relief of the West India interest , and commenting upon their value and efficacy , moved , pursuant to his notice , `` That the house do resolve itself into a committee of the whole house , to take into consideration the second and third Reports of the West India committee .
