said , that many of them not having got the statutable allowance , and others , though their stipends were modified , not having obtained decrees of locality , it is judged most necessary , that the commission should `` be kept up till the work was ended ; '' clearly implying , that the clergy and nobility , in making this report in the year 1637 , still conceived that the object was the same as recited in the preamble of the act 1633.—Stron '' ; evidence of this being the sound construction of the act 1633 , is also to be found in the act of parliament which passed Nov. 15 , 1641 : this act , though not referred to by the act , 1707 , and in truth not in existence , being rescinded after the restoration , may be referred to as explaining the sense parliament entertained at the time of the act 1633 : and any illustration derived from it is the more forcible , because the power the presbyterian clergy then possessed , ensured that the interpretation the most conformable to their interests of which it was susceptible would be imposed upon it.—Yet this act does not empower the commission it appoints , to take into consideration , generally , what sum it was fit to grant to the clergyman out of the tithes which had been sold . Indeed it specially bars the possibility of augmentations being granted on this principle , because it confines the attention of the commissioners to those cases , 'who got not the benefit of 'the former commission , and have not the full quantity of eight chalders of victual , or 800 merks , according to the tenour of the Acts of Parliament made in anno 1633 . '—The only other cases submitted to the cognizance of this commission , where previous augmentations had taken place , were those where there existed proofs of agreement betwixt the minister and his heritors , or where the parish mi- 457 nister had been defrauded by the interference of the prelates.—The act 1641 further shews , that the landholder was deemed to have acquired a real right to that which he had purchased , by cautiously avoiding , under any circumstances , subjecting his property to further demands.—But it is not the phraseology of the act 1633 ; it is not the full knowledge of the king 's intention and of the tenour of his decreets arbitral ; it is not his majesty 's declaration of his sense of what had been done ; it is not the clear coincidence in opinion of the clergy themselves in their report in the year 1636 ; nor even the commentary afforded by the rescinded act 1041 , upon which I rely in giving a decided opinion on the meaning of the act 1033 . The reports of the decisions of the commission appointed under this rescinded act , support this interpretation of the act of parliament in the strongest manner . In the acts and practicks of the commission 1042 , there are three decisions reported upon very different points , but none of which can in common sense , be reconciled to any other view of the law , than that which I have given to your ldps.—The acts 1633 and 1041 , it will be recollected , ordered the commissioners to set aside , after the valuation of the tithe , a constant local stipend for the clergyman , and then gave to the landholder the right of purchasing the remainder at nine years purchase . It appears that there came before the commission a case , wherein it was disputed , whether the landholder could purchase his tithe before the minister got a stipend ; and it was decided , ( earl of Haddington against Bearford ) that the heritor may buy Ins teinds , although the kirk be not provided , if he be content to undergo the proportionable part of the augmentation , when it shall be granted , notwithstanding the right he had acquired by purchase , clearly shewing , that in this case the
