from commerce , population , and agriculture , should be assigned as the reason for this measure , and that the language of the bill , respecting the introduction of trial by jury , should be so tame and discouraging ; for it is manifest , to every person accustomed to that in comparable system of judicature ( trial by jury ) that if the increase of judicial business has arisen from the causes assigned in this preamble , there ought to have been an immediate introduction of trial by jury in those cases , as being peculiarly suited for that tribunal.—Questions on policies of insurance , on bills of exchange , on mercantile contracts of every description , all those personal actions which are the result of increased population , and increased dealings between man and man , in agriculture , manufactures , and commerce , are peculiarly suited to trial by jury . The cases arising out of such transactions are , necessarily , mere matters of fact , in which the most simple and the shortest forms of pleading only can be necessary to be put on the record . As nothing is required , almost in any of those cases , but the simple allegation of the plaintiff or pursuer , stating the injury of which he complains , and the equally simple denial of the defendant . What in England constitutes and is called the declaration , and a plea of the general issue , and what in Scotland constitutes and is termed the summons and the defences.—It is material to observe , likewise , that the introduction of the trial by jury , in those cases in which it is practicable , would give the greatest possible relief to the appellate jurisdiction of the house of lords . A jury takes to itself , exclusively , all matter of fact , whereas , at present , the facts , in , every case that is appealed , must go to the house of lords , forcing that tribunal to examine into the fact , as well as to decide upon the law , and go through most voluminous and ill-ascertained proofs , liable to much uncertainty , extremely , inaccurate and confused ; whereas nothing should be carried to an appellate judicature but mere matter of law.—I own that I feel 1067 most earnest and anxious to take this public opportunity of impressing the importance of introducing trial by jury ; and I am the more anxious to do so , because , when I consider the manner in which the commissioners , created by this act for inquiring and reporting on this subject , are to be appointed , when I perceive that that appointment rests with the ministers of the crown , or rather , with those who are the authors of this bill , I am very apprehensive that there is still less chance of the trial by jury being introduced at all into the civil judicature of Scotland.—I know that it is the opinion of a person of great , influence , one who will be much listened to on this subject—it is the opinion of a judge who has a most profound knowledge of the law of Scotland , I mean the president of the court of session , that questions of the sort to which I have referred , namely , questions on bills of exchange and policies of insurance , are not lit to be tried by jury.—When the resolutions of the house of lords , preparatory to another bill , afterwards brought forward by lord Grenville , ( the measure-which first introduced the amelioration of the Scots judicial system in civil causes to the notice of parliament , ) were in circulation , I considered it to be my duty , on this important public subject , to have a conference with that learned judge , and at his desire I waited upon him for that purpose . The object of us both was purely public . I listened with great attention to opinions and views , coming from a person of the highest respectability for
