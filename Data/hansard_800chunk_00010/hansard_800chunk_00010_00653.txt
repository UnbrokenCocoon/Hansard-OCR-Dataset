questions of law , arising in a cause , are liable to be transferred from the tribunal which the party has chosen , to that which he has avoided , — not by any act of his own , but at the will of others , —by the independent act of the court in which he brought his action , who are placed beyond the influence of his argument , and whom he can not controul by any application , calculated to operate on their discretion , or stay their proceedings . This is not like the act of a losing party proceeding to another tribunal , by appeal , but an act of the court , to obtain a legal opinion , which , it is to be presumed , may decide the cause . But this is not all ; the division or chamber , which is to state the question of law in writing , for the opinion of the other division or chamber , are to be themselves the framers of that question . The party , whose rights is to be decided by it , are to have no share in framing it . It is not to be submitted to them , nor the terms of it settled in their presence . It is not to be settled by the interposition of their counsel , or by any public proceeding of the court ; but by the act of the judges of the division , in private , behind the back of the parties , and without any discussion , to set right any mistakes , in the view which may be adopted of the question.—Those who know any thing of the proceedings of courts of justice , are well aware , that the soundness of an answer to a question of law , depends upon the correctness of the statement of it ; that the most important rights may receive a perfectly different decision , by the manner m which the case is framed , or the question stated . What shall-we say then of an institution which enables the tribunal , before which a case is brought , to state the question of law- , not only without the mutual discussion of the advocates on both sides , but in their absence ; that the case so stated , shall decide the cause : a regulation , which shall enable the judges of one tribunal , privately , to draw up a question for the collective or individual opinion of the judges of the other tribunal : an institution , by which the judges who are to give their opinion on the question of law , are not only not bound to do it in public , but where it is clear that it is meant that they shall do it in private ; so that a case privately drawn up by one division , or tri- 1073 bunal , is to be privately pronounced upon by the judges of the other division , thus again violating the best and soundest rules of judicial jurisprudence—rules which the wisdom of the framers of the judicial system of this country ( England ) have thought so essential to the pure administration of justice . Namely * that judgments shall be pronounced in public , before a critical well-informed bar ; and in a court where all the world has a right to enter , to hear the opinion of the judges publicly delivered . Is it possible , that such a violation of all the best and wisest maxims for securing judicial purity , calculated equally to preserve individual righs , and to give satisfaction to the public mind , in matters of judgment , should be allowed to stand in your statute-book ! —But , sir , I have not even How stated all the mischief and anomaly of this regulation . I believe , there is no person who knows any thing of the administration of justice , who does not admit , that the judge or tribunal , that is to decide , receives the greatest benefit from having the case
