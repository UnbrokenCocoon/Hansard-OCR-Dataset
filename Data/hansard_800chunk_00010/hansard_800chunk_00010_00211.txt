informed by lord Buckinghamshire , that he considered the granting assignments on the mortgaged districts , a violation of the treaty . And the government at home , in July 1796 , warned the nabob of the consequences of such conduct ; but there is stronger evidence than this , of the nabob 's violation of the treaty , for the nabob himself , in a paper delivered to lord Wellesley , in May 1798 , says , Having complained that , under the present arrangement of my monthly kists , he was compelled , at a particular period of every year , to raise money for the payment of the Company 's military subsidy , which money was repaid from his countries in the following manner ; viz . supposing a kist of a lack of pagodas was to be paid , we received 60 thousand from the country , and borrowed the remaining 40 thousand from some person , and give him an order on that country for that amount , which he receives . It was well known that these assignments extended to the districts specified in the treaty , for it was recorded by lord Buckinghamshire , in a minute in council , that the southern districts of the nabob 's country , and Tinnivelly in particular , as being the most distant from the presidency , have been the theatre in which these scenes have been chiefly exhibited ; but it is notorious that similar practices have been introduced , and are now actually carried on in Nellore , Arcot , and Trichinopoly.—The house 380 would recollect , that every one of those districts was specified in the treaty.—But it had been attempted to be argued by the nabob , that his granting assignments on the mortgaged districts , was not a violation of treaty ; and that the only penalty for so doing , was in the event of those districts being assumed by the company , that the assignments should be of no value and of no effect . The 5th section of the 8tli article of the treaty of 1792 was as follows , and with the leave of the house , colonel Allan said , that he would read it . in consequence of the measure whereby the districts mentioned in the Schedule , No . 2. become responsible for any arrears that may accrue in the payment of the above stipulated kists , the said nabob agrees that he will not grant tunkaws or assignments on any account on the revenues thereof ; and if , contrary to this condition , any tunkaws or assignments should exist when the said districts , or any of them , shall be assumed by the said Company , such tunkaws or assignments shall be declared , by the said Company , and the said nabob , to be of no value , nor shall they remain in effect.—He would not , however , attempt to argue what should be the just construction of this clause , as he had no doubt , that , if it should be necessary , it would be ably and successfully argued by persons whose opinions would have more weight in the house than his could have ; but he must say , that he thought his noble friend , lord Buckinghamshire , had put that construction upon it , which was intended by lord Cornwallis , who framed the treaty , and that it was at the time of its conclusion so understood by the nabob.—That he might not misstate his noble friend , he should make use of his own words contained in a public letter to the Court of Directors . The 5th section of the 8th article of the treaty of 1792 , says lord Buckinghamshire , is made to affect two parties , the nabob , and the money lender ; if the former grants assignments on the mortgaged districts , he is liable to such penalties as generally attach upon a breach of engagement ; if the latter advances his money upon securities upon the districts in question , he hazards the
