, whether a civil or criminal process should be founded thereon . It appeared upon some of them that the inquiries were not sufficient ; upon others , on the contrary , it was considered that a legal demand existed on the part of the nation , to be recovered by civil process ; and in every such case , application had been made to 1098 the party , as was customary in all private transactions , for payment of the sum demanded before the commencement of a civil suit , with directions , in case of noncompliance with the application , to resort to legal process . As the inquiries were still in prosecution , the noble lord might , in the next session , if he desired information upon the subject , apply to the treasury , and he had no doubt the business would then be in such a state as to allow of the whole proceedings being laid before parliament . For the present , he was sure the noble lord would not expect him to explain further , but of this he could assure that noble lord , that the subject had never been lost sight of by his majesty 's ministers . presented from the bar the Third Report of the Committee of Finance . On the report having been read , the hon . gent . rose to move that it do lie on the table , but before he should make that proposition , he felt it necessary to address an observation or two to the house . He hoped that gentlemen would not be alarmed at the enormous mass of papers which he had brought up , because under the instructions which had been given to the committee , he had conceived it necessary to communicate all the returns upon which the Report of the committee was founded .

On presenting a Report , which had occupied so large a portion of the attention of the committee , he was afraid that the house might suppose that much time had been lost in preparing it . But he could say , as well for himself , as on the part of the other members of the committee , that they had not been wanting in their duty . The delay , and that of some months , in presenting the Report , had arisen from the contrariety of opinion which had taken place in the committee , owing perhaps to its being composed of too numerous an assemblage of members . If it should be the pleasure of the house , that the committee should be renewed in another session , it would be a question . 1099 founded upon the experience of the present session , whether it ought to be composed of so large a number . Though this was the only Report which the committee had presented in the present session , he-assured the house that they had attended to other subjects , upon which they had made some progress , though under the instruction given to them by the house , they had looked upon themselves as bound to suspend such inquiries in order to make up this Report . They had made progress in the business relating to the Pay office , and the War office accounts ; but as these subjects were also under the consideration of the commissioners , they deemed it expedient to wait the these commissioners should make a Report upon these heads , a report which had been presented only on Saturday last .
