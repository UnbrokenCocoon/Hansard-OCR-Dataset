house , it was impossible for the people to look up to its justice with the respect and reverence it had been accustomed to do . He thought nothing but the most cogent and satisfactory reasons could justify the proceedings towards the nabob ; and that , as yet , nothing but reasons the most frivolous and inconclusive had been produced . He should certainly support the Resolutions . felt that , having on a former night ventured to state his opinion upon a question of a nature similar to that which was now brought before , the house , ( the Oude Charge , ) he should not discharge his duty with satisfaction to his own mind , were he to be silent upon a motion that related to transactions , which took place in the Carnatic , where he resided for an uninterrupted period of 20 years ; having , in the course of that time , also , held a confidential situation under his noble friend lord Buckinghamshire , during the whole of his administration in India , he had opportunities of knowing many of the facts , which were stated in the papers before the house . As the nabob of Arcot had never wanted advocates ( as they had witnessed even that night , ) to assert that he was an independent sovereign , and as many hon . members might not have had leisure or inclination to peruse the papers laid before parliament upon this subject , he wished shortly to draw the attention of the house to the origin of our connection with Mahomed Ally , and to the founda- 374 tion of his pretensions as nabob of Arcot , in order that a correct idea might be formed of the title and privileges which he actually possessed.—He thought he could shew , that it was during the contest between the English and the French , who had gained great influence in the Decan , and aimed at the exclusive possession of the Carnatic , that Mahomed Ally first introduced himself to our notice , not as the acknowledged nabob of Arcot , but as the competitor of Chunda Saib , whose pretensions were supported by the French.—He thought he could shew , that in that war , which terminated in leaving the English masters of the Carnatic , so little did Mahomed Ally or we think of conquering merely for him , that the British colours were regularly hoisted on the forts which surrendered to our arms : that we obtained from the mogul the sanction of his authority , under a commission to Mahomed Ally , as nabob of Arcot : that that office was one of deputation and dependence of a military nature , and quite distinct from the administration of the revenues , which belonged to the office of Dewan ; and that , through British influence , those two offices were united in his person , under the express condition , that the management of the revenues should revert to the Company , in the event of his being guilty of any secret practices , or of any failure in his pecuniary engagements.—But he thought he should best consult the wishes of the house , and certainly his own inclinations , by abstaining from these details ; he should therefore content himself by observing , that the nature of our connection with the nabob of Arcot would be found accurately described by lord Macartney , in a letter from the government of Madras to that of Bengal ; in which letter , speaking of this independent sovereign , his lordship observed , that he was no more reckoned than the nabob of Oude , among the native powers of Hindostan ; that they were both Europeans , in connection and dependence '' —He was aware that it was irregular to repeat the words made use of by any hon . member in a former debate , but he hoped he should not be considered out of order by slightly alluding to them .
