, who was ' counsel for the clergyman , and lord Newton who acted as counsel for the heritors ; and this is confirmed by lord Armadale , in the very able speech he delivered on that occasion.—The interlocutor of the court was given in the most general terms ' dismissing the process ; and upon advising on a reclaiming petition from the minister , the court adhered : —against this interlocutor , an appeal was presented to this house : the printed cases on this occasion shew that the parties , as in the court below , confined their argument to the general question of law ; but the specialties of the case appeared on the record , and the judgment proposed by lord Thurlow , and adopted by the house , is conclusive evidence that this house came to no judgment on the general point of law ; it is clear that the noble lord , in the interlocutor he proposed in the Kirkden case , told the court of session , they should decide not upon their own rules , but upon the law of the land ; and it is equally clear that he meant to inform them by this interlocutor , that justice required they should hi the decision of every case , take the actual circumstances into their consideration . The judgment is in the following terms : —'Having considered the terms of the decree of modification and augmentation , which , as the libel alleges , was obtained by the minister of the said united parishes in 1722 , and that the minister was , in consequence thereof , allowed to possess the ipsa corpora of the teind till lately , when the heritors proceeded to obtain a decree of locality : it is ordered and adjudged , that the several interlocutors complained of be reversed , and that the cause be remitted back to the court of session in Scotland , as commissioners for the plantation of kirks and valuation of teind , in order that parties may be further heard upon the effect of the above circumstances , and upon the state of those teinds in these united parishes , without , prejudice to any plea or argument which either of them may adduce ; and that the said lords commissioners may then give their determination accordingly . ' This judgment speaks for itself : it is impossible by any torture of interpretation , to use the phrase ascribed to lord Thurlow , to conceive that it was a decision of the general point of law . If 469 your ldps had the evidence of the whole fifteen judges , that it was so considered , the tenour of the judgment is such , that they could only impress upon your mind astonishment at the misconception that had taken place . But is this the case ? It is true the justice clerk informs you , that this is his recollection of what passed ; that the lord president states to you , 'That if any gentleman thinks that the case of Tingwall was decided on specialties , and not upon the general question regarding the power and duty of the court under the construction of the act 1707 , he deceives himself ; for it is most certain , the cause was argued and decided upon the general question alone . ' These learned judges were both of them counsel in the cause . It is admitted , that the general question of law was alone argued from the bar ; and it is natural , that impressed with a recollection of their argument , they should at a distant period of time fancy that the judgment was founded on it , and not on the specialties contained in the record ; but what account did this very lord president give of the decision at a recent period after it took place ? Lord Newton tells you , that so far was the judgment of the house of lords from being considered as a decision on the general merits , that he was 'informed by a right honourable counsel ,
