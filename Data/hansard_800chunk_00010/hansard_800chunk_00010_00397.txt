no credit on their prudence : he was , however , apprehensive that they had also subjected themselves to the danger of imputations on their public spirit and patriotism : not that a doubt-was entertained by him 666 of the zeal and determination with which those immediately interested in the success of this petition would assist in repelling an invading enemy ; but , considering the time of presenting it , and the terms in which it was expressed , it seemed evident that there was a disposition to operate , if possible , upon the fears of those to whom it was addressed . The petitioners appeared to be not unwilling to do themselves some injustice for the sake of their object ; and it was accordingly intimated that the ardour and animation at least , with which they might perform their duties at a period of the utmost emergency , might depend , in some degree , upon the fate of their petition . For the honour of those by whom such a condition might seem to be held forth , he could not but question its reality . As well might the soldier refuse to march in the face of the enemy , or the sailor to weigh the anchor , without a previous stipulation for an increase of pay and emolument . It was therefore not to be supposed that the respectable individuals to whom alone the objects of this petition were important , could so discredit themselves , as thus to bargain with their country ; it was not to be supposed that , because by their own refusal to take the oath of supremacy , they were debarred from holding the highest situations of judicial , military , and political authority and power , they could lose sight of the unexampled beneficence which they have experienced ? from their sovereign ; and by withholding , or abating their exertions in his support , impair his means of protecting his dominions , and his crown , and the liberties and property of themselves , and their fellow subjects , against the malignant and implacable enemy of every independent stale in the world.â€”Having thus commented on the time and mode of bringing forward this petition , lord S. proceeded to observe upon its object , which , he said , was narrow , selfish , and delusive , inasmuch as it held out the prospect of benefit to the many , without the possibility of ad vantage ; except to a very few . The term emancipation was not indeed to be found in the petition , nor had it been used by the noble baron ; but it was still employed as an instrument of deception ; and no doubt could be entertained that it had been successful in raising those hopes and expectations , which could alone account for the numerous signatures subjoined to the petition . But , in fact , between its real object , and the condition of the great body 667 of the Catholics of Ireland , there was no relation whatever : they would remain in the same state if the prayer of the petition was complied with : their restlessness and discontent arose from an imperfect state of civilization , and from its concomitants , poverty , ignorance , and bigotry . To them it would afford no relief to enable Roman Catholics to hold the highest situations in the army , the navy , the law , and the state ; nor would it even administer to their gratification , as there were few subsisting ties , which connected the higher with the inferior classes of the community , and in such a state of things what could be the inducements to sympathy and attachment ? The peasant could take little interest in any accession of honor and emolument to a superior , whom he scarcely knew but by name , and whom he regarded with no other feelings than those inculcated by his priest , the sole object of his respect , and by whom alone he was influenced and controuled . The multitude were therefore
