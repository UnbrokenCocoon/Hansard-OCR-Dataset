. 4l . 14s . 6d . per cent . The charges per annum of the interest and sinking fund on the three loans would be as follows : The Loan raised in Ireland £45,562 The Bank , of Ireland Loan 75,000 The Loan raised in England 159,000 Total 280,462 In order to raise this sum , it would be necessary to impose new Taxes , and he trusted the committee would concur with him in opinion , that it would be better to effect this not by imposing a number of small taxes , but rather to lay on a large tax at once , in such a way as would least affect the community in Ireland . It was well known that in Ireland , as well as in England , the distilleries evaded the malt duties in a considerable degree , by distilling from raw corn ; he therefore proposed to extend to all raw corn used in distillation , the duties at present imposed upon malt . It was also his intention to propose an additional duty on foreign spirits im- 830 ported into Ireland . These sums , together with the saving in the management of the Debt , would more than cover the Charges of the Interest , and Sinking Fund of the three Loans , viz . : Extension of the Malt Duties to raw Corn , & c £333,000 Duty on Foreign Spirits 22,500 Savings in the Management of the Public Debt 7,500 Total 363,000 There were certain arrangements dependent on the measure now before parliament , relative to the Distillation from Sugar , with which he would not then trouble the committee .

Upon which , observed , that he could not agree in opinion with the right hon . gent . ( Mr. Foster ) , that the Loan for 1,250,000l . which he had negociated with the Bank of Ireland , was entitled to those terms of approbation which he had bestowed upon it . On the contrary , he considered it as one highly disadvantageous to the public . For , if the right hon . gent . had borrowed this sum in London , instead of the public having to pay an interest at the rate of 5l . per cent , they would only have had to pay 4l . 14l . 6d . the rate at which the Chancellor of the Exchequer of this country , a few days ago , made the loan for England . On this sum of 1,250,000l . the annual difference in the amount of interest between the two rates is no less than 3,438l . so that the public will actually sustain an annual loss to this amount , because this loan has been borrowed from the Bank
