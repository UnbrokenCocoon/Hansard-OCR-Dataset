of good faith , common interest , and friendly connection , in which the nabobs stood towards the British government . Such , I say , would be the inference from the very existence of a secret correspondence , between parties so circumstanced as the nabobs and Tippoo Sultaun . The one , our ally , united to us by every tie that can be supposed binding on man ; the other , instigated by the most inveterate hate , and in the very act of meditating , if not preparing hostilities against us.—If this interference be a just one , the object of inquiry is , next , whether there is any thing in the contents of the papers themselves to invalidate or destroy it , or whether they are not , ( as I think they will be found to be when fairly examined , ) calculated to confirm and support it , and when combined with subsequent events , to establish it beyond the possibility of refutation.—The hon . bart has objected to these papers as being extracts . It is true , sir , they are so ; but that they are fairly taken , that they con- 332 vey the real sense and purport of the letters from which they are drawn , is proved , by their having been exhibited to the very parties who wrote them , who , disposed as they appear in the course of their examinations , to make the interpretations they give most favourable to the innocence of the nabobs , would undoubtedly have urged the objection , had they recollected or perceived the omission of any passages in the letters , likely to contradict the obvious tenor of the extracts produced.—To the general truth of what is related , ( though the expressions of personal regard may be , as indeed they are said to be , occasionally heightened , ) the very situation in which the vakeels stood , bear , as well as their subsequent examinations , ample testimony . It is scarce possible to imagine a statement , generally speaking , more to be relied on , than one made by ministers without any visible interest to deceive , intended for the guidance of their sovereign 's conduct , and of a sovereign too , of the character of the sultaun , whose vigilance would probably have detected , and whose arbitrary and cruel disposition would have led him to punish , any material deviation from the truth , with the last , and most exemplary severity.—The general style of these papers is that of extravagant adulation towards the sultaun , and had they contained no more , I should have , in a great measure , agreed with the hon . baronet , that they would have been little entitled to our attention , as we all know , that in the inflated terms of eastern correspondence , assurances of attachment and devotion , mean frequently nothing beyond common compliment , or at most , general friendship and good will.—But to come to the papers themselves : it is with regret I feel that the hon . baronet 's speech has imposed upon me the necessity of entering into a detail that may be fatiguing to the house ; but I can assure gentlemen , that I shall detain them no longer than maybe absolutely requisite to do justice to the cause I am supporting , and will call their attention to those points only , which appear to me most important in directing our judgment , and which are generally confirmed by the concurring testimony of the witnesses examined at Vellore.—The first paper , with which this singular correspondence commences , relates two separate conversations , which appear to have taken place between the nabob Wallajah , and the vakeels of Tippoo , on the 333 10th and 13th of June 1792 . It should seem , that from the events that had taken place in the course of the last years , the nabob entertained some doubts of the manner in which his proposition might be received , and that some management
