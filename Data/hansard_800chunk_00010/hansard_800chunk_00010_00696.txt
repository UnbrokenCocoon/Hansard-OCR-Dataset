; no effort has been wanting on the part of his majesty to support him in the arduous contest in which he is engaged.—The recent transactions in Spain and Italy have exhibited new and striking proofs of the unbounded and unprincipled ambition which actuates the common enemy of every established government and independent nation in the world.—His majesty views , with the liveliest interest , the loyal and determined spirit manifested by the Spanish nation , in resisting the violence and perfidy with which their dearest rights have been assailed.—Thus nobly struggling against the tyranny and usurpation of France , the Spanish nation can no longer be considered as the enemy of Great Britain ; but is recognised by his majesty as a natural friend and ally.—We are commanded to inform you that communications have been made to his majesty from several of the 1141 provinces of Spain , soliciting the aid of his majesty . The answer of his majesty to these communications has been received in Spain , with every demonstration of those sentiments of confidence and affection which are congenial to the feelings and true interests of both nations . And his majesty commands us to assure you that he will continue to make every exertion in his power for the support of the Spanish cause ; guided in the choice and in the direction of his exertions by the wishes of those in whose behalf they are employed.—In contributing to the success of this just and glorious cause , his majesty has no other object than that of preserving unimpaired the integrity and independence of the Spanish monarchy . But he trusts that the same efforts which are directed to that great object , may , under the blessing of Divine Providence , lead in their effects , and by their example , to the restoration of the liberties and the peace of Europe . '' A commission being read for proroguing the parliament , the Lord Chancellor , in his majesty 's name , and by virtue of the said commission , declared the parliament to be prorogued to the 20th of August next , to be then and there holden . began by observing , that he had with considerable anxiety waited till the last moment before the present session terminated , in the hope that his majesty 's ministers would see the propriety of adopting some mode whereby the sense of that house could be obtained on a subject of such universal interest as that of the present transactions in Spain . He thought that nothing was more to be desired than a distinct expression of the sentiment of that house upon a subject of such importance , and he could not help expressing his surprise that no communication had been made to the house by his majesty 's ministers , as it was upon such a communication that the declaration and the sentiments of that house could best be founded . When this subject was submitted to their consideration on a recent occasion by his right hon . friend ( Mr. Sheridan ) , he had felt it to be his duty frankly to state his objections to the impropriety and inexpediency of then agitating it , as he was apprehensive that the discussion at that time might have prematurely committed the whole Spanish nation with France ; 1142 since that period , however , the case was materially altered ; the Spanish nation was now committed with France ; never were a people engaged in a more arduous and honourable struggle , and he earnestly prayed God to crown their efforts with a success as final as those efforts were glorious ! He could not help thinking , that under such circumstances , it would have been well to have given an opportunity of manifesting to the brave Spaniards the sympathy that glowed in every British heart in favour of their cause , through the proper channel , the legitimate organ of the British people . He thought there had been reason to have expected that a message from the king would have been ere now brought down for a vote
