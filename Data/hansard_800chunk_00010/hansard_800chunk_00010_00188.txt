with the former intercourse . This letter is , like the other , marked with the fictitious name of Gholam Hussein , and addressed to Gholam Ally . The introduction of it is material only on account of the reference I have stated , and as it carries on the existence of the correspondence to so late a period preceding the Mysore war.—The impression of the nature of that reference is forcibly confirmed by the subsequent letter from Khader Newaz Khan , the confidential minister before alluded to , whose name appears more than once as the channel of communication between the nabobs and the vakeels . Adverting in this to his previous services , he congratulates himself , and thanks the Almighty , that the system of harmony and union between the two chosen of the Lord , ' ( meaning Tippoo Sultaun and Omdut ul Omrah , ) calculated to promote the happiness of God 's people , and which his labours had been employed in establishing , had acquired the requisite degree of stability and firmness . The authenticity of this letter is fully supported by the oral testimony ; nor is there any thing that has a tendency to invalidate the obvious inference resulting from it . It stands then as a convincing testimony , that whatever that mysterious and enigmatical connection , established under the name of union and harmony , really was , it was in force and operation up to the year 1797 ; that the same sentiments which impelled Omdut ul Omrah to participate in , and conduct the intercourse during the lifetime of his father ; the same supposed interests , the same attachment to the cause of the sultaun that had previously governed and animated his exertions , accompanied him , undiminished , to the throne , where he waited only for an opportunity favourable to his friendship , and an emergency in which the fidelity he had solemnly promised could be manifested with effect.—Though many additional remarks on the contents of the several papers of the correspondence obviously present themselves , I will not further exhaust the patience of the house by continuing them ; and in here concluding this part of the subject I only regret that a sense of justice to the question before us should have made me feel it a duty to dwell on it so much at length . But , sir , on the de- 346 gree of conviction resulting from these documents , much must depend . The inferences I have deduced , the conclusions I have drawn , the impressions I have endeavoured to inforce , I must leave to the judgment of the house . I can only say , that to mine they are decisive , and that each suspicion the existence of such a correspondence excites , appears to me to derive validity and confirmation from every step we advance in examining its contents . All the facts they discover are so far from being weakened by the oral evidence , ( if indeed such evidence could weaken the authority of any written documents ) that they are more distinctly corroborated and established . Without troubling you by dwelling particularly on the evidence taken at Vellore , but leaving it to those observations which must strike any mind from the most cursory attention to it , allowing also to the witnesses whatever credit can be claimed for them , ( and some credit I admit must undoubtedly be given ) there is still nothing of moment that can be collected from them , that either in fact , or by inference , goes to refute or weaken any material part . By what has been stated from the papers , as well as by the concurring testimony of the vakeels , it is proved , that a correspondence embracing political objects was carried on , that a connection under the mysterious and indefinite terms of union and harmony was proposed on the part of the nabobs of the Carnatic , and accepted by Tippoo Sultaun ; that for the purpose of continuing their correspondence , when the departure
