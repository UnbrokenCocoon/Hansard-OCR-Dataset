that year sir A. Campbell entered into a treaty with the nabob , prescribing in explicit terms the duties of the two contracting parties . The Company was solely intrusted with the military defence of the Carnatic , and the protection of the nabob from all his enemies . The nabob was bound to provide from the revenues an annual subsidy of nine lacs of pagodas , to be paid to the Company , and twelve lacs on account of his creditors ; and to put a stop to those mischiefs which had arisen from his intrigues and emissaries in the courts of native states in India , a clause was expressly introduced as follows ; His highness will not enter into any political negotiations or controversies with any state or power without the consent or approbation of the president in council of Fort St. George . From this period until 1790 , Mahomed Ally held the Carnatic under this treaty ; at that time lord Cornwallis engaged in the war against Tippoo Sultan , and at the close of it restored the country to the nabob , subject to the conditions of the treaty of 1792 , which is now the object of our deliberation . With the permission of the house , I will read the preamble of that treaty , as the best explanation of lord Cornwallis 's intentions in making it . Whereas a certain engagement , was entered into between the hon . English East India Company and his highness the nawaub of the Carnatic , bearing dale 24th February 1787 , for the purpose of cementing an everlasting friendship with each other , and of contributing mutually towards the defence of the Carnatic and countries dependant thereon ; whereby it was stipulated that the said Company should maintain a military force , and that the said nawaub should pay annually a certain sum of money arising from the revenues of the Carnatic , and should furnish sufficient and satisfactory security , under certain conditions expressed in the said engagement , for the regular payment of the sum stipulated to the said Company ; and whereas it appears by the representations of the said nawaub , that the resources of the Carnatic are not competent to enable him 783 to perform the stipulations in the said engagement ; and whereas it further appears that the security which the said nawaub agreed in the above-mentioned engagement to furnish for the due payment of the stipulated sum to the Company , is in its nature inadequate to the end intended ; wherefore the engagement aforesaid shall henceforth be considered by the contracting parties as annulled , and in lieu thereof the following articles agreed to . From this preamble to the treaty of 1792 , it will be seen , that in forming a new treaty with Mahomed Ally , lord Comwallis had two principal objects in view ; first , the generous one of relieving the nabob from a payment which he believed burthensome to him , and his lordship accordingly reduced his annual payments from twenty-one to fifteen lacs of sicca pagodas ; secondly , to obtain a real security for the payment of the subsidy to the Company in all time to come . The security provided was the mortgage of particular districts , which were to be taken by the Company in the event of failure ; and that these districts might not be injured by that system of extortion and usury by which the people had been so cruelly oppressed , and the Carnatic so much exhausted , it was stipulated that his highness should not , on any account , grant tunkaws , and in order to render the breach of this part of the treaty more improbable and difficult , it was further stipulated , that any tunkaws which might be granted should become void , in event of the districts coming into the Company 's hands ; thus-providing a double security against the violation of this article of the treaty : the first part of the clause pledging the nabob 's faith as our ally , the last part
