right to tithe for which the church has uniformly contended . On the other hand , it has been said , that this right was abandoned by the protestant clergy : the authority of John Knox has been cited . The power of the titulars , 452 and the circumstance that the parochial clergy had only the benefices of value under 300 merks conferred on them by the legislature , have been urged as proving , that , after the reformation , the divine right to tithe had been abandoned.—As bearing on the present case , all these considerations appear immaterial : whatever might be the rights of the parochial clergy , it is perfectly clear , that , antecedent to the year 1617 , they had been reduced to extreme poverty . For in that year an act of parliament passed , which describes the state of the church in terms not equivocal ; the preamble states : 'Considering that there be divers kirkes within this kingdome not planted with ministers , wherethrough ignorance and atheism abounds amongst the people ; and that many of those that are planted , have no sufficient provision or maintenance appointed to them , whereby the ministry are keept in poverty and contempt . ' Though this act of parliament is not referred to in the act 1707 , out of which this question , arises , it has been dwelt upon in argument by both parties , as being the first act appointing a commission , intrusted with the charge of providing for the parochial clergy out of the tithes of the church.—In the present case , for the better understanding of the act 1633 , it appears to me only necessary to state , that it provided that 500 merks of money , or five chalders of victual , should be the minimum ; that 1000 merks of money , or 10 chalders of victual , should be the maximum , given as stipend to the clergy ; and that after such a provision was made , the holder of the tithes should be quieted in his possession for ever.—It is proper also to remind your ldps , that another commission was appointed in the year 1621 , similar in principle and effect to that established in the year 1617.—It is material also , here to observe , what indeed was admitted at the bar , that the stipends given to the clergy , under the provisions of these acts , were to be paid either out of the tithes held by the bishops , or the tithes held by titulars ; for the parsonage tithes were already the property of the church ; and the lands held 'cum decimis inclusis , ' never were subjected to any provision for the maintenance of the clergy.—That such were the circumstances when the general arrangement of Charles 1 , concerning the benefices of the clergy and the situation of the tithe was carried into execution by the acts of parliament which passed in 1633 , is admitted by both 453 parties at your bar . And as this case appears to me very much to depend upon the true and sound interpretation of one of these acts , viz . chap . 19 , it is necessary shortly to allude to the public feeling on the subject of tithe at the time in which it was passed.—King Charles 1 , soon after coming to the throne , evidently appears to have wished that some general arrangement should be made on this subject . It seems to have been his intention , if possible , to settle the disputes existing about tithes , in a manner advantageous to all parties ; submissions were entered into in the most formal manner , and the result of the award , carried into execution by the acts passed in 1033 , was an arrangement apparently beneficial to all who were concerned—The crown got a right of purchasing the superiority from the titular , at the rate of ten years purchase , and an annuity of six per cent , out of the tithe.—The titular was quieted in
