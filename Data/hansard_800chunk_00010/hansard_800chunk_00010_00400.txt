gradually and completely done away . Perfect toleration was now enjoyed by all the inhabitants of the united kingdom , and in Ireland there was no other distinction between the Catholic and the Protestant , but that the Act of Supremacy not being wholly repealed , the former , in consequence of his refusal to take the oath which it prescribed , was not qualified to hold the highest situations of judicial , military , and political power.— Much , however , remained to be done for Ireland , and much he trusted would be accomplished by the provident and superintending wisdom of government and of parliament . The evils inherent in her present condition were poverty and ignorance ; which could only be obviated by industry and instruction . This was the emancipation which the state of Ireland called for , and without which all other expedients would be fruitless.—A system of education comprehending the children of Protestants and Papists , and the utmost possible encouragement to the Protestant Clergy to reside on their benefices , ( for which latter purpose , he was happy to observe that a bill was then on the table ) would lay the foundation of a gradual change of habits , and manners , the most 671 favourable to the welfare of individuals , and to the interests of the state.—It was , he was convinced , by such means only as he had last adverted to , that we could hope to approach the object , of which all their lordships must be desirous , namely , that of rendering Ireland a Protestant community . This could never be effected by measures of severity towards the Catholics : persecution had never made a real proselyte . With these measures he should wish to combine a moderate provision , at the charge of the state , for the deserving part of the Roman Catholic Clergy ; with a view to the relief of individuals , to whom the expence of contributing to the support of two establishments was burthensome and vexatious , and for the purpose too of convincing the Catholic Clergy , that by peaceable , and becoming conduct , they would entitle themselves to the consideration and favour of the government . On the proposal for a modification of Tythes , he acknowledged that he had not formed his opinion ; but he was glad to find that it was a subject to which ministers were turning their serious attention.—Lord Sidmouth concluded , by expressing his conviction , that it was not by such a measure as that now proposed , that Ireland was to be tranquillized ; but by a comprehensive system , founded upon a just view of the condition of the great body of the people . The history of the last thirty years had afforded continual proofs of the inefficacy of mere concession . Whenever a measure of that description had been urged , an assurance was given that it would be the last ; and yet it was invariably followed by a fresh demand . The prodigal concessions of 1793 , it was universally believed , had fully satisfied every possible claim : nevertheless , within the period of the last ten years , there had been two rebellions , the object of which , according to the acknowledgment of those by whom they were excited , and conducted , was not Catholic Emancipation , nor the redress of any alledged grievances ; but separation from Great Britain . This unhappy bias could only be changed by correcting the ignorance , promoting the industry , and improving the conditions of the great mass of the people : thereby creating that confidence and sense of security , which by encouraging the residence of the landlord would bring him into habits of communication with his tenants and dependants ; and thus establish those links that , belong to a well conditioned state of society , and 672 which in this country happily connect the higher with the lower orders of the community . But he objected to the measure now proposed because it did not go to the
