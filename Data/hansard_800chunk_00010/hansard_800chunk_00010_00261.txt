instead of nine.—In opposition to all this body of evidence , tending to explain the real meaning of the Act 1633 , on consulting my notes , I can only find two circumstances which have been urged by the Respondents that appear to me to bear upon the question.—First , it has been said , that the act 1633 could not have been understood as an ultimate settlement of the stipend of the clergy , because , by the act 1641 , a power is given to grant a further augmentation ; and the ground upon which this proposition was submitted to your ldps , is , that in the year 1633 there were general powers given to the commissioners to go below the minimum , and that in this act they are only empowered to go below the minimum in special cases , which was a provision more favourable for the clergy . To this circumstance , however , I can give no weight ; nothing has been brought to shew , that this is not in itself a specification of those very cases , and of the whole of them , with regard to which the exception had been made in general terms in the year 1633 : on the contrary , from the respect paid to the act 1633 , by the whole tenour of the act 1641 , the presumption arises that it was only a specific enumeration of the cases understood to be generally alluded to in the act 1633.—Secondly , it is said , that the rescinded act 1649 is also more favourable to the clergy than the act 1633 ; and this observation is grounded on the circumstance , that in the act 1633 , where victual can not be given to the clergyman , the conversion is settled at the rate of 100 merks for a chalder of victual , whereas by the act 1649 , it was settled at a sum between 100 merks and 100 punds : if , however , this act is consulted , it will be seen that it in noway relates to churches which had antecedently received an augmentation under any former commission ; and that it alludes alone to churches which had not been aug- 460 mented : indeed , the words of that act recite , and specially regard the provisions of the act 1633 , as a conclusive settlement . To these objections , therefore , I can attach no importance.—I have now stated the grounds on which I have formed a decided opinion , that the act 1633 gave to the landholder a clear right to his tithes , after a due provision to the clergyman being once modified , unburdened with any future obligation to provide increased stipends ; and I have in vain looked for any enactment in the acts of the 23d and 30th of the year 1690 , and the 24th of the year 1693 , the other acts referred to the act 1707 , which interfere with or invalidate the right so conferred.—With regard to the second question , how far the act 1633 , or the other acts of parliament referred to in the act 1707 , bars the clergy from obtaining more than one augmentation , provided that augmentation had not been obtained by collusion , or is not below the minimum ; it is to be observed that if the proposition I have endeavoured to establish , viz . that the act 1633 , in so far as relates to tythes belonging to the titular , and to tythes belonging to the bishop , gave a complete right to what remained , after the stipend was once modified , is well-founded , it flows as a corollary that no subsequent augmentation could be granted.—In relation to the parsonage tythe , sold under the act 1690 , I own that is the subject on which , from the discussion at the bar , I think your ldps have received the least satisfactory information : in this case , however , you are relieved from all consideration of the tythe thus circumstanced , as it is
