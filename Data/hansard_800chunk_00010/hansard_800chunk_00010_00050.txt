of their lordships of the 18th March last . rose to express his wish , that the noble viscount would not be dissuaded from persisting in his motion , even if the papers he had moved for should not be produced to the extent he had desired . There would still remain matter of great importance in the object of the motion , and which nearly concerned the honour and character of this country . It appeared , that many of the Danish ships which had been detained previous to the declaration of hostilities , had been brought before the Admiralty Courts , and had been ordered to be released ; but that on the declaration of war being issued , these same ships were again detained , and afterwards condemned . Was not this stimulating the 87 avarice and rewarding the rapine of individuals ? Against such violence and injustice he could not but raise his voice , and that more earnestly than against the Droits of Admiralty , which were now ascertained to amount to more than the enormous sum stated on a former occasion by the noble viscount . He must therefore again request his noble friend not to relinquish the object of his motion , which was to put an end to so flagrant a system of plunder and injustice , as that to which he had been just alluding . would not now enter into the discussion of the question which his noble friend 's motion must involve on a future day . He should only remind the noble viscount of the circumstance of the detention of some Prussian ships under similar circumstances , when the noble viscount himself was a member of the government at the time . He should at present only wish , that when the Papers were produced , the noble viscount in giving notice of the day on which he should bring on his niotion , would have the goodness to state somewhat more precisely the nature of the motion he intended to make , as the subject on which it turned was one of great magnitude and extent . in explanation complained , that ministers seemed to think of nothing but crimination and recrimination . He blamed the conduct of no particular minister , but only reprobated a system of iniquity which had grown into practice of late years . assured his noble friend that he would not abandon the motion . When he alluded to it yesterday , he had observed that it had nothing of crimination in view , but that it would only go to stop the progress of the practice that had been resorted to and in his opinion was highly unjust , and to prevent further injustice being done to individuals . Whenever he should have the honour to bring forward that motion , he should not despair of being able to prove , that the object in its nature was wholly different from the case to which the noble secretary had referred . As , however , some delay might occur in producing the returns he had moved for , he must defer his motion to a more distant day than Tuesday next . in pursuance of his notice , rose 88 to move for leave to bring in a Bill to accelerate the examination and auditing of the Accounts of the Office of the Paymaster-General of his Majesty 's Forces . It was not requisite that he should trespass long on the house , to show the necessity of a measure of this description . Since the passing of the bill , known by the name of Mr. Burke 's Bill , only five accounts from the office of the Paymaster-General had been delivered in , only one of which had been examined . That one related to part of the year 1782 , so that there , were accounts laying unexamined and unaudited for the last 25 years . He did not attribute this circumstance to any neglect in those who had held the office which he now had the honour to hold , or to any neglect in the office
