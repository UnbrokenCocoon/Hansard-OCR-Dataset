of France to use every means in his power to conquer these countries there could not remain a doubt : of his formidable power , his prowess , and his talents , the world were witnesses ; and if valour , talents , and prowess , could give any man claims to royal power , it must be acknowledged no man ever merited more the title of Emperor of France . Of his morals , or the means he sometimes used to compass his ends , he would say nothing ; but as a conqueror , it must be admitted he was equal , if not superior , to Cæsar or Alexander . Such an enemy , armed with the means he possessed , was not to be viewed without apprehension : he had already conquered much the greater part , if not the whole , of Europe . There might be those who flattered themselves he had work enough cut out for him in Spain , to divert his attention from this country ; but it was to be feared the spark lately struck in that kingdom , had kindled but a feeble flame , and of short duration ; for how was it to be expected , a people , whose government had treacherously conspired with its own enemy to surrender them to French slavery and rivet their chains , could escape the machinations so long preparing against them , and terminated by the base and degrading surrender of the last crown of the Bourbon family , to which the Spanish monarch had proved himself a disgrace ? Every man must have seen from the moment that the Spanish army was divided , and one branch sent to Portugal and the other to the opposite frontier , while a French force was suffered to march into the heart of the country and make themselves masters of the capital , that the people were betrayed . That was the mo- 950 ment when any interference on the part of this country might have been successful ; but now , he feared , it was too late , and that scarcely a hope remained that the struggles of the Spanish people would be successful.—As to Sweden , he feared there was as little room to hope for a successful issue in that quarter ; or that the Swedish power , however praiseworthy the magnanimous and princely spirit of the monarch , could have any chance of holding out against the combined force of Russia and France . Those countries reduced under the power of that man , whose sleepless activity and vigilant ambition , marked his views as nothing short of the subjugation of Europe , perhaps of the world , he would then possess the whole force of Europe , and command every port from the Baltic to Cadiz , to detach its force against us . It was , he thought , quite impossible to expect any thing else than that his success against Spain and Sweden , would be immediately followed by an attempt on Great Britain or Ireland ; and of the latter country , he would only say , that though it was the left arm of the empire , it would require the force of the right to keep down rebellion , in case of such an attack . It was notorious that the French emperor , on a landing in that country , looked to the assistance of a numerous party , whose object it always was to effect a separation from this ; for though the great body of the people were loyal , and attached to British government , still there was a numerous party in Ireland ever since the days of queen Elizabeth , with whom separation from this country was a favourite project , and who only postponed the attempt for want of a favourable opportunity in the aid of some foreign power . This was the main purpose , disguised under the clamour of Catholic emancipation , for which , as was acknowledged by one of the leaders of the last Irish rebellion to the Secret Committee of
