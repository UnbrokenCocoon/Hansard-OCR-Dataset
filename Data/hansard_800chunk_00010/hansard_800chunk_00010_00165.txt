had been impelled to submit it to their consideration by a sense of justice towards individuals , and by an ardent anxiety for the honour of the country . The inducements to take this step , he felt to be the more urgent , on account of some new doctrines and opinions , unwarrantable , as he thought , in themselves , and most dangerous in their tendency , which were too likely to gain ground , as they appeared to be countenanced by the declared sentiments and evident policy of the government . It seemed to be imagined , that the flagitious conduct of France , and the consequences which had resulted from it , had absolved us from the obligation of a strict adherence to those principles of good faith and justice , that have been heretofore considered as necessary to keep together the great fabric of civil society ; and further , that the existence of a gigantic power , created and maintained by violence and fraud , not only gave the right of resisting and retaliating upon that power , by means similar to those by which it had been established , but also justified us , with a view to our own immediate interests , in employing the same weapons against unoffending states , not parties in our quarrel : in fine , that , for the purpose of enabling ourselves to maintain an equal contest , with France , and to counteract the danger arising from her extended dominion , it was become necessary for us to follow her 311 example.—Against such doctrines he would ever protest , in the name of all that had hitherto given dignity to our councils , or lustre to public or private character ; of all that , by making this country the object of just and general confidence , had contributed to establish its reputation , and to preserve and extend its influence and power . He well remembered that , in the year 1794 , we were exhorted from the throne , to render our conduct a contrast to that of our enemies : an exhortation worthy of the high quarter whence it came , and which made upon his mind a deep and lasting impression . In proportion as our adversary extended his systematic violation of all the principles of public law and natural justice , it should be our object , by our conduct towards other states , to manifest more strongly , if possible , our determination to observe and to uphold them . He , indeed , could command nearly the whole population of the continent : but the spirit by which it was to be actuated might depend , in a great degree , upon ourselves . Let it therefore be our endeavour to influence that spirit , by commanding universal confidence in our honour and good faith , as well as respect for our naval and military power : let it appear that , at least in this country , justice would find a sanctuary until the storm was overpast , and the authority of public law could again be diffused throughout the civilized world . It had been under these impressions , that he had so frequently felt it to be a duty to address the house in the course of the present session : it was under these impressions that he brought foward the resolutions , which he had now to propose ; and he would only add , that he should consider the present , as one of the most fortunate , because he was convinced it would be one of the most useful days of his life , if the principles upon which they were founded , and the measures they suggested , sanctioned as they were by the practice of our ancestors , and by recorded opinions of the highest authority , should meet with their lordships approbation and support.—Lord Sidmouth then proposed the following Resolutions ; I . `` That it appears to this house that ships and other property , to a large number , and amount , belonging to subjects of his
