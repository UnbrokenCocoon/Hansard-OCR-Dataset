deluded and misled by being made use of for the attainment of an object , in which they had no interest , and the accomplishment of which would not have the effect of removing any of the material causes of what was to be deplored in the present state of Ireland . This being the case , it was in vain to pretend that a measure , so limited and partial in its operation , could possibly effect its professed purpose of conciliating and satisfying the great body of Irish Catholics . It might produce present exultation , which would however be followed by lasting disappointment.—But this measure was not only to be the instrument of conciliation , but the reward of loyalty : and yet when this inducement was mentioned it was usually accompanied with a cautionary , if not a menacing intimation with respect to the probable consequences of refusal . Over the past he wished to draw a veil , admitting however that nothing could be more unjust than to attribute to the Catholics , exclusively , the disaffection and turbulence by which Ireland had been convulsed : but in looking to the future , it was not unreasonable to consider how political power , if obtained , was likely to be exercised by those , who , it should seem , were not to be implicitly relied upon for the active performance of their most momentous duties , if it was withheld . He had already said that he neither did nor could suppose that such would be the conduct of the Catholics ; but there 668 was evidently a desire to give them the benefit of the apprehension which , such intimations were calculated to produce . The objections to such an innovation appeared to him to be strong , and insurmountable.—Religion was the great bond of society : there must therefore be a religion of the state . This was peculiarly necessary in this country , where the reformed religion was an essential part of the constitution , and identified with our limited monarchy : they had always suffered together : puritanism , and democracy overwhelmed both in the time of the Commonwealth ; and in that of James 2nd both were endangered by the attempt to introduce popery and arbitrary power . It had therefore been a part of the wise policy of our ancestors to strengthen and protect the ecclesiastical establishment , and with it our civil constitution , by requiring that those persons who held certain offices of trust should give proofs of their fidelity and attachment to the church , as well as to the stale . Upon this basis it was that the policy of religious tests was founded ; and without a condemnation of the conduct of our ancestors at the periods of the Reformation , and the Revolution , and at the accession of the house of Brunswick , it was impossible to depart from it.— These were his general objections : the special and detailed reasons which led him to resist this motion were , That there was no instance in which Protestants and Papists had agreed in the exercise of political power in the same state : —That the attempt must occasion continual competition , and contentions the most violent ; particularly in a country , where , by its constitution , so many situations were elective , and in which the weight of numbers was , with persons of one persuasion , and that of property with those of another : —That it appeared to be highly dangerous to render any persons capable of holding the highest situations of political power , who in the conscientious exercise of it were liable to be directed and controuled by an authority foreign from , and occasionally adverse to , the supreme authority of the state under which they lived : —That the consciences , and conduct of persons of the Roman Catholic persuasion being thus under the influence and guidance of others , they could not possibly be sure of themselves , as was particularly exemplified by James 2d , who upon his accession , declared
