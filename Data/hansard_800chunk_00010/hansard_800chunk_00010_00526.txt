the fate of the motion , and that no inconvenience had been shewn to result from the business being confined to a single proctor . asserted , that so far from the question being indifferent to the navy , there was a general outcry , he might say , in the navy respecting it . He was willing to concur in all the praises which had been bestowed upon the person at present holding the office of king 's proctor . But abuses had taken place before he filled the office , and such abuses might occur again . The hon . and learned gent . might as well argue , that it would be proper and fit for him to conduct every cause in the court of king 's bench , as that one proctor should engross the whole business of the court of appeals . Formerly two clerks did the business of the house of commons , and continued to do so till the time of the union , when the increase of business made it necessary to have a third . But the hon . and learned gent , upon his principles , would argue , that because two had been sufficient at one time , they would be sufficient still . opposed the motion , because it had not been shewn that the delays which took place , in the decision of causes in the courts of prize jurisdiction arose from a want of proctors . On the contrary , it would be easy to shew , that the interests of the captors were materially benefited by a vast number of causes passing through the hands of a single person . thought that the best time to reform the constitution of a court of justice was when the offices in the court were respectably and unexceptionably filled ; because , at such a time , all personal and party motives must necessarily be excluded . He did not pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode 876 of proceeding in the admiralty courts ; but he conceived it to be a very extraordinary principle , and one contrary to that which was recognised in all other courts , that one person , however able and however distinguished either by his talents or integrity , should engross the whole practice of the court . said , that if it had occurred in times past , that the king 's proctor had been employed on both sides of a cause , such regulations were now adopted , as to preclude the possibility of its happening in future . argued , that if the king was dominus litis when there was only one proctor , he would be equally dominus litis when there were three proctors , and that therefore there was no objection to the motion of his gallant friend , from its tending to alter the principle upon which causes were conducted in the prize courts . And if it had no injurious tendency in this way , he thought it desirable to adopt a measure which would be highly satisfactory to such a numerous and meritorious class of persons as the officers of the royal navy . made a short reply , in which he stated , that some causes had been pending in the admiralty courts more than ten years , and that a majority had been pending more than seven years . He should think that he was wanting in his duty if he did not take the sense of the house upon the motion which he had the honour to propose.â€”The house then divided upon the hon . baronet 's motion : said , that during the last twenty or thirty years it had been his lot to have some experience in the administration of the Criminal Law ; he should therefore be wanting in his duty to the public , as well as respect to his learned friend , if he omitted to pay what attention he could to the present bill ; and he was desirous to state a few observations upon it before the Speaker left the chair , because
