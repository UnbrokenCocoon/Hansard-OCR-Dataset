the possession of his property , which had been disputed by the crown.—The landholder got rid of the grievance of drawing the tithe in kind , his tithe was to be valued , and he was only to be assessed in perpetuity in a fifth part of the then value of the lands ; he obtained , also , a right , if he chose it , to purchase his tithe so valued , at the rate of nine years purchase.—The clergy were on their part benefited by the minimum being advanced from 500 to 800 merks , and the commission appointed were no longer restrained in relation to the maximum of what was to be given as a proper stipend for the minister.—In considering the act of parliament which passed in the year 1633 , the words of the act , as well as the history of the times , have been relied upon as proving , that it meant to enact , and did actually enact , a final settlement of all claims concerning the tithes ; and there can be little doubt , that words stronger or more appropriate to produce this impression could hardly have been selected.—The preamble recites what had been the king 's object from the commencement of his reign , and describes the enactments to be , 'for the finishing and full perfection c of the glorious work anent the teinds and 'maintenance of ministers'—an accurate description of the law , if it was meant to settle once for all the state in which the parties were permanently to stand ; but a very false representation of it , if it meant only to provide for the sale to the landholder of that , which it was to be understood the parochial clergy had a right to 454 claim , the moment the purchase was effected.—This act ordains the tithes to be valued , and gives to the commissioners power , after the valuation , to appoint a constant local stipend for ministers : the term constant has been dwelt upon by the respondent in this cause : much reliance has been placed on the circumstance , that perpetual is dropt , which was used in the former acts , and that the word constant is here resorted to : between these a distinction has been made ; perpetual is said to be properly used in relation to time ; constant , as applicable to regular payment : but it is impossible to conceive that there is any real distinction betwixt the meaning of these words , as used by the legislature : and if the act itself is examined , it is clear that , the word constant was not used for the purpose of securing the regular payment of the stipend , as that is afterwards especially provided for in a subsequent clause of the act , when the commissioners are directed to 'set down the security in favour of the ministers , so far as concerns the maintenance assigned to them , for good , thankful , and timeous payment of the rate of teind . '—The price for which the tithe was to be sold by the titular to the landholder , subsequent to the clergyman 's provision , has been relied on by both parties : by the respondent it has been said , that nine years purchase was a very inferior price : he has argued , that it is so stated by Mr. Erskine , who says , that the tithes were sold at that inferior price from the circumstances of their being subject to future augmentations . '—By the appellant it has been contended that the price was adequate , that the interest of money was at that period at ten per cent , which was evidently the case as appears from the act 1633 providing that the lender of money should receive only eight per cent , and that the remaining two should go to the crown : the authority of Mr. Laing has also been relied on : his history has been quoted in opposition to Mr. Erskine , and the parties have
