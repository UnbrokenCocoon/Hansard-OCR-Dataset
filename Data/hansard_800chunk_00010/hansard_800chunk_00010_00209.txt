have we the smallest intention of withdrawing that support ; but it must be remembered that the sword , that most prominent and essential mark of sovereignty , is exclusively in the hands of the Company ; the nabob can form no alliance , either offensive or defensive , with foreign powers.—Even in the last treaty with Tippoo Sultaun , who had invaded the Carnatic , he is merely recognized as the friend and ally of the Company , and under their protection.—The hon . member contended , therefore , that , after what he had taken the liberty of stating to the house , he thought it could not be asserted , that the nabob of Arcot was an independent sovereign ; in fact , he was in a complete state of subordination , and totally dependent on the British power.—Under the view of this relation to the Company , the hon . member said he would examine what had been the nature of the conduct of the nabobs of Arcot , in fulfilling the obligations of their alliance with the British power . Mahomed Ally having failed in his first engagements , by which be was bound to liquidate the debt ; incurred by the war , which had established him as nabob of Arcot , he was called upon , in 1763 , to assign to the Company certain districts contiguous to Madrass , ( now called the Jaghire ) ; at first he refused , and wished to annex some conditions on the part of the Company ; but . lord Pigot , then governor , informed him , that it did not become a man , who owed to the Company the situation he enjoyed , to make any conditions under such cir- 377 cumstances ; that they did not take any tiring from him , for that they , in fact , were the givers and he the receiver.—After this transaction no material change appears to have taken place , until lord Macartney 's administration , which commenced in 1781 . That noble lord found our affairs in the peninsula of India in the most critical situation . Hyder Ally had invaded the Carnatic the preceding year , and it required the exertion of the greatest talents to extricate us from our difficulties.—Lord Macartney soon discovered , that the sole cause of all our embarrassments proceeded from our having most unwisely committed to the nabob the unr controuled management of the revenues.—In a letter to the secret committee , dated in Jan. 1784 , to which the hon . member was anxious to draw the attention of the house ; his lordship observed , that the first thing that struck him , as defective in your system , was the nature of the Company 's connection with the nabob , by which the resources of a province , garrisoned and defended by your forces in peace and war , was altogether in the controul of his highness , under a simple and insecure engagement of reimbursing , by instalments , the current charges of a certain proportion of those forces . This stipulation , even in peace , was , from the constant failure and backwardness in the nabob , a source of perpetual alarm to government , which often found itself absolutely unable to provide for the payment of the troops when it became due : but if such are the inconveniencies of this system in time of peace , how totally unprovided , weak and defenceless must be your situation under it in time of war . Lord Macartney , therefore , prevailed upon the nabob to confirm the assignment to the Company of the revenues of the Carnatic during the war , and until his debt was liquidated.—Unfortunately , however , the assignment was surrendered back to the nabob ; but two years had scarcely elapsed , before the embarrassments of government were greater than ever.—The court of directors , alarmed at the accounts from Madras , sent orders to sir Archibald Campbell , then governor , to make a treaty with the nabob , and to stipulate for a subsidy
