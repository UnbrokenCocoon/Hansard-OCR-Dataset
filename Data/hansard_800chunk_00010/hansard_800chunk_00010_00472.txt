. It appears to me quite evident , as I have already stated , that the intention of lord Cornwallis in framing this clause was , first to bind the faith of the nabob against the breach of it , and secondly to operate upon the fears of the tunkhadars , so as to restrain them from encouraging the nabob to the secret violation of it . But the men who had established an usurious connection at the durbar , saw from the moment that the treaty of 1792 was published , that the faithful execution of these clauses would destroy their profit , by putting an end to that secret influence which had so long alienated the nabob 's confidence from the local government of the Company , and precluded the possibility of any reform in his administration : it was therefore suggested to the nabob , that as the clause contained a specific penalty which attached only upon the money-lender , his highness might break his faith with the Company without fear of any evil consequence to himself ; and as he had always contended with eagerness and passion for delivering up to his pretended creditors his territories and his subjects , he again indulged in this inveterate habit . The calamitous process of these tunkaws has been most ably and minutely described by lord Hobart , who was continually embroiled with the durbar and its agents on account of the breach of this part of the treaty . Whoever has read the minute and the letter of lord Hobart to the court of directors , dated 15th September 1792 , will recollect , that lord Hobart regarded the granting of these tunkaws by the nabob as a fundamental violation of the letter and spirit of the treaty of 1723 . Nor was his lordship singular in this opinion ; I speak from personal knowledge when I say , that all the best servants of the Company entertained the same opinion ; and we know that the government at home and the court of di- 786 rectors , fully concurred in this conclusion , as appears from many of their public dispatches , and particularly the following , dated 5th June 1799 , to the government of fort St. George . We have been advised by the earl of Mornington , that the nabob continues to oppose a determined resolution to the modification of the treaty of 1792 , which has been repeatedly proposed to him . At the same time we observe that his highness has distinctly acknowledged that he is in the practice of raising money annually by assignments of the revenues of those districts which form the security for the payment of the Company 's subsidy . As this practice is unquestionably contrary to the letter , and subversive of the spirit , of that treaty , we direct , that immediately upon the receipt hereof you adopt the necessary measures for taking possession in the name of the Company of the whole or any part of the said districts , the revenue of which shall appear to be so assigned ; and that you continue to hold the same , and collect the rents thereof , in order that the Company may not in future be deprived of the only security which they possess under the before mentioned treaty , to answer any failure in the nabob in the discharge of his subsidy : you will immediately communicate to the nabob the determination we have come to , and the orders you have received relative to this point . I have entered into this detail to shew , that the interpretation subsequently put upon this article of the treaty ( and the conduct of Omdut ul Omrah in regard to it ) by marquis Wellesley and by lord Clive , was not an arbitrary or hasty construction of those noble lords ; but that it was the impartial concurring judgment of the Company 's best servants at fort St. George , of lord Hobart , of the court of directors , and of the board of controul , for a period of 7 years
