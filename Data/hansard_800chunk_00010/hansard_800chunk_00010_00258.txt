canvassed whether a lawyer or an historian was best authority for the market rate of interest in remote times . It is to be observed , however , that the interest of money is stated to have been at ten per cent , at this period , by the clergy themselves , in the answer drawn up by the committee of the general assembly , to the third and fourth reasons of dissent in the year 1750.—Independent of these , how-ever , are various circumstances , 455 which make me incline to the opinion that nine years purchase was deemed an adequate and full price for the tithe.—The superiorities sold to the crown under the same acts of parliament were valued at ten years purchase , which , like the tithe , conveyed an unimprovable annuity , with the sole distinction , that the feudal service , certainly worth one year 's purchase , went along with it.—This alone is strong evidence , that nine years purchase was , at that period of time , deemed a fair price for a quit-rent ; and on the authority of the king 's declaration , it appears that this was the light in which it was considered.—Hat it is not only upon the words and provisions of the act 1633 , and upon the contemporaneous exposition of it , derived from such authority , that , I am disposed to ground the opinion , that that act meant to give to the landholder a right to his tithe , unburdened with any obligation for increased allowance to the clergyman.—Circumstances at no very remote period from the passing of the act , as well as subsequent enactments of the legislature , appear to me to prove , that this was understood to be the real meaning of the act , beyond a possibility of doubt.—As the commission constituted under the act 1033 , was to endure during his majesty 's pleasure , in the year 1636–7 , a selection of persons from the nobility and clergy were appointed by his majesty to report whether this commission should be allowed to continue , or whether it , was then fit to put an end to it.—This report having been framed by the ecclesiastics , was agreed to , with some exceptions , by the ' lay lords : in the narrative it recites , 'that the clergy had from the first objected , that the tithes being the proper patrimony of the church , and reserved particularly in the Act of annexation , should be heretably disponed and sold to the heritor . ' Now it is impossible to conceive that the clergy should have this feeling if the tithes subsequent to sale , had been , as the respondent contends , equally liable to future augmentations as before the sale.—The act 1633 must have made on their minds a very different impression : they knew that both by the act 1617 , and the act 1621 , in express terms the tithe was discharged from all further claims , after payment of the sum modified ; they knew that the act 1633 had raised the minimum from 500 to 800 merks , that it had left the maximum indefinite ; and if they had thought , as the respondent contends , that the law was 456 altered to such an extent , as to reserve to the church a right to come back for re-augmentation as often as they thought fit , how is it possible that they should have felt themselves aggrieved or concerned , whether the tithe went to the landholder , or remained with the titular ? They might as well have opposed the sale of a titular 's right , as the sale from the titular to the landholder , if this had been deemed to be the sound interpretation of the law at that time.—But this is not all : in no part of this report is it stated as a ground for keeping up this commission , that the circumstances of the times might authorize the clergy to come back ; on the contrary , it is
