which augmentations , had it not been for this misconception of the law , would not have been granted . But it is impossible that any series of decisions , where the law was never controverted ; where from the silence of the heritors you have a right to suppose that they waived the defence which the law authorized ; can have the effect of altering what is the clear and undoubted law of the land.—In the course of the pleadings in this cause , various cases of second augmentations proceeding with the consent of the heritors , have been stated to your ldps . Auchendoire , Eden-kellie , at a very early period , afford instances of this nature ; and in the case of Lochearron in 1768 , a reaugmentation is especially given in respect of the heritors ' consent ; but in the pleadings in the case of Kirkden or Tingwall , in the opinions of the judges delivered in this last case , no allusion is made to precedents such as these , which , from the circumstance of consent , must have been deemed inapplicable : if a decision is given in one instance , the court may proceed , without inquiry , to act on the same principle in five hundred cases : it is only when the point is argued and fully canvassed , when the attention of the judges is called to it by the parties , that they have an opportunity of reviewing and reconsidering their judgment ; and on this subject I have the authority of the court of session itself ; for though betwixt the decision of the Kirkden and Tingwall cases there were no less than twenty cases decided , without the heritors arguing the legal defence , yet in the pleadings this circumstance is unnoticed , and it did not prevent the judges from coming to a unanimous decision , that the court had no right to re-augment , which is the only decision on the general point of law that ever was given , either in that court or in your ldps . ' house.—If I had any doubts , whether those decisions in which the general question of law never has been argued , ought to weigh with your ldps in the case you are now called upon to decide ; I should be relieved both by the numerous authorities of writers on this subject in the law of England , and from the decided opinions given on this point , no longer ago than last night , in your ldps ' house ; when it was clearly laid down , that though the 472 judgment of a court is the most respectable authority for what was the received sense of the law at the time it was given ; no series of decisions ever can do away the will of the legislature clearly expressed.—In submitting to your ldps the propriety of reversing this interlocutor , I feel great satisfaction in thinking that , if I prevail , your ldps ' decision will convey a mere declaration of your sense of the law , without in any degree allecting the interest of any of the parties . Your ldps have heard a great deal from the respondent , of the confusion that would be created from this circumstance : I do apprehend , however , that this can have no weight with you , in regulating your judgment . Even if the mischief was to be as extensive as it is represented , it might be a serious subject for your ldps ' consideration in your legislative capacity ; but , acting in your judicial capacity , it is a view of the question which ought to be excluded from your minds . In truth , however , it is a small portion of the eight hundred cases of augmentation granted under this erroneous view of the law , that could be affected by this decision : those augmented within these five years , are the only cases which,1 in consequence of your judgment , would be liable to be questioned.—No one can be more
