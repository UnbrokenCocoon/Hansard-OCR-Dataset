these happy lands ; and that the petitioners are too well aware of its universal importance ever to make any request in the smallest degree inconsistent with the agricultural prosperity of the country ; on the contrary , they feel it is at all times their duty , as it is their interest , to promote , as far as lies in their power , the improvement and extension of agriculture ; but they must confess they are not able to perceive how the stoppage of Distillation from Grain at this time can possibly interfere with that improvement ; they can not see why any alarm should be excited in well-informed and unbiassed minds by such a proposal ; they can not allow themselves to believe that calculation has been resorted to by those who have taken such alarm ; for surely it is manifest that our farmers will have to provide not only for the expected short importations into this country but also for the consumption of the West India colonies , which have now to look to Britain for the supply of a large proportion of their wants ; the additional quantity of grain required for those two purposes will , beyond doubt , greatly exceed all that is at any time consumed in the distilleries ; and it is a well-ascertained fact , that the prices of the different kinds of grain mutually operate on each other , so that the grower of barley need be under no apprehension ; nor should it be forgotten , that the proposed suspension of distillation from grain is not to be of a permanent , but merely of a temporary nature , and that the king in council is to be empowered again to permit the use of barley in the distilleries as soon as it falls below a fair and reasonable price ; farther the petitioners can not avoid expressing their satisfaction , that this well-timed measure will also tend to the relief of a very numerous and respectable part of the community , whose interests as British subjects ought not to be overlooked , the West India planters and merchants , who , possessing a considerable quantity of sugar beyond what is required for the consumption of 394 these kingdoms , will , by the use of that article as a temporary substitute for grain in the distilleries , be enabled to find a market for the surplus produce of their lands , and the country will thus be enabled to defeat the malicious purposes of our enemy , who equally withholds from us those markets where we could sell our surplus Sugar , and supply ourselves with what grain we stand in need of ; and therefore praying , that the house may adopt measures for suspending the use of grain by the distillers of Great Britain , and for restricting them to the use of sugar for a limited period . '' presented a Petition of the mayor , bailiffs , and burgesses of the town of Liverpool , in council assembled , setting forth , `` That the petitioners have seen , with feelings of considerable regret , advertisements for meetings in several parts of the kingdom , for the purpose of agreeing to petitions against the measure recommended by a committee of the house for a temporary suspension of the use of grain in the Distilleries , as calculated to prove injurious to the agricultural interest of the country ; and that , in the present state of our foreign relations , whilst so many of the ports of Europe are closed against us , rendering it impossible to procure a supply of corn from the continent of Europe , whilst in addition to this , the embargo which has taken place in the united states of America precludes us from obtaining any importations from thence , and whilst it remains an undisputed fact that this country has for many years past been dependant upon foreign supply for a considerable part of the subsistence of her inhabitants , more particularly in the populous town of Liverpool and county of Lancaster , the petitioners can
