of the abuses and corruptions known to exist ; abuses , which had long and successfully combated every measure , and baffled every attempt to restrain or correct them . I will select only the testimonies of sir Eyre Coole , of lord Macartney , and principally of lord Cornwallis , as stated in the papers on the table . Sir Eyre Coote 's marks in the strongest terms the effects of the nabob 's government on our affairs . The whole of the argument of lord Macartney on the subject of surrendering the assignment , proceeds upon the necessity of our possessing the whole administration of the country , if we would have any chance of security for our interests on the coast . The opinion of lord Cornwall is I shall read at length , as I am aware it is one of deserved weight in this house , and wherever the name and character of that great and excellent man is known . I have long seen , says his lordship , with very great concern , the various defects of the system of the government of the Carnatic ; and being extremely anxious that some plan should be introduced and established there that should be better adapted than any that has yet been tried , for securing the country against external enemies , and for promoting its general prosperity , 362 I have been hitherto prevented from making propositions to the nabob to that effect , more by my distance from the scene , or my other occupations , than by the consideration of the obstacles that might occur in the negociation with his highness , or of the disapprobation that interested and disappointed men might afterwards express of my conduct . The disadvantage and danger arising from the separation of the internal government , and management of the revenue of the country , from the responsibility for its defence , is so obvious , that if there had appeared to be the least chance of obtaining the nabob 's voluntary acquiescence , I should , without hesitation , have been ready to propose to him , as the plan best calculated for promoting his own interest and comfort , and the happiness of the inhabitants of the Carnatic , that be should entrust the company with the entire management of the country , in addition to the responsibility for its defence , under an engagement on then part , after allotting certain sums for public purposes , and for the gradual liquidation of his private debts , to pay him , regularly , a liberal portion of its revenues , for the maintenance of his family , and the support of his dignity.—On another occasion his lordship expresses himself as follows : —I must freely own that I could not venture to propose any plan , on the success of which I could have any firm reliance , unless the nabob could be induced , by a large annual revenue , regularly paid , and properly secured to him , to surrender the management of his country , for a long term of years to the Company.—The nabob 's age , his long connection with us , his rights to the possession of the country , which , however , without our assistance , would have been of little value to him , and exaggerated accounts of his former services may furnish topics for popular declamation , and may possibly engage the nation , upon mistaken ideas of humanity , to support a system of cruelty and oppression . But , whilst I feel conscious that I am endeavouring to promote the happiness of mankind , and the good of my country , I shall give very little weight to such considerations , and should conceive that I had not performed the duty of the high and responsible office in which you did me the honour to place me , if I did not declare , that the present mixed government can not prosper , even 363 in the best hands in which your part of it can be placed , and that , unless
