fully sensible that you have had on this occasion every advantage which could be derived from the learning and ingenuity of the bar : the pleadings on both sides have been conducted in a manner that must have convinced you that the labour bestowed in preparing , and the talent displayed in enforcing the arguments , left nothing more to be said on this important question.—In the pleadings of the counsel , the subject has been considered in two points of view : First , what are the powers given by the act 1707 , to the court of session , acting as commissioners for plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds . Secondly , how far your ldps ' house , by your decisions , and the court below , by its practice , has not precluded you from now considering the jurisdiction the law gave , and established the proposition that the court of session , acting as commissioners of teinds , have a power vested in them to augment at their discretion the livings of the clergy , till the whole tithe is appropriated to the church . The court of session was first authorized to judge on the subject of augmentation of ministers ' stipends , and other matters relative to tithe , by the 9th act of queen Anne , 1707 . It is the only act of the legislature , from which that court derives any power whatever on this subject ; and the question concerning its jurisdiction , if now open to discussion , must depend upon a fair construction of the provisions of this act . The act , however , 451 does not in terms enact the powers which it confers , but refers for an accurate description and definition of them to the 19th act of parliament 1633 , the 23d and 30th acts of the parliament 1690 , and the 24th act of the parliament 1693—The question concerning the powers of the court as defined by these acts , has been considered at the bar in two different points of view.—First , it has been contended by the appellant , that after a church was once modified and augmented , provided the stipend assigned was not below the minimum as fixed by law , the court could not re-augment , without encroaching on the sacred rights of property . On the other hand , by the respondent , it has been argued , that the clergy , from the reformation downwards , never gave up their claim to an adequate maintenance out of the tithe , and that the court , without any invasion of the right of property , had a right to assign such maintenance , and occasionally to augment it , as the circumstances of the times authorized.—Secondly , it has been stated on the part of the appellant , that the act 1707 , and the acts it referred to , in their enactments , only meant to confer the right of granting one augmentation of stipend , which was to endure in perpetuity , and that many concomitant circumstances clearly pointed out this to be the true construction of the law . On the other hand , this construction has been contested by the respondent , and arguments have been brought from other acts of parliament to induce your ldps to conclude , that the act 1633 , on which this question mainly relies , never intended to circumscribe the powers of the commission it appointed to the granting of a single augmentation , but that it clearly conferred the right of reviewing its own decisions.—In the conduct of the argument , much learning has been displayed , on the appropriation of the tithe in ancient times in Scotland . The act 1567 , which granted a third of all benefices to the church , and the circumstances that the various grants of tithes to the lords of erection , were uniformly burdened with the condition of maintaining the clergy , had been relied on as proofs that the clergy , at no time , even after the reformation , were deprived of that
