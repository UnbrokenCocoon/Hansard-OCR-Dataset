of directors . When Hyder Ally invaded the Carnatic in 1780 , there was an instant stop to all payments from the nabob.—In that dreadful exigency , so eloquently de- 384 scribed by Mr. Burke in the speech to which the hon . member had before alluded , the assignment of the revenues of the Carnatic was obtained , without which all our revenues and credit must have been inevitably sunk to no purpose . Of the importance of that assignment , and of the danger of restoring the Carnatic to the nabob , lord Macartney was so deeply impressed that , in one of his letters to the court of directors , he says , From the moment you surrender the assignment , you cease to be a nation on the coast ; and in another , Without the assignment , I see not a ray of hope for the preservation of the Company or the security of the nabob.—Lord Macartney justly considered the assignment to be , not only the rock of our strength in the Carnatic , but that the nabob 's real interest and happiness , as well as the general security would have been best consulted by retaining it ; and that the Company , upon the same principle that they exercised the right to wield the sword for the common good in time of war , ought to have administered the revenues for the common good in time of peace . Lord Cornwallis perfectly coincided in opinion with lord Macartney as to the necessity of a radical reform , and he examined the whole system of our connection with the nabob , with a view to that object . The opinion of lord Cornwallis must have so much weight with the house and with the country at large , that the hon . member was anxious to draw their attention to an extract of a letter from his lordship to the court of directors in Aug. 1790 , I must freely own says lord Cornwallis , that I could not venture to propose any plan , on the success of which I could have any firm reliance , unless the nabob could be induced by a large annual revenue , regularly paid avid properly secured to him , to surrender the management of his country for a long term of years , to the company . The nabob 's age , his long connection with us , his right to the possession of the country which , however , without our assistance , would have been but of little value to him , and exaggerated accounts of former services , may furnish topics for popular declamation , and may possibly engage the nation , upon mistaken ideas of humanity , to support a system of cruelty and oppression ; but whilst I feel conscious that I am endeavouring to promote the happiness of mankind , and the good of my country , I shall give very little weight to such considerations , 385 and I should conceive that I had not performed the duty of the high office in which you did me the honour to place me , if I did not declare that the present mixed government can not prosper in the best hands in which your part of it can be placed , and that unless some such plan as that which I have proposed should be adopted , the inhabitants of the Carnatic must continue to be wretched , the nabob must remain an indigent bankrupt , and his country an useless and expensive burthen to the company and the nation . This was not the only proof that this subject had engaged the most serious attention of lord Cornwallis , for in a letter written two years afterwards , his lordship observed that , If there had been the least chance of obtaining the nabob 's acquiescence he should without hesitation have been ready to have proposed to him as the plan best calculated for promoting his own interest and comfort , and the happiness of the inhabitants of the Carnatic , that he should entrust the company with
