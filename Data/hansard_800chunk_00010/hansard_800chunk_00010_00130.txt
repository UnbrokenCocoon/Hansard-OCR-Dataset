branch of our constitutional polity , a sentiment which is so eminently necessary to the preservation of our pure religion , as in church and state established ; and it has not been without 258 the most deep-felt sorrow that they have witnessed the unsubstantiated charges and invectives industriously disseminated and indiscriminately brought forward against the clergy of England , as a negligent and mercenary body , at a time too when their proved zeal and acknowledged efforts , during periods of unexampled danger , which menaced the security not only of the throne and altar , but through them the conservation of property and of the principles of moral order , ought , they have a right to hope , to have been justly appreciated , if not gratefully remembered by their country ; and that in these times of unexampled pressure upon the moderately beneficed clergy , they can not but consider as impolitic , unnecessary , and vexatious , any farther privations tending to destroy the almost solely remaining link which connects the higher with the lower orders of the people , a link which by communicating the wants of the latter to the notice of the former , keeps up an intercourse of benefits and gratitude between both ; that the consequent depression of the moderately beneficed clergy , on the contrary , must approximate them too much to the poor to command their respect , and remove them at too great a distance from the rich to obtain their regard and due consideration ; and that they conceive the unbeneficed clergy have every reason to be satisfied with the liberal allowance at present in the power of the bishops to assign them , inasmuch as they frequently enjoy resources from which incumbents in general are debarred , such as fellowships , lectureships , chaplaincies , and tuition in all its branches ; and indeed they conceive the bill essentially defective in not marking the appropriate difference which obviously distinguishes payment from reward ; and that in many instances it will be liable to the objection of giving more , in proportion to the duties performed , than is consistent with strict justice , as it will be found that in general the most valuable benefices are those which enjoy the greatest exemption from arduous duty , and indiscriminate charges of extravagant and disproportioned emoluments may apply to payments , but not to the nature of rewards , regulated by the distinction of age , learning , and dignity ; and that this bill , they apprehend , strikes at the very essence of all property , permanent or usufructuary , which it is the fundamental principle and established practice of our constitution to preserve inviolate ; and 259 as the clergy hold their possessions , they are willing to hope , by as good a title as any other order in the state , if authorized resumptions begin with them , they can not but suggest the alarming consequences which naturally force themselves upon the imagination ; they beg leave also to point out to the house the infinite and much to be deprecated mischiefs which must ensue to them as a body , and to the unbeneficed clergy themselves , from those jealousies and animosities which may unhappily arise between the incumbent and his curate , a circumstance which can not at all contribute to the practical harmony and edification of the parish , by rendering in many cases the curacy more desirable than the living , and by conferring that independency on the curate which will destroy the natural order of things , and create an inversion unprecedented in every other situation in life , of a deputy being placed above his employer , totally uninfluenced and uncontrouled by him ; and that among the numerous evils with which in their estimation the bill is pregnant , the facility it promises to the diffusion of Sectarian principles is not the least alarming ; the indignity to which the bill subjects the regular clergy , in authorising the complaints of the church-wardens to the bishops , may unhappily open a door to interested or
