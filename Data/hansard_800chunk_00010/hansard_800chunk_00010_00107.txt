the county of Cambridge , against the proposed measure of exclusive Distillation from Sugar . He hoped that the chairman and members of the West India committee , who had recommended that measure , would not bring forward the motion on Monday , but that they would give time for the satisfactory examination of the voluminous documents that accompanied the report . The importance of the measure required mature deliberation , and he was sure the committee could not wish to hurry it through the house . had certainly no wish for improper haste , but no delay could take place consistently with any prospect of carrying the measure into effect this year . After a few words from sir J. Newport , the Speaker put a stop to the conversation as irregular , and lord Binning being again appealed to , declared , that for the reasons already stated by him , he must persist in bringing forward his motion on Monday , gave his consent to the motion , on the ground , that a Committee would afford the most satisfactory mode , according to the opinion of the honourable mover , for discussing the merits of the case : he begged , however , to be understood as by no means , from his acquiescence in this step , giving his concurrence to the measure , or assenting , in any degree , to the principle of opening anew an arrangement long closed.—The house having gone into a Committee , rose and spoke as follows : —Sir ; Before I state the grounds of the motion I mean to submit to the consideration of the house , I beg leave to say a few-words in explanation of the reason which has induced me to come forward on this occasion . I trust I shall stand acquitted of any impropriety in being the advocate of what may be considered , in some degree , my own cause . I am fully aware of the difficulty and delicacy of my situation , and how much I stand in need of the patience and kind consideration of those whom I have the honour to address , to enable me to execute what I have felt my duty to undertake . The difficulty I speak of consists solely in that apprehension which I conceive must be natural to any one , like myself , unaccustomed to address this house , and which I think may have occurred even to those whose abilities justified a confidence in themselves , which I only derive from a conviction that , in the present instance , no talents on my part can be requisite.—I beg to assure the house , that whatever my own feelings maybe , I have not a wish to excite an interest with them beyond that of honouring me with their attention , and doing that impartial justice in this case to which , if their own , they might conceive themselves entitled ; and that I have no motive in personally bringing it forward , but to conduct any discussion that may be necessary on the part of the Petitioner in such a manner , as to shew how much he wishes to avoid the slightest personal disrespect to those with whom it may have been his misfortune to have differed on this subject , and those of whose liberality in leaving it to the unbiassed decision of the only court to 162 which he can appeal , no one will be more sensible than himself.—Sir ; I mean , as shortly as possible , to occupy the attention of the house ; and to this effect , shall merely move to read the Report of the Committee , and follow it with a motion conformably to the observations therein contained . Should such motion meet the approbation of the house , it will be unnecessary for me to give it further trouble ; but in the event of a difference of opinion , I humbly beg leave to express my wish , that I may be allowed to take an early opportunity of answering the objections which may occur
