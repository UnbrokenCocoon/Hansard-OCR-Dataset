and the prosperity of the country , might prescribe.—The principle of humanity , and consideration for the family of Arcot , which dictated the offer to Ally Hussein , presided also over the disposition that was finally made , and limited it to the necessary objects that were to be attained and secured . What but this , and the recollection of our alliance with the nabobs of the Carnatic , subsisting almost from the first dawn of our political power in the peninsula ? What but the reluctance to expose to disgrace and humiliation those whom we had adopted as the partners of our fortune , and raised to sovereign dominion ? What but the generosity characteristic of the British nation , could have led us to forget that from the nabobs we had experienced little but faithlessness and ingratitude , and the people committed to their rule , nothing but misery and oppression ? What but these sentiments could have stifled our just resentments , under the accumulated injuries we had sustained , and produced the efforts that were made by our government , to obtain by friendly negociation , what as a right it might have at once confidently assumed ? What but these , to continue to their families as we have done , the enjoyment of all the affluence , dignity , and splendour , which belonged to their station , and to which they had ever been accustomed ? —On the next point , relating to the manner in which our rights were exercised , and the duty of exercising 359 them to the extent we did . I am happy to think that little doubt can be entertained ; indeed , I shall be surprised if , in any part of this discussion , it should be contended , or at least contended by one acquainted with the state of the Carnatic , that any thing short of the transfer of the whole civil and military administration of the country to the British government , was capable of providing effectually for the rights we were bound to maintain , and for the prosperity of the long oppressed inhabitants of a country which it now became equally our duty to watch over and protect . Though I do not admit the state of the Carnatic , deplorable as it might be , could form any ground on which to found a right to adopt the measure that has been resorted to , yet it can scarcely be denied , that when the circumstances of hostility and perfidy before stated , did place the whole country at our disposal , we became responsible for the effects of whatever dispositions we should make , and for the happiness of the people , no less than for our own security : from that moment on our heads must naturally rest the odium of every abuse , injustice , and oppression chat was suffered to prevail , and it was in our power to avert . And was there even a possibility of averting them otherwise than by the complete transfer of the administration ? Did not the state of things , and long experience alike demonstrate that every hope of obviating the recurrence of the numberless evils with which the Carnatic was afflicted , founded on any other basis , was but visionary and delusive.—There are many gentlemen in the house who from local knowledge and personal observation , are much better able to detail to you , than I can be , the state and condition of that unhappy country . The documents themselves contain abundant and melancholy proofs of the sufferings of its inhabitants , under the operation of assignments made to those who , having no interest or object , but to repay to themselves with usury the money they had advanced , let loose every species of cruelty and extortion in accomplishing it . Nor less under the immediate managers appointed by the nabob , who seem to have been commissioned only to exhaust and ruin the provinces committed to their charge , and to whose uncontrolled rapacity , the insatiable wants of
