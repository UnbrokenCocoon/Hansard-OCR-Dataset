prince afterwards sunk under the 327 which has in every war in which , we have been engaged , embarrassed the progress of united arms of the French and the soubah of the Deccan , and fell at the battle of Amboor , where his eldest son was at the same time made a prisoner ; while his second son , Mahommed Ally ( known subsequently by the name of Wallajah ) fled , stript of every thing , to the fortress of Trichinopoly ; a new nabob was immediately appointed by the victorious party , and the fortunes of the house of Anwar-ud-deen seemed to be for ever extinguished . In vain did Mahommed Ally proclaim his pretended title to the succession ; in vain implore the friendship of the French , by whom his rival was avowedly supported . His last resource was to solicit the protection of the British government . Fortunately for him our situation at the moment , and the necessity of preserving our own existence in the peninsula , forced upon us that of resisting the increasing power and ambitious projects of France . We extended to him therefore the protection he solicited ; and how we performed our part need not now be told . After an arduous and glorious contest , success crowned the British arms , and the consequence of that success placed Mahommed Ally on the musnud . Having thus raised him from the dust , and , in an evil hour , given him the possession of a great and flourishing kingdom , having procured the recognition of his title both in India and in Europe , it is not easy to conceive what services he could render that were more than adequate to those he had received—less than fidelity and attachment to the power which had retrieved the fortunes , and revived the splendour and power of his house ; less than a fair participation in the resources of the country , gained by our arms , to the extent which might be necessary to maintain the common interest of its defence , we could not , in justice to ourselves , demand , and more we did not claim.—This , sir , is the language of all the treaties concluded with this prince , and these the conditions of all his claims to the support which he invariably experienced from the British power.—It is not my intention to enter into any details relative to what has passed during the connexion which has so long subsisted ; or to give you a history of the intrigues , the corruptions , the impatience of our power , the struggles for independence , and the unprincipled ambition , which have been exhibited on the part of the nabob ; neither do I mean to detail the instances of his faithlessness to all his engagements , 328 which has in every war in which we have been engaged , embarrassed the progress of our arms , and more than once brought our affairs to the very verge of ruin ; but I shall come at once to what bears more directly upon the subject of our discussion ; I mean the treaty concluded by sir Archibald Campbell in the year 1787.—That treaty was in part pecuniary , and in part political ; it provided an annual sum for the discharge of the nabob 's debts , and for a large military subsidy , for which it appointed a landed security ; and it precluded him from entering into any political negociations or controversies with any state or power , without the consent or approbation of the president in council of Fort St. George.—The alledged distresses of the nabob , and the difficulties he professed to feel in fulfilling his pecuniary engagements , induced lord Cornwallis to consent to a revision of this treaty ; and in consequence of that revision a new treaty was concluded in 1792 , between the British government in India and Mahommed Ally , known by the name of lord Cornwallis 's treaty . By this engagement the nabob was relieved from a large proportion of the
