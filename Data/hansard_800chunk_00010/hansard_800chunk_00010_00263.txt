by fire . ' He answered , `` That they had , '' —clearly implying , that in his opinion a proof that stipends had been before modified under any commissions , was a defence from an augmentation claimed from the court of session , acting under the act 1707.—To the same purport is the evidence of Mr. Chalmer , father of an eminent solicitor who practises at your ldps bar , who seems to have possessed all the accuracy and assiduity that distinguishes his son : he says , 'That he had examined the records of all the decreets of the court of session , since the union to the year 1738 , relating to the augmentation of ministers ' stipends ; and that he does not know any instance , or find any one upon record , wherein the court of session have augmented any living within that period which had before obtained a decreet of modification . '—These expressions , it is apparent , are perfectly general , applying to a decreet of modification under any former commission , and not confining themselves to an augmentation granted by the court of session since the union.—The same doctrine is asserted in the petition of the landholders to the house of commons , which is signed by president Dundas , and some other eminent lawyers.—Indeed , I may on this subject rely on the authority of the clergy themselves , for in the answer to the third and fourth reasons of dissent of the landholders , drawn up by the committee of the general assembly 1749 , there is to be found the following passage , which strongly marks a coincidence of opinion on their part : —'One thing , however , we can not omit to observe , that though by several acts of parliament , the clergy have right to an . augmentation , the lords have held it as a rule , to augment no stipend modified and localled since the union although many cases occur in which such augmentation ought to have been granted . '—It is to be observed , that the meaning of this passage must depend entirely on the punctuation . It may mean that the lords have since the union held it as a rule 463 to augment no stipend , antecedently modified and localled ; or that the lords have held it a rule to augment no stipend , where the decreet of modification has passed since the union ; but the history of the times , as admitted by the respondents in this case , clearly shews that it must have the former meaning . It is here stated , that many cases occur in which such augmentations ought to have been granted , which is perfectly consistent with the former interpretation of the sentence , but quite inconsistent with the latter ; as the respondents admit that there was no case in which two augmentations of the same living had been granted since the union , previous to the year 1749 , except , the case of Kettle in the year 1742 , and the word 'many ' never could have been applied to the single , case of Kettle ; which case turns out , on examination , to have been erroneously referred to , as it was a decreet of locality , and not a second augmentation that was given in the year 1742 . Thus the clergy themselves must be understood in the year 1749 , to have sanctioned the interpretation of the law here contended for.—It certainly , however , appears to me , that even at this period there was some loose idea of a rule existing , that the court of teinds might grant one augmentation in every parish , and that they then considered themselves as functi officio with regard to that parish . But at what time this rule was first acted upon , how or by what authority it was introduced , has been explained by neither party at the bar.—On the nature of the rule , the parties seem to me to be by no means agreed .
