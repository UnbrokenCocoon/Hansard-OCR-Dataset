and our allies : with this , the intelligence conveyed , and the advice that accompanied it : with this , the assignations under feigned pretences , and the solemn adjuration to secrecy : with this is consistent the prayers of Wallajah for the triumphs of Tippoo , and with this the assurances of his son and successor , that when the occasion should arrive , his fidelity to him should be manifested ; and , with this is consistent all the subsequent conduct of Omdut ul Omrah ; when , in the course of the Mysore war , in his contemplation , the anticipated occasion did arrive ; when the exigencies of our situation , when the success of the contest , and the safety of our empire , demanded every exertion , and every proof of his zeal and attachment . At that moment of pressure did he withhold his resources—at that moment did his officers impede the supplies 350 of the army , in some cases resorting even to force to obstruct their passage , and at that moment did they create every embarrassment and oppose every obstacle within the extent of their power , to the progress of our arms . In short , sir , such was the conduct we experienced from , this faithful and devoted friend , that during the existence of hostilities , and long previous to the discovery at Seringapatam , the governor-general , as it appears , not only entertained suspicion , but repeatedly and pointedly declared that the perverseness and disaffection displayed by the nabob , was reconcileable to nothing but a connection , or secret understanding , with the enemy.—It has been asked what interest the nabob could have in such a conduct ? I do not feel , sir , that to infer the reality of the conduct I am obliged to assign to it an object of sound and rational policy . It is too much to presume , after all that the times in which we live have exhibited , that projects may not be formed , and designs pursued , that are not warranted by a true and enlightened wisdom . But if the policy of the nabob was not to aid the efforts of the sultaun ; if , on the contrary , we admit what is stated , that he had little to hope , every thing to fear from their success , it must follow , that it was his real interest , faithfully to adhere to our cause , and to contribute , to the utmost of his means , in promoting and facilitating the triumph of our arms . That he did the very reverse , is incontestibly proved ; and , if in so acting , swayed by any imaginary interest , he trampled on every principle of true policy and duty , by which he ought to have been governed , may we not presume that , swayed also by the same supposed interest , he may equally have carried on a correspondence , and formed a connection , at once hostile to his real welfare , to the faith of his engagements , and to the cause he was bound by every tie to make his own.—What beyond a general and mutual aid , as occasions might offer , were the precise expectations of Tippoo on the one hand , and of the nabob on the other , I will not detain you by an attempt to explain ; on that the question does not turn , and I venture to call , with some degree of confidence , upon the house , to consider well the case laid before them , and after adverting to the relative situations of Tippoo Sultaun , and the nabobs of the Carnatic , one actually preparing war against us , the other our most intimate ally ; looking at the 351 correspondence itself , confirmed as it is by the oral testimony , in all its facts , with all the precautions for concealment that pervades and characterizes it ; recollecting the solemn pledge of the nabob Omdut ul
