it will have the effect of elevating the general character of the nation , by calling the general mass of the community into a new sphere of action , calculated to make them feel their importance and independence.—That trial by jury in civil causes , and in misdemeanours , has had most important effects on the English character ; that it has fostered that just anxiety which prevails in the minds of Englishmen , respecting their political as well as their civil liberty , can not be doubted ; and there is every reason to suppose , that it would produce a similar effect on the people of Scotland . I can not , therefore , avoid deprecating the tame , insipid , spiritless , and discouraging language which is applied to this most admirable institution in the bill before us . An institution which the experience of ages , in this country , has proved to be the most satisfactory and expeditious mode for trying all these questions , which do 1071 not belong peculiarly to a court of equity , and more particularly adapted to questions , arising from increased commerce , population and agriculture , which the preamble to this bill assigns as the cause of the increased number of law-suits brought into the Court of Session.—Sir , it is impossible not to observe , that the commissioners under this bill , are to be appointed by the selection of the ministers of the crown , and not by the choice of the legislature . To this mode of appointment , at an earlier stage of the proceeding , ( if I had been able to be present ) , I would have given a most decided opposition , as a mode equally unconstitutional and inexpedient . But I forbear to enlarge upon it now , because , in the situation in which the house now is , it can be attended with no practical effect to press it , and it might be attended with the loss of the bill , which is by no means my object , for the reasons already stated . My object , in this stage , is rather to discuss the subjects which the commissioners are to consider , than to enter into the question of their appointment , however objectionable.—Sir , there are many points for discussion , arising out of this measure : but , in the present state of the house , at this period of the session , and in the state of my health , I shall select those which appear to me to be most important.—The house will observe , in the third page of the printed bill , that it is proposed to be enacted , 'That it shall be competent to 'the judges of either division , or a quorum 'thereof , in any cases which shall appear 'to them to be cases of importance and 'difficulty , to state questions of law in 'writing arising on such cases , to require 'the opinion of the judges of the other division to be given thereupon ; and such 'judges are bound collectively , or as individual judges , to communicate their 'opinion to the court referring to them . —This regulation I consider to be both at variance with the principle of the bill itself , and a violation of those sound , well-known , and established rules , which ought , invariably , to prevail in every well regulated judicial system . I feel this so strongly , that I wish now to have it understood , that it is my present intention to propose , in the next session of parliament , to bring in a bill , on purpose to repeal this clause . —By the bill , there is ' a choice of tribunals established , and the judicial system of Scotland is thus most materially and importantly improved . Where a suit is in- 1072 stituted , the plaintiff or pursuer has it in his power to choose either the chamber of the president , or that of the justice-clerk . But , by this clause ,
