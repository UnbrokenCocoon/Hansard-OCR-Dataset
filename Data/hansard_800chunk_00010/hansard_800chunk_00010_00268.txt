who pleaded the cause in the house of lords , on the part of the heritors ( meaning the lord president ) , that it would require no fewer than three appeals , iu cases which stood in different circumstances from one another , to obtain a decision on the general point at issue , ' clearly shewing that the impression on his mind at that time , was accurate with regard to the decision of the house of lords ; i. e. that the decision was what the words in which it was conveyed prove it must have been , a judgment dictated by a consideration of the specialties of the case.—From these details , it must appear evident to your ldps , that the only decision ever given on the general point of law , concerning the competency of the court to reaugment , was the unanimous decision pronounced in the Tingwall case , by the court of session itself . It is impossible , therefore , that your ldps can affirm an interlocutor , which states you to have decided in two cases a point of law , on which certainly you never pronounced any decision.—If , therefore , I can not agree to the justice of 470 that view of the law , which lays down that the court , under the act 1707. had power to reaugment out of tithes sold by the titular to the landholder , till they were completely exhausted : on the other hand , it is impossible to accede to the fact stated in this interlocutor , that this house had recognised such an interpretation of the statute , by a judgment which it never gave.—In the course of the pleadings , your ldps have had various quotations from Forbes on Tithes ; from sir G. Mackenzie 's Observations on the Statute , from lord Bankton , and from the Institutes of Mr. Erskine . With respect to most of the passages which have been relied upon , when examined , they are mere affirmations of a proposition never contested , that the tithe of the landholder in all parishes not modified , is subject to such provision for the clergy , as the court acting as a commission shall appoint.—In Mr. Erskine 's works undoubtedly there is a passage , which can alone be considered as maintaining the opinion , which the interlocutor under review has expressed ; but , whatever weight may be due to the authority of any law-writer , when the statutes themselves are clear , and the meaning of their enactments unquestionable , it is impossible that any authority can be relied on , to do away that which the legislature has so distinctly declared , and which the court had confirmed by their judgments immediately after passing the act.—Your ldps have been told , that in this case you have the advantage of the opinions of the judges corrected by themselves ; I have had already occasion to mention the opinion delivered by lord Armadale , in the manner which I think it merits ; but I must conceive it to be an exercise of charity , not to animadvert on many of the opinions that have been printed . They are in truth defences urged by the judges for their own conduct , which they might have made , without reading the learned arguments in this cause , which have done credit and honour to those who framed them.—In some of the opinions , the learned judges have assumed the character of witnesses , and I am sorry to say that in that capacity their recollection of the facts appears to me as remarkable for inaccuracy , as their legal arguments are for want of research and investigation , on a subject which did demand their utmost attention.—There is now only one important point to consider : certain it is , that founding on this misconception and mis- 471 representation of the decisions of your ldps house , the court of session have now for a length of time , and in no fewer than 800 cases , augmented stipends , many of
