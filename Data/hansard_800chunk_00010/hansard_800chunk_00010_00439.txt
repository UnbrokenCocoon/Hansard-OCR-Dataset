money , in-as-much as contrary to all custom and precedent , those funds which have in part always been appropriated to reward the exertions of captors , were bestowed wholly upon sir Home Popham , who , being a lieutenant in his majesty 's navy , had been detected knowingly carrying on illicit trade in contempt of the laws of his country , contrary to his duty as a British subject , and to the disgrace of the character of a British officer ; operating at the same time as a discouragement to his majesty 's naval forces , by depriving them of the accustomed rewards of their zeal and activity ; and as an incitement to the contempt and disregard of the laws of the land , by bestowing reward and impunity on those who had been detected in the violation of them . '' —Before I reply to the various charges brought forward against me by the hon . gentleman , I trust that the house will indulge me with a patient hearing , while I offer a few preliminary observations , which are the more necessary to the vindication of my character , as they relate to circumstances immediately arising from the original question , or brought forward in this house since its , first discussion . I wish not to detain the house by frivolous and irrelevant platter , but to oppose facts to calumny , and to combat prejudices and falsehoods with no other weapons than truth and plain dealing . The persecution which has been exercised against me for several years past must be strong in the recollection of every member of this house ; but of all the exertions which have been 735 used on former occasions to traduce me , and to render me odious to the country , none have been equal to those exercised on the present occasion . No pains have been spared , no means scrupled at , to lower and vilify my character : the poisoned arrows of mine enemies have been aimed at me both as a public man and a private individual ; they have raked into every part of my life to find out some personal weakness , in order to use it as a calumny against me : the follies of my youth , and any attendant foibles , have been held out to the public as the most enormous crimes : all the private transactions of my life have , been gone into ; and such an effect has it had , that unless I yield in all cases to what I consider an imposition , a threat of impeachment is held out against me , and this by the house entertaining discussions on private transactions.—Having , sir , mentioned the unprecedented pains that have been taken to hunt me down , I can not help observing , that before another court of honour the accused , in the preamble of his defence , very highly complimented the editors of the newspapers for the strict silence they had observed from the moment of its being publicly known that the officer alluded to was to be tried ; whereas the instant the honourable gentleman opened his masked battery upon me , the literary assailants began in every way to take me in flank and rear , with a view of raising the whole country against me . Sir , I will take the liberty of reading one paragraph which accuses me of being a traitor to my country , and carrying gunpowder in the enemy , which is the highest crime in the mind of a British public , lam sorry that lowering me in the public esteem should be an object of such high importance , that such unworthy means are resorted to against me . I did think the liberal constitution of this country considered every person arraigned for an offence , as under the protection of the court before which he was arraigned ; and above all do I still think , that in my peculiar situation , I am under the protection of the dignity of this house .
