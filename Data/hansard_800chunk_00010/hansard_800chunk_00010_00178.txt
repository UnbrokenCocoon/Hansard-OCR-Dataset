to decide without prejudice , I entered upon the consideration of it . I know not what credit I may have with the hon . gent , when I declare the result of that consideration to have been , a conscientious conviction , that the charge against the nabobs was substantiated . I do not mean , that the evidence is such as the strict accuracy of a British court of justice might require ; but that there arises from it that degree of presumption , on which nations have universally acted , and on which nations must act if they have any regard for their safety . There is reason for caution undoubtedly , but caution ought not to degenerate into timidity ; and I own I should have little respect for that man , and think him little fitted for his situation , who , entrusted with the affairs of a great people , from apprehension of the clamour of the misrepresentation and injustice he might eventually experience , could consent to sacrifice one atom of the interests he was delegated to preserve—The evidence is of two kinds , partly to be found in the correspondence , and partly in the conduct of the nabob . The first part I shall consider is the correspondence.—After the fall of Seringapatam , it is known that all the papers of the sultaun fell into the hands of the British government . In these papers were discovered the various negoeiations in which he had been engaged with different powers , and amongst them , a correspondence implicating the nabobs Wallajah and Omdut ul Omrah , carried on through the vakeels , who attended the sons of Tippoo when hostages at Madras , for the performance of the conditions of peace in 1792.—Of the authenticity of these papers , the hon . baronet has not ventured to express much doubt . In fact , sir , they are so recognized by the evidence of the vakeels themselves , through whom the communications passed , that it is not necessary to rest on the circumstance of their transmission by the governor general , whose authority , in-dependant of that circumstance , I would not condescend to balance against the supposition of the khans , that it was possible they might have been introduced among Tippoo 's papers , by enemies of the nabob ; Omdut ul Omrah.—Assuming then their authenticity , they prove in the first instance , that a correspondence was carried on between Tippoo Sultaun and the nabobs of 331 the Carnatic , through a secret and un-avowed channel.—Fully am I aware of the spirit of intrigue prevailing among the princes of India ; and I admit , that a correspondence , which , in Europe , would infer a violation of every tie of honour and good faith , may not , in the native courts , be always liable to such an imputation : but , to that I must answer , that the British government was known to act on other principles ; that it was known to apprehend danger from such correspondence ; that it had anxiously precluded them in two successive treaties , and that the nabobs had every reason to be sufficiently conscious of the interpretation we should put upon , and the indignation we should feel , at the discovery of such clandestine intercourse.—The first observation , then , that presents itself is , that any correspondence between the parties in question , was at least a ground of grave suspicion . Next , that a correspondence carried on in defiance of the warnings arising out of the treaties , and with a certainty of the feelings that would be excited by the detection of it , could not be one of idle form or empty compliment ; that it must have had distinct objects , and objects of an interest commensurate ' to the risk incurred ; objects which demanded secrecy , and rendered the precautions resorted to , not superfluous ; that this correspondence must therefore have been of a nature , not less important in itself than inconsistent with the relations
