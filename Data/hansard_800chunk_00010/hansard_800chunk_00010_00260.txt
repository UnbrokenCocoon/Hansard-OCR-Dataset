landholder was to be subjected to an obligation after purchase , to pay the augmentation ; an obligation , which it is never alleged , existed in any conveyance from the titular to the landholder of tithe , subsequent to an augmentation having been granted.—There is another decision of the same day , in the case of Erskine against Ker , and the minister of Lecropt ; it is there found , that the titular is not obliged to augment the minister 's stipend if it was augmented by the last commission , by agreement betwixt the titular and the minister , provided it proceeded by way 458 of reference from the lords commissioners , to any of their number to sanction the agreement with the parties : now it is clear that nothing can bear more strictly on the point than this decision . In truth , it shews that the commission under the act 1041 could not in their opinion re-augment a living , even supposing it was proved that collusion had taken place between the parties , provided the commissioners acting under the former commission had sanctioned the result of that collusive agreement : how much more strongly , therefore , must they have felt themselves obliged to reject a claim where a decision had been pronounced by the commission after due and full examination of the case r—There is also a report of a decision of Feb. 22 , 1643 , which goes to confirm the same interpretation : in the case of Forgandenny it is found , 'that the kirks provided by the former commission , if they be bishop 's kirks , and provided within 800 merks , or eight chalders of victual , that by the act of parliament they have power to provide them further'—clearly shewing that the sense of the court was , that no addition could be made to the stipend of a kirk , if it were not a bishop 's kirk , and if it had not less than 800 merks , or otherwise fell under some one or other of the exceptions of the act 1641.—That the legislature meant , by the act 1633 , to give to the landholder a clear right , at the rate of nine years purchase , to the full possession of the tithe conveyed after a provision given for the clergyman , to be enjoyed by him in the same manner as if his property had been held 'cum decimis inclusis , ' does not even rest upon all this body of evidence , which I have taken the liberty to detail : a strong corroboration is derived from the act of the year 1090 , chap , xxiii . This act conveys to the patron of the parish all the parsonage tithes not heretably disponed , which it subjects generally , not only to past but future augmentation of stipend : it obliges the patron , as the act 1633 had obliged the titular , to sell the parsonage tithes thus acquired to the landholder : —but they were to be conveyed under the obligation on which they were held ; i. e. subject to future augmentations . Had they been conveyed , released from all such burden , the fair price must have much exceeded nine years purchase as fixed in 1033 . The interest of money had been reduced by an act of the legislature to six per cent . in 1661 . It was reduced in 459 queen Anne 's time to five . The value of a quit-rent in the year 1690 , therefore , must have greatly exceeded nine years purchase , but in consideration that those tithes were to be subjected to future augmentations , the act fixes their value at six years purchase , which on principle , as the market rate of interest of money was then at five , and in 1633 , at ten , must have induced the legislature in 1633 , if the tithe had been to have been conveyed to the landholder subject to the same burden , to have fixed the value at three years purchase
