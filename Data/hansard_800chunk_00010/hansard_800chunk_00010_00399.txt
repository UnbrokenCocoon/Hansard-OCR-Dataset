to his privy council that 'he should make it his endeavour to preserve the go- 669 vernment both in church and state , as by law established ; ' * a declaration soon afterwards repeated in his first speech from the throne ; but the disregard of which through the instigation of his religious confessor , cost him his crown . That it behoved those , who favoured this Proposition to consider what use had heretofore been made by Roman Catholics of political power ; and particularly to reflect on the manner in which it was exercised in the reign of queen Mary , and by James 2d , and his parliament in Ireland : — That it was the height of absurdity to suppose that this concession ( which could not fail , notwithstanding all that had been said by the noble baron to the contrary , to spread terror amongst the Protestants of Ireland ) could possibly have the effect of conciliating , and satisfying the Catholics : that for the great body of persons of that persuasion , and particularly for the priests , it would do nothing : it was therefore in vain to expect a contented acquiescence in a measure , founded upon an invidious preference of the higher classes of the laity , and which , by totally neglecting , excluded the clergy from the enjoyment of those emoluments , honors , and dignities , which were deemed to belong , as of right , to what is termed Holy Church , and to be fit and necessary instruments of its influence and power.—These were some of the objections which he felt to the proposition of the noble baron , the practical object of which was to obtain a repeal of the Test and Corporation acts , and to dispense with the Oath of Supremacy , for the purpose of enabling all persons of all sects and religions whatever to fill the highest offices of trust in the united kingdom . All distinctions on account of religion were to be done away : a Catholic was to become capable of keeping the conscience of the king , and of dispensing the preferments of a Protestant Church . But it was in vain to enter into a detail of all the mischief , and absurdities , to which , as it appeared to him , this innovation would necessarily lead . His objection was to the principle of getting rid of all distinctions on account of religion ; which objection was strengthened in the present instance by the tenets of the Church of Home , as detailed in her Canons , all of which were in force , until repealed by the * See Cobbett 's Parliamentary History of England , vol . iv , p. 1342 . 670 authority of a general council ; and still further , by the proofs with which history abounded , that the doctrines and discipline of that Church were hostile to the progress of knowledge , and to the civil and religious liberties of mankind . To him , therefore , it was a subject of astonishment that such an alteration should be countenanced by those who were friendly to the principles of the Revolution ; an event , produced , not by feelings of aversion to the Stuart family , but by a dread of arbitrary power , and of a religious communion , which had ever been its handmaid and instrument ; and it was not true that the danger was removed because the house of Stuart was extinct : on the contrary , the necessity of precaution continued because the tenets and discipline of the Church of Rome were unchanged.—It appeared therefore to him to be indispensably necessary to adhere firmly to the fundamental principles of the Reformation and Revolution : principles that were not violated , although their application was in some respects suspended , by measures of severity which were adopted under the pressure of a cruel , but , as lord Clare truly stated , an overruling and indispensable necessity , and which during the reign of his present majesty had been
