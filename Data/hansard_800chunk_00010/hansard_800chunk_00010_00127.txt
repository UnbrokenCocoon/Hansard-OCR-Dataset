He had some doubt as to how far it might tend to weaken the security of the creditor , but he thought it an experiment worth trying.â€”The bill was then read a second time . presented a petition from the gentlemen , clergy , merchants , and other inhabitants of Liverpool ; setting forth , `` That the said town essentially depends for the supply of bread to its numerous inhabitants , and a large and populous district in the interior of the county of Lancaster , upon importations of corn and flour from other parts , and that a large proportion of such supply has heretofore been derived from foreign countries ; and that , of late , in consequence of the unhappy situation of the continent of Europe , and the embargo which has taken place in the U . States of America , the importation of foreign corn and flour has ceased , and the prices of these articles have advanced considerably , and are still advancing , while , at the same time , from the stagnation of trade , and the consequent want of employment , and depreciation of wages , the labouring classes of the people are become less able to purchase these necessaries of life at a high rate , or even more reasonable rates , as fully appears by the Report lately made of evidence taken before a committee of the house , ordered to be printed on the 12th of April last , on 254 the Petition of certain cotton manufacturers and journeymen cotton weavers living in the county of Lancaster ; and that , from the united operation of these circumstances , the petitioners have been , and continue apprehensive of much distress amongst the poor in that populous town and county ; and it was with peculiar satisfaction that they observed , in a late Report of a committee of the house , the recommendation of what the petitioners humbly deem a wise measure of precaution loudly called for by the existing situation of the country , namely , the suspension of the use of Grain in the Distilleries of this kingdom , and the restriction of them to the use of Sugar for a limited period ; and that , in proportion to the satisfaction of the petitioners in so well-timed a recommendation , is their regret in perceiving that meetings have been held , in some parts of the country , for the purpose of obtaining petitions to the house against the measure in question , as calculated to injure the farmers , and discourage agriculture ; and that the petitioners humbly contend that this measure can not produce those effects , as it appears , by the Report of the committee , that , on an average of the last five years , the importation of foreign corn into Great Britain has not been less than 770,000 quarters per ann. , which must , of course , have found a consumption , but which can no longer be imported , while the quantity of corn used in the Distilleries of the United Kingdom does not exceed 780,000 quarters ; and therefore the corn to be excluded from the Distilleries by the proposed measure , supposing it to extend to Ireland as well as Great Britain , will only supply the place of the quantity hitherto imported from foreign parts ; and that , in addition to the usual foreign supply ( of which a large proportion has been received at Liverpool ) , there has been imported into that place from Ireland , on an average of the last five years , 242,525 quarters of corn , flour , and oatmeal per annum ; that , during the period now past of the present year , this usual supply has been greatly diminished , and in place of
