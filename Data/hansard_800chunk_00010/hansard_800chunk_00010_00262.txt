agreed by both parties that the ; tythe out of which this augmentation is claimed is tythe conveyed from the titular , in consequence of a purchase by the landholder , from whom the appellant derives his title.—There is still one observation of some importance that arises out of the act 1707 , from the use there made of the phrase , `` to grant augmentations , '' —a term seemingly copied from the act 1690 , and which is not to be found in the act 1633 . It is the more necessary to take this into consideration , as it appears that the chief argument on which the justice clerk , and some of the other judges , rest their opinion , is derived from the use of this phrase . To understand the import of it in the various acts of parliament in which it is used , it is necessary to attend to the circumstances of the times in which this phrase was first introduced . It is first to be 461 found in the rescinded act 1641 , and I apprehend that the meaning which your ldps must annex to it , is apparent when you recollect the legislative arrangements for the maintenance of the clergy at the time this act passed.—The commission 1617 and 1621 had proceeded to modify stipends under enactments that made 50O merks the minimum that was to be allotted to clergymen for their sustenance . The commission 1633 had acted under an act of parliament which directed that 800 merks should be the lowest : if therefore the words of the act 1641 had authorized the commission only to appoint constant local stipends , without the addition of the Words , `` and grant augmentations , '' it would have precluded that commission from taking under consideration the case of those ministers who had obtained 500 merks under the commission 1617 and 1621 ; and who had now a right to require that their stipends should be increased to 800 merks , the stipulated minimum , under the formal agreement sanctioned by the act 1633.—The act 1641 , your ldps will recollect , was done away at the restoration ; and the act 1661 , which was passed at that time , contains the same powers to grant augmentations , obviously for the purpose of including the case of clergymen , whose stipends had been modified under the acts 1617 and 1621.—Such are the grounds on which I can not help forming a decided opinion , that the act 1707 gave to the court of session powers to provide an adequate stipend , and to augment the livings of those who were provided with stipends under 800 merks , by the commissions 1617 and 1621 , or to grant augmentations in parishes , where by collusion the stipends had been fixed at a sum under the minimum ; but no power whatever to review the decisions of former commissions , or their own decisions , where a stipend above the minimum had been provided.—On the subject of the practice of the court subsequent to the union , there has been produced no direct evidence , to shew that the court for a length of time did not proceed on the idea , that this was the nature of the power they enjoyed . On the contrary , there is strong reason to believe that this was the view of the law under which they acted.—President Craigie 's evidence certainly tends to establish this opinion : he was examined before the house of commons in the year 1751 , and there is in his evidence the following remarkable passage : —'And being further ex- 462 amined , he was asked , whether , since the union , the heritors in augmentation suits have not been frequently under difficulties in proving their defences ; that the teinds have been before valued , or the stipends before modified , by reasons that the records of the commissioners of Teinds , antecedent to the reign of Charles 2 , were lost by shipwreck , and those from that time to 1702 , were consumed
