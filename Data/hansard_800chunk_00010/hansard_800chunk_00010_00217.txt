violation of the treaty of 1792 , not only by granting assignments on the districts which were mortgaged to the company as the security for his subsidy ; but also by entering into a secret correspondence with Tippoo Sultaun , the implacable enemy of the British name in India ; the hon . member contended that we were justified in considering the treaty of 1792 as annihilated , and in adopting whatever measures we deemed necessary to secure our rights in the Carnatic . With this view it was the intention of the British government , to have made a communication to the nabob , Umdit ul Omrah , of the proofs which they had obtained , of his having carried on a secret correspondence with Tippoo Sultaun contrary to the stipulations of the treaty of 1792.—He had previously been apprised of his violation of that treaty by granting assignments on the mortgaged districts . Circumstances of expediency however interrupted this communication ; it was protracted by the nabob 's illness , and his death frustrated the wish of the British government to obtain from him satisfactory security for their rights in the Carnatic.—Released from the treaty of 1792 , which had been repeatedly violated by the nabob , with the recorded opinions of lord Macartney , 389 lord Cornwallis , lord Buckinghamshire , and lord Powis , that no divided power , however modified , could possibly avert the utter ruin of the Carnatic , the opinion of lord Wellesley was further strengthened in these sentiments by a letter from the secret committee approved by the board of controul , transmitted to him in June , 1799 . In this letter the secret committee observed , In the event of a war with Tippoo Sultaun , the respective countries of the nabob of Arcot and the rajah of Tanjore , will of course come under the company 's management , and they direct that they be not relinquished without special orders from us or the court of directors . Without entering into any detailed examination of the contents of this letter , he would be satisfied with merely begging the house to remark , that even upon a general principle of expediency , and without any knowledge of the secret correspondence found at Seringapatam , the government at home ordered lord Wellesley not to relinquish the Carnatic even upon the conclusion of a peace with Tippoo Sultaun . Therefore , he was clearly of opinion , that under all these circumstances , it was the duty of lord Wellesley to form such an arrangement for the future administration of the affairs of the Carnatic , as should result from a full consideration of the relative situation of the nabob and the East India company ; the ruinous consequences of the repeated violations of the treaty of 1792 ; the interests of the inhabitants of the country , the security of the British government , and the orders that had been received from the court of directors.—A difficulty however arose with respect to the person who was to succeed to whatever degree of power it might be deemed safe to place in the hands of the successor of Umdit ul Omrah . His illegitimate and adopted son was considered entitled to a conditional preference , but when , under the suggestion of those , who had been the advisers of his father , he refused to accede to the terms which it had become necessary to annex to the situation of nabob of the Carnatic , the succession , subject to the stipulations required , was offered to and accepted by the next legitimate heir , the son of Ameer ul Omrah and grandson of Mahomed Ally . But it had been said , that that arrangement in the Carnatic was begun , continued and concluded with a rapidity which was observable in all the foreign transactions of the Bengal government ; it was no doubt 390 easy to make , but it certainly was as easy to refute such an assertion . So far from that rapidity with which the Bengal government was unjustly charged , it appears that
