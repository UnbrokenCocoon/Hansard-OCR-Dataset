of the King 's Proctor or Procurator-general were so numerous , that no one person was equal to discharge them ; the other , that an humble address be presented to his majesty , praying that he would appoint three or more persons to be employed as Proctors in the High Court of Admiralty and High Court of Appeal.—It would require little argument to satisfy any impartial mind with the necessity of these Resolutions , without meaning to cast the smallest cen- 871 sure on the character of the individual who held the office of Proctor , or those connected with him . On the contrary , he was ready to give them due credit for exerting themselves to their utmost ; but the business of that court was so increased since the establishment of one Proctor was deemed sufficient , that it was impossible it could be executed in a manner to do justice to the individuals in his majesty 's navy . Great delay , enormous charges , and injustice , must be the natural and is the actual consequence.—In the course of the last four years , more than 3,000 ships have been libelled by the King 's Proctor ; on an average each of those ships may be said to produce three distinct causes , which would increase them to 9,000 . Be it always remembered by the house , that the whole of what he was now stating , and about to state , is the special duty of the King 's Proctor , who is exclusively employed for the whole navy of England in all matters of prize , besides all cases in which the interest of his majesty is agitated ; in all appeals to the privy council , as well as in all memorials and reports : the number of appeal cases in the last four years have not been less than 500 , all of which are under his immediate direction ; on many of them very intricate and difficult questions arise ; the papers on the table of the house shew the number of ships libelled in the last four years by the King 's Proctor are above 3,000 ; there are other papers on the table which shew the amount of the Proctor 's bills on ships condemned as Droits . If gentlemen will take , the trouble to average those bills , they will find them to give an average of 95l . on each case ; but taking the average profit on the Proctor 's bills at less than a moiety of that sum , the 500 appeal cases , at an average of 100l . will produce a sum which , he was satisfied , the house would deem sufficient for at least three or four King 's Proctors : to the cases of ships libelled , and appeals to the privy council , must be added the numerous list of memorials and reports , which make a large portion of the profits of the office . But it was not the enormity of the sum that he so much objected to , it was the impossibility of justice being rendered to the British navy , by the system now persevered in , that induced him to offer his Resolutions ; and if he was not so fortunate as to succeed this day , he still flattered himself the period was not afar off , when his majesty 's government would see the necessity of re- 872 vising this court . He was aware he should be told , that vessels captured by men of war did not belong to the captors , but to the crown , therefore his resolution and address were an improper interference with the prerogative . Most sincerely should he regret such an objection to rendering justice to a most valuable portion of his majesty 's subjects . The delays and expences of the Admiralty Court , with the numerous evils and abuses which have occurred , were so well known to almost every individual connected with the navy , that he had not troubled the house with a long list
