to India without the consent of the East India Company , contrary to their exclusive charter ; that I had smuggled part of the cargo of the Etrusco into Ireland and England ; that I had absconded from India ; and had escaped from the ship in Ostend roads . If I was disposed , sir , to contend that the last letter from the admiralty was the only one which was binding on me , I might certainly do so , and in that letter it has been seen that no restriction whatever was imposed on me in regard to the Company 's settlements : it gave me unrestricted leave to go to India , and to reside two years at Fredericknagore , on the express condition 742 of my resigning my half pay : but I will not separate the inference which might be drawn from the first application , which was rejected , and in which application I stated I had no intention of going to the Company 's settlements with a view of remaining there . I will state the fact to the house exactly as it stood . When I sailed from Europe it was my intention to domicile myself at Serampour . I do not mean to say I should not have stopped at Calcutta on passing , but my fixed residence would certainly have been in the former place . In my voyage out , however , the ship struck on an unknown rock in the Mozambique channel : I was obliged to go to Bombay , and on my arrival there I found several English ships under foreign colours , commanded by Englishmen , and who had sailed from the port of Ostend in the same manner I had done . The treatment which these ships had experienced from the government of Bombay , certainly changed my view of the subject ; no restrictions were enforced on them , no law put in force against them , and the policy of encouraging this trade was an obvious feature in the general conduct of the government and the servants of the company . Under these circumstances was it not , sir , natural that I should avail myself of the same attention , and the same advantages , which were held out to others at the time it was supposed they were offending against a prohibitory law of the company ? From Bombay I went to Madras ; from Madras to Calcutta , though not in nay ship ; and on the moment of my arrival there , I was applied to by the governor-general to assist on a particular service ordered by the court of directors ; I in course acceded to the proposition ; and having now occasion to state that I was so employed by lord Cornwallis , I beg to disclaim the slightest intention of aspersing the character of that illustrious nobleman by any thing I could ever have said on the subject of his conduct towards me . All I meant to state was , that the governor-general knew I was a British subject , and that I was in the command of a foreign ship ; and although the hon . gent , has stated that the government of India had not the power of prosecuting the ship , yet he had the power of seizing me , as an individual , and sending me under an arrest to England ; a power , I believe , equally possessed by all the presidencies of India : but , on the contrary , the government not only abstained from noticing the trade in 743 which I had been engaged , but , conceiving I had performed some services to the Company by gratuitously applying my professional exertions in various instances , wrote in the strongest terms to the court of directors ; which letter , page 45 , I will take the liberty of reading , and by which it will be seen that the court of directors was particularly solicited to recommend me to the lords of the admiralty .
