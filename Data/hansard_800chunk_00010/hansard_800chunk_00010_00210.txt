of 10 lacks and 50 thousand pagodas . A treaty was in consequence concluded in 1787 , by which the nabob voluntarily agreed to pay nine lacks ; but , in less than eighteen months , he failed in his engagements , and his arrears , at the commence- 378 ment of the war , in 1790 , were so enormous as to oblige lord Cornwall is to assume , once more , the management of the country : certainly on the principles of justice , though not provided for by treaty . The assumption of the Carnatic in time of war , afterwards became an article in the treaty of 1792 , upon which occasion , the nabob having represented to lord Cornwallis the inadequacy of his resources to discharge his pecuniary engagements , an indulgent modification of the treaty of 1787 was framed . Had the treaty of 1792 been adhered to with that good faith , which we had a right to expect from the nabob , the country would have found in it a source of increasing prosperity ; for , by its wise provisions , a considerable portion of the Carnatic was exonerated from those private assignments , which had ever been productive of oppression and distress to the inhabitants ; but the expectations , justly entertained from the operation of that treaty , were disappointed , and the evils of the administration of the Carnatic , if possible , increased , after the death of Mahomed Ally in 1795 . It now became necessary , continued the hon . member , to examine whether the nabob adhered to the treaty of 1792 , and he thought he should have no difficulty in shewing that he had violated , not only the spirit , but the letter , of that treaty.—In the year 1794 , his noble friend , lord Buckinghamshire , assumed the government of Madras . It was notorious , at that time , that the nabob had granted assignments on the districts mortgaged to the Company.—In the minutes in council of his noble friend , the mischiefs resulting from that practice , were fully explained , and the system was traced through all its intricacies.—In a letter to the Court of Directors , dated in Sept. 1796 , lord Buckinghamshire observed , that the fullest consideration of this important subject , with the contemplation of that ruin in which the nabob 's breach of engagement is involving the Carnatic ; the daily accounts which he received of the oppression and miseries of the unfortunate inhabitants , and the conviction which he had of the progressive annihilation of the resources of the Company , had so strongly impressed his mind with the necessity of a change of system , that he had no hesitation in saying , if there be no doubt ( and it is not possible for any man in India to doubt it , ) of the treaty of 1792 having being violated by the nabob , there can be no 379 question of our right to avail ourselves of every means in our power to enforce such a modification of the treaty , as will guard against the fatal consequences of future violation , and he was not afraid to hazard his character upon the policy , the justice , and the humanity of the measure Mahomed Ally , the hon . member said , was apprized by his noble friend , that by the infraction of one of the main articles , the whole treaty had been cancelled , and lord Buckinghamshire endeavoured , but without success , to prevail upon the nabob to agree to a modification of the treaty , by placing under the Company 's management a permanent territorial security equal to the amount of the subsidy ; and , as an inducement , offered to give up a claim which the Company had on the nabob for about SO lacks of pagodas.—After the death of Mahomed Ally , lord Buckinghamshire made a similar proposal to the nabob Umdit ul Omrah , to which he likewise refused to accede . Umdit ul Omrah was also
