Indian government , which might not be 'equally appealed to , and insisted upon towards a prince who was exempted from all reliance on our friendship , either for his defence or security . All I ask , in return for this admission , is , that he may be considered in one only of these capacities , and that it may not be contended that he was at once entitled to the rights of a subject , and to the immunities of a sovereign.—It is superfluous to argue that the nabob Omdut ul Omrah was in conjunction with his father , a party to the treaty of 1792 , not merely as his future successor , recognized in that treaty , but individually in his own name and person . He was , therefore , from the period of its conclusion , bound to the observance of all its stipulations , and had , in the same degree with his father , conveyed to us what is called a perfect right to the benefits they conferred . If , therefore , the obligation contracted was not fulfilled in both according to its tenor , we acquired with respect to both , I apprehend , the right of enforcing it , if it was desirable it should be enforced ; of compelling reparation for 353 the violation of it , if reparation was deemed beneficial , or of avoiding the treaty altogether , if that should be most consistent with our views of expediency.—I trust , sir , I can not be so much misconceived as to be supposed to contend , that every little failure in fulfilling the strict letter of a treaty , is to be a ground for resorting to the exercise of these rights ; far from it . In my conception the infringement must be not of the letter only , but of the spirit and intent of the engagement , that too in points not trivial , but essential and important . Such are the points that present themselves in the grant of assignments , confessedly made , although expressly prohibited , which involved both the violation of the treaty , and the destruction of the resources on which we depended : and also in carrying on political correspondence with a foreign power , even destitute of any special aggravations . From infractions of this kind there is no doubt we should have derived a clear right to demand present reparation , and future security , and from the refusal of these demands , an unquestionable right of war would have accrued . Were it requisite , it would not , perhaps , be a difficult task to prove that , under all the circumstances of the case , what we have actually obtained in the Carnatic , does not exceed the bounds of this necessary security ; but this discussion would here be mere waste of time . I have adverted to it only to mark that even the accumulated injuries we suffered , have not carried us materially beyond what the infraction of the nabob 's engagements , without the aggravation , might have well warranted.—If it is not such infractions alone , but if in addition to such infractions of the subsisting treaty , there be shewn an association with a prince , not simply unfriendly in his character , and opposite in his interests , but in the actual preparation of war ; the object of which was our utter extirpation , if it be shewn that this association betrayed itself , not only while war was in contemplation , but continued and operated , during the whole course of the hostilities that ensued . No one , I apprehend , will contend , that from the instant such an association existed , the respective parties did not assume the position of enemies , and that all the rights which a state of war can convey , did not accrue to the injured power ; rights coextensive with the demands of permanent and effectual security , and limited only by the great principles of hu- 354 manity and justice.—The sudden
