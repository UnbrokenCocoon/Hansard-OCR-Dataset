of concealing what is supposed to require concealment . If we make this admission , ( and how is it to be refused ) if we believe the account given by Ally Reza Khan , which there is no reason to dispute , can we doubt that the correspondence of which this cypher was the intended instrument , in case of necessity at a future time , was felt to be of a nature to involve matters to which concealment was essential ? and to what correspondence such a concealment could be essential , except to one , repugnant to the existing engagements between the nabobs of the Carnatic and the British government , I own myself incapable of imagining , and must rely on those who support the resolutions to explain—Were the evidence drawn from written papers confined to this document , coupled with the details already adverted to , and combined with subsequent circumstances , I should think it far from inconsiderable . We have the proposition on the part of the nabob—the acceptance on the part of Tippoo , and in consequence of the harmony , as it is called , so established , a cypher manifestly calculated for correspondence on political subjects , and avowedly devised to carry on the purposes of such correspondence , whenever the present channel of communication between the parties should cease to be open . To have thus conveyed to Tippoo , under every precaution of secresy , the means of communication , means which anticipated all the chances of interruption with a providence and anxiety nothing but objects the most important could call forth , would , in itself , prove the eager solicitude in the nabob to maintain a connection with a prince , who , inexorably hostile towards the British power , not only habitually cherished , but , at the very instant , was meditating hostile projects against it . Had we no more than this , I say , it would warrant , not simply a suspicion of the most faithless designs , but would amount , if not to a literal infraction of the subsisting treaty , at least to a virtual violation of the vital spirit of it , and justify the adoption of measures for the protection of our rights and interests in the Carnatic , from the injury to which 337 they might be exposed by the infidelity or treachery of our ally.—About this period it appears that Ally Reza Khan made a journey to Seringapatam ; it is mentioned in the next letter , the principal object of it is explained by the evident as having been to impress with greater force upon the mind of the sultaun , the representations of lord Cornwallis , relative to the prisoners still detained , and the cruelty with which they were treated ; the allusions in it are said to apply to lord Cornwallis and Wallajah . On this letter I shall not detain you with any remark , beyond calling the attention of the house to the journey adverted to , and the period at which it took place . I proceed , then , to the two which follow . They are from Tippoo to the nabobs Wallajah and Omdut ul Omrah : they contain little more than professions of regard , and merit observation only on account of the application of some of the designations in the cypher , as the well-wisher of mankind to the nabob Wallajah , the distinguished in friendship to Ally Reza Khan . The second of these , however , from a supposed trivia mistake in the title of it , has been selected by the lion , baronet , and treated as a convicted fabrication . If , sir , there is one letter more than another , that bears internal evidence of its own authenticity it is this : for in the whole collection there is scarce one of so little importance . Had those who conducted the transaction , in question been capable of condescending to any forgery as the means of warranting it ; had they really introduced a fictitious letter
