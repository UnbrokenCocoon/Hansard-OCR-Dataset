. Upon the rumour of an internal commotion , or the approach of an invading army , they endeavoured to increase the general disorder instead of feeling an interest in quelling it . The Company have established in part , and propose to institute throughout the Carnatic , a fixed assessment of the landed revenue ; and regular judicial courts , where justice is administered by a person liberally rewarded , and whose honour and interest it is to decide impartially and diligently . This system protects with equal justice the persons and property of individuals against each other and against the government , and will soon substitute the blessings of good order for the miseries of tyranny and injustice . Upon the whole then , sir , I rejoice in the treaty made with Azeem ud Dowlah ; I see that it is justified by the law of nations , that it is in the highest degree beneficial to the Company , and above all , that it dispenses happiness to millions ; I shall therefore cordially vote against the hon . baronet 's motions , and in favour of the previous question and amendment , as proposed by the right hon . gent , who spoke second in the former debate . on his return into the house after this division , observed , that the numbers on his side were so few , that he . should not now proceed to move 798 his other two Resolutions , but would consent to postpone them , if the right hon . gent .

The Chancellor of the Exchequer and sir John Anstruther were perfectly indifferent when the hon . baronet should move them . What had passed in the debate of this night , and in the former debate , had completely shewn how unanswerable were the arguments which had been urged on their side ; and they were confident that when the public saw the state of the divisions , after so many boasts , and so many procrastinations , they would not fail to form a just opinion of die nature of the whole proceeding.â€”The other orders of the day were then disposed of , and the house adjourned , at three o'clock on Thursday morning . expressed himself altogether averse to the principle of this bill , and was extremely surprized to perceive it was endeavoured to be hurried through the house , when it made so great a grant of public money , and was a subject on which so many various and discordant sentiments had been already delivered . It 799 was a measure instituted without any necessity ; the crown had the power of granting pensions to superannuated Judges already ; and , least of all , did there exist , in the present instance , any shadow of reason for the interference of parliament .
