ears , he ought to be exterminated from the face of the earth ; or at least he should be banished for life to Botany Bay ; and even when arrived there he should be driven back into the sea ; —for there is no den of thieves , no gang of robbers , no banditti so thoroughly profligate , and at the same time so devoid of common understanding , as to admit that man a member of their community , upon whose fidelity to his engagements no reliance can be placed even for a single hour.—I come now to the second objection ; my answer to which will be 678 very short . Civil and military appointments , are it seems , matters of favour , not of right , and therefore the Catholics have no just cause to complain that they are excluded from them . I can hardly , my lords , conceive any man in earnest who regards this distinction as applicable to the present case , because no one pleads for an abstract right to these situations , but for a capacity of holding them : no one contends for the absolute possession of civil , and military offices , but for equal eligibility to them , and having endeavoured to prove , that all men are equally eligible , who give to the government under which they live , such a security , upon oath , for their conduct as subjects , as that government itself prescribes , and who maintain no opinions destructive of moral obligation or subversive of civil society , I shall only add here , that they are so considered to be , in almost all the governments of Europe and over the whole continent of America : and I should be sorry to see England the last to follow so good an example . 'But it is inexpedient , ' we are told , 'to repeal statutes , which 'were passed with much deliberation , and 'are considered by many as the bulwarks 'of the constitution in church and state . ' How long , my lords , it may be thought expedient , or necessary , that the remaining part of these restrictive disqualifying statutes should be enforced against the Catholics , or at what precise period their operation shall end , is a question not for a divine , but for statesmen and lawyers to decide . I may , however , be permitted to observe , that under any government , however free , though peculiar circumstances may perhaps call for statutes of a very strict , and even of a very severe nature , for a limited period of time , yet no wise statesman would , I imagine , wish those statutes to remain unrepealed , a moment after the circumstances which occasioned them cease to exist . Those who are acquainted with the history of the statutes here alluded to , and of the times in which they passed , will anticipate my application of this remark ; the application of it is , indeed , made for me , by a very eminent lawyer , and a very cordial friend to the Ecclesiastical , as well as to the Civil Constitution of this realm . This able writer observes , more than once , in his Commentaries , that whenever the period shall arrive , when the power of the Pope is weak and insignificant , and there is no Pretender to the throne , that then will be 679 'the time to grant full indulgence to the 'catholics . ' That time , my lords , is now come ; there is no Pretender to the throne ; and with respect to the Papal Power , not a single person present , apprehends , I am thoroughly persuaded , any danger from it ; —in truth that once gigantic , power—magni stat nominis umbra—and nothing more . Where , then , can be the objection to granting the Petition of the Catholics of Ireland ? A Petition founded on the immutable principles of reason and of justice ; a Petition
