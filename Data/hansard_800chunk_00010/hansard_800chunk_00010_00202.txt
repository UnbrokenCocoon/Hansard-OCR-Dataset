to admit the incontestable rights we were called 366 upon to realize—those rights were again and again explained to him ; the consequence of his resistance was again and again announced ; he again and again rejected the condition offered to him , and trusted to his fate . Enough was given to humanity ; enough to our own character and his inexperience , and the treaty was closed . It was not then to us , but to his voluntary adherence to the fallacious hopes and delusive confidence with which he had been insidiously inspired—to the pernicious impulse of that cabal which had betrayed his progenitors , and been the bane of his house , that he owed the change in his fortunes , and the disappointment of all his natural prospects . Under this fatal influence , he firmly pronounced his own sentence , and drove us reluctantly to the decisive measure of raising another prince to the musnud . It was possible , undoubtedly , that notwithstanding these circumstances , we might have still given to him possession of the throne : but would it have been wise , would it have been consistent with our tranquillity or safety ? He had refused our offers , rejected our favour , impeached our justice , and his whole efforts and resources would have been employed to subvert the order of things we had established . His means , perhaps , to affect us were not extensive or powerful , but his object and mind would have been certainly hostile , and we should have created , in the very heart of our empire , a counteracting influence—a centre of disaffection , around which all the dissatisfaction , intrigue , discontent , and turbulence of the country might gather and accumulate—where every hostile movement would find a promoter ; every enemy , foreign or domestic , Indian or European , a friend , an ally , and an instrument . This surely was sufficient to have dictated to us the prudence of consigning the sceptre , nominal and barren as it appeared , to safer and less doubtful hands.—It is with sincere regret I venture to recal to the recollection of the house an event so afflicting as the late mutiny at Vellore ; but , sir , nothing can more forcibly illustrate my argument . If a son of Tippoo Sultaun , a prisoner in that fortress , without power , without wealth , without means of seduction , could be supposed to produce such effects as by many are attributed to his intrigues and exertions , what might not have been those produced by the prince of the country with similar dispositions , and means infinitely more extended . I 367 will only add , though they would not , perhaps , have shaken the foundation of our empire , they might yet have given birth to such scenes of convulsion , horror , and bloodshed , as would have been long to be remembered and deplored.—It now remains for me to say a very few words ( very few , I assure the house , they shall be , ) on what I own is , in my estimation , a comparatively subordinate part of our consideration , I mean the circumstances that attended the execution of the measures in question . Indeed , sir , for the detail of them I am inclined to rest simply on the contents of the documents on tire table ; and I do so with the more readiness , because I feel I have already trespassed much too long on the patience of the house , and am certain whatever I shall omit , will be amply and more ably supplied by others , who are likely to take a share in this discussion.—The circumstances are stated in the report of the commissioners , and very differently in a letter , professing to be written by Ally Hussein , and addressed to his agents in England . On that letter , some reliance may probably be placed , by those who shall follow the honourable baronet in the debate
