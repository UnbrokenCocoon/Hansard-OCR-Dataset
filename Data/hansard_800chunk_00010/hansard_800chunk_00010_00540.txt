That right hon . gent. , too , had dispatched another expedition to Lisbon , the only force he had employed in Europe , and for the purpose of bringing away the Portuguese fleet . He could assure the right hon . gent. , that the present administration in the conduct they should adopt , would not follow his practical example , but act upon the result of their best and soundest judgment in adopting such measures as might , under all the circumstances of the case , be most conducive to the great and important ob- 897 ject which they had in view . As to what had been said respecting the extent of the assistance to be afforded , he was aware of the justice of what had fallen from the right hon . gent , who had brought forward the motion , and if the occasion should arise , he could assure that right hon . gent. , the country was in a situation to afford effectual assistance . When he considered the contrast between the patriotic sentiments of that right hon . gent , and the language of those around him , who were disposed to throw worse than cold water upon the hopes of the retrieval of Europe , he was sorry to see him sit amongst them , but he was confident that the country would do justice to that right hon . gentleman . regretted that the discussion had taken place , and was sorry for the manner in which the question had been discussed .

His object was to awaken the country to the opportunity which , if the information from Spain was true , might lead to the rescue of Europe , and to the release of oppressed countries from the grasp of a ruthless conqueror . He had , however , no objection to withdraw his motion , convinced that much benefit must 898 accrue even from the present discussion.â€” The motion was then withdrawn . opposed the measure in contemplation , as contrary to our established policy .
