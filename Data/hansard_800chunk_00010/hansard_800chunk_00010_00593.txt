1793 , and had nevertheless agreed that refusing to open it to them now would be a breach of public faith . How did he explain this ? Why , he asserted that the only possible ground upon which the parliament of 1793 could have omitted to open it , must have been the persuasion that it could not have been opened without a violation of the Bank charter then subsisting . Upon this point , with all due respect for the legal opinion of the noble and learned lord , he was inclined rather to bow to the legal opinion of the noble lord on the woolsack , who asserted that parliament might at that time , during the old charter , and might at any future time , during the prolongation of the charter , remove the restriction upon the admission of catholics , without any violation of the contract ; and he was confirmed in this opinion by recollecting what parliament had frequently done with respect to other charters , and particularly to the charter of the East India company . It being , then , far from clear that this opinion was the only ground upon which parliament had not given this privilege in 1793 , it remained at least as probable that it was not then given , because parliament did not then intend to give it ; and there was an end at once to the supposition of any breach of faith in refusing it now.â€”The noble lord then stated , that in the shape in which the question was brought before 981 their lordships by his noble friend ( lord Grenville ) , it was impossible to consider the proposal in any other light than as the grant of a privilege of which the catholics were not now possessed , and they were driven to discuss , upon that supposition , the expediency of granting it . Before he gave his reasons against granting it , he begged leave to state , that if it should turn out , upon a legal discussion , that it had been already granted , he should be as decidedly adverse to the revocation of it , as he was , under the present circumstances , to confer it . He wished not only that no privilege should be refused which the Catholics could , by any fair construction of the law , be now stated to possess , but that every act which had been passed in their favour should not merely stand as a dead letter on the statute-book , but should be executed in the spirit of liberality and concession which led to its enactment . He wished also that all those differences in manners and opinions , more powerful , and more nearly affecting the comfort of mankind , than laws themselves , might day by day be softened down , till they at length entirely vanished . Much must depend upon the conciliating conduct of the government , and of the protestant gentry of Ireland ; and he knew of nothing which appeared more clearly and obviously their duty than a strict adherence to this line of conduct , in every instance where it was compatible with justice to the protestant interest , whose uniform and distinguished loyalty ought neither to be abandoned nor discountenanced . More , however , must depend upon the conduct of the catholics themselves ; and it was well worthy of their consideration , how far a continual repetition of their claims , without any new ground of argument or expediency , and without giving time for the change of those opinions , or , if you please , allaying those prejudices , which were adverse to their claims , did not in fact pledge their opponents deeper and deeper at every discussion , and remove to a more distant period the accomplishment of their wishes . This matter stood now upon a very different footing from what it did when the question was only respecting the repeal of the penal and disabling statutes . In that repeal it was not necessary for the government to consult
