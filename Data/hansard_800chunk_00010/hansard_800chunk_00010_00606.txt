the reduction of the price of kersey per yard . He would rate the army at 250,000 men , 1003 which was 50,000 less than the number stated by the noble lord ( Castlereagh ) , on submitting to the house his plan for a Local Militia ; but he ( Mr. Wardell ) was anxious to proceed in his calculation according to the most moderate ratio . Each man was allowed a great coat once in every 3 years . He took the number of great coats for one year at 80,000 , certainly below the fair proportion for the year ending Dec. 1805 , during which the kersey had fallen two-pence per yard , being sold for 4s . 4d . per yard ; according , then , to the original condition , every great coat should have been sold for 15s . 10d . instead of 16s . 6d . per coat ; here , then , had the original contract been adhered to , there would have been a saving of 8d . per coat , which in the expenditure of one year , would have been a saving of no less a sum than 2,666l . 13s . 4d . In the following year , kersey selling for 4s . 2d . per yard , the price of the great coats should have been at the rate of 15s . 2d . per coat , instead of 16s . 6d. , which making a difference of 1s . 4d . per coat , would be to the public a saving of not less than 5,333l . 16s . 8d . Again , in the year commencing 1806 , when kersey sold for 3s . 6d . per yard , each great coat , according to the original stipulation , should have been sold for 12s . 9d . each , instead of what they were then sold for 16s . 6d . each ; whereby , the contractors had a profit of 3s . 9d . per coat ; and thus there was an unnecessary waste of the public money to the amount of 15,000l . so that in the course of three years , the saving of the public money , if the original stipulation had been adhered to , would have amounted to 23,000l . It appeared further , that no reduction whatever had taken place in the charge for the clothing ( notwithstanding the serious reduction of the price of the material ) till the 1st of Feb. last . For this reduction , certainly no thanks were due to the right horn the Secretary at War , but to the repeated offers on the part of the majority of the clothiers to supply the clothing at a reduced price . He would prove , if he had not already done so , that the loss of public money , under this system of favoritism , by the means of private contract , amounted in the course of three years to 23,000l . On the 29th of June , 1806 , the firm of Messrs. Scott and Co. offered to supply great coats for 20,000 men , at the rate of 14s . 9d . per coat . To this proposal they never received an answer ( hear ! hear ! from the ministerial benches ) . It was true 1004 that this part of the charge did not affect the gentlemen opposite ; but this would shew , that he ( Mr. Wardell ) was not influenced by party motives ; and that in the discharge of his duty as a member of parliament , to the public , he would be equally indifferent to either friend or foe [ hear ! hear ! ] .â€”He contended , that had this offer of Scott and Co. been accepted , it would have been a saving of the public money to the amount of 21,875l . ; and still more to evince , the folly of not acceding to their offer , it appeared that the same house afterwards accepted of a partial interest in the contract made with Pearse , and
