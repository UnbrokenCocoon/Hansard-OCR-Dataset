be observed , that they have always had it in criminal prosecutions . Many parts of the country have expressed themselves strongly in favour of the measure , and there has not been an opinion expressed against it anywhere . Two meetings of the Faculty of Advocates have been held on this subject ; the first , where the resolutions brought forward by lord Granville were discussed . The introduction of trial by jury in civil causes was then considered by that learned and enlightened body , and it was eagerly approved . At another meeting of the Faculty of Advocates , held on the 23d of February last , called by persons not supposed to be favourers of lord Grenville 's measure , and not attended at all by those who were supposed to be more particularly the supporters of that measure , it was resolved , 'That the introduction of 'the trial by jury , in certain civil causes , 'would be of evident utility to the subjects within Scotland , and that the commissioners should report in what manner 'and form it could be most usefully established . ' This resolution of the Faculty of Advocates was , I believe , the real cause of introducing the recital I have just mentioned into the bill . Had it not been for that resolution , I verily believe the introduction of trial by jury would not have been thought of by the framers of the bill . All this gives but little hope of the accomplishment of that great object ; and when I observe how much the language of the bill fails short of the resolutions , I confess my fears are very much increased on this subject.—In the resolutions , it is said , that it would be 'of evident utility to the subjects within Scotland 'to introduce the trial by jury . In the bill , all that is said is , that 'it has been conceived that it 'might be for their utility to introduce it . ' If the legislature thus discourages the measure which it pretends to promote , it is quite impossible to be sanguine on the subject.—it is farther material to observe on this head , that the bill requires that the commissioners shall report , as speedily as may be , on the subject of the trial by jury , but that it does not require a speedy report on any other of the matters referred 1070 to the commissioners . Under other circumstances , I should have anxiously wished for a speedy report on the introduction of trial by jury , but as things are now circumstanced , I sincerely hope that the commissioners will take all the latitude , and use all the delay that the act will allow —'that they will take full time to deliberate—that , by repeated consideration , and mature deliberation , they will become gradually convinced of its fitness for those commercial and other causes to which I have so often alluded , and which are the assigned motives for the introduction of the bill now under consideration—that they will thus be induced to report in favour of trial by jury in every competent case . It is clear , that a hasty report , under the prejudices which now clearly exist , must be an unfavourable report , and the people of Scotland may thus be deprived , not only of the best and west institution for the administration of justice , in issues of fact , which the wit of man has ever yet contrived , but of an institution which has the greatest possible influence in forming the national character.—When men are daily called upon to administer justice to their equals , to consider and weigh the rights of others , they are sure to contract the habit of forming a just understanding of their own rights and privileges ; and although the administration of justice , on sound principles of judicial jurisprudence , is the primary object of the measure under consideration , yet it is no unimportant feature in the case , that the means of accomplishing
