also which worldly policy loudly calls upon us to accede to in the present very serious crisis—a crisis which demands the union of the wise and brave of every description and of every denomination ; that cordial union , I mean , which is most assuredly the best support , and indeed the only secure bulwark of every government upon earth . It is unnecessary to add , that an union of this kind , can be obtained only by confidence and conciliation : but , if worldly policy did not thus loudly call upon us , a principle of gratitude should lead us to pay all the attention in our power to these numerous loyal and respectable petitioners , to whom we are in a great measure indebted , for the noblest monument of wisdom and beneficence combined , which modern times have seen : I mean the union of Ireland with England , an union , which , without their cordial co-operation , could never have been effected.—In reply to these observations , which appear to me to carry some weight with them ; there are who maintain , that if there were no other objection the words of the Coronation Oath present an insuperable bar to the claims of the Catholics of Ireland . Of all the arguments , my lords , which either principle or prejudice had suggested , or which imagination has started , there is not one , which appears to me to rest upon so weak a foundation , as that which is built upon the words of the coronation oath . This oath , as your lordships well know , underwent some alteration at the period of the Revolution in 1688 , at which period , that great prince , William the third , entered into the following solemn engagement when he ascended the throne of this kingdom : — ' I will maintain the laws of God , the true profession of the gospel and the reformed protestant church established by law ; and I will preserve to the bishops and clergy of his realm , and to the churches committed to their charge , all such rights and privileges , as by law do or shall appertain unto them , or to 680 'any of them . '—If , my lords , even intelligent and honest men , were not sometimes disposed to adopt any mode of reasoning , however weak , which coincides with their preconceived ideas upon a subject , it would be no easy matter to find out upon what principle of fair construction , the words which I have just just repeated from the coronation oath , can be thought to militate against the claims of the Catholics of Ireland . It will not , I trust , be said , for I am sure it can not be proved , that it is either repugnant to the 'laws of God , ' or , to the unconfined and benevolent tendency of the gospel , or to those liberal and enlightened principles upon which the reformation was founded : to admit to situations of honour or of profit in the state , men of talents and of virtue , to whom no objection can possibly be made , but their speculative opinions of merely a religious nature ; nor can I conceive in what manner 'the rights and privileges of the bishops and clergy of this realm , or of the churches committed to their charge , ' can be affected by granting civil and military appointments to men , cordially devoted to the civil constitution , and who have solemnly declared upon oath , that it is neither their intention , nor their wish , to injure or disturb the ecclesiastical . For my own part , my lords , as an individual clergyman of the church of England , sincerely attached to the established church , and proud of the situation which I hold in it , I should be exceedingly sorry , if I could think for a moment , that I possessed any rights , or privileges , incompatible with the just
