makes his appearance in his lion 's hide , pops his head through a hole in the neck , and says , 'do n't be alarmed , for I who 'act Lion am not Lion , but Bottom the weaver , do n't be frightened , and if you were frighted , ' twere pity o'my life , I 'll roar ye as gently as any sucking lamb . '— The learned gent , who had just sat down , had expressed his disbelief of the existence of any unconstitutional influence exercised by irresponsible persons , and controling the responsible ministers . This influence , however , was felt early in the present reign , denounced first by my lord Chatham , and he believed the public was well convinced it did exist—a mysterious and malignant power whose hand , felt , not seen , had stabbed the constitution to the heart.—But of all the many curious circumstances which had attended the progress of this bill , nothing appeared to him more curious than the conduct of ministers about it : they were not for it , and they were not against it : to the court they apologized for themselves , saying— 'We are not against it , because it will do you no harm : ' to the people , 'We are not strongly for it , because it will do you no good ; we do not wish to delude you , the measure is trifling , ( nugatory , said the secretary at war , ) it would be deceiving 28 and raising the expectation of the people , only to disappoint it ; it would afford them no relief . ' Now , he perfectly agreed as to the inadequacy of the measure—the smallness of the boon ; but , it was a commencement of reform , it acknowledged the principle—the necessity ; and therefore , he should vote for it . He would also observe , that it was the last drop that made the cup to overflow ; that the people were full of grievances and sufferings , tossing and tumbling on the bed of sickness ; that they at present turned their anxious eyes towards that house for relief—that they should beware how they disappointed them , and turned their eyes elsewhere in despair.— But , it seemed , that ministers objected to a measure so inadequate , so paltry , not worth the people 's acceptance . They had better stomachs for reform—wanted something more substantial . He supposed they wished for some independent country member to get up and propose that the ancient undoubted right of the people to annual parliaments , chosen by themselves , should be restored—or that no person bribed , or who should be bribed by a place or pension should have a seat in the commons house — that the good old laws of the land , Magna Charta , Bill of Rights , and Act of Settlement , should be restored , by repealing all those unconstitutional acts which had nearly annihilated them ; or some other proposition worthy to be entertained by an English house of commons . —He could not sit down without expressing his astonishment at the quarter from whence the opposition to this very moderate measure came , —from those who , for doing nothing , had received and were receiving large sums of public money , who ought to have been the very last to oppose it , or rather , who ought to have been amongst its most chearful patrons and promoters— even though actuated by no other motive than that which guided every prudent tradesman , and make him consider present security , as well as future gain . He would , and with no unfriendly voice , call upon those persons to consider , whether , by their opposition to this bill of Reversion , they might not produce bills of Resumption ; whether they might not , by opposing this small commencement of reform , cause themselves speedily to hear sounds the most unpleasant , he should suppose , to their ears—for he would have
