in which the reports are made . He shews the reliance which is placed in them , and the effect which they have had in forming , methodizing , and confirming the law of England . I hope I am not guilty of any disregard or want of attachment to the country to which I belong , by shewing great anxiety and extraordinary earnestness to extend to that country a system which has been attended with such real solid benefit in this country , and that I am not deceived by an unjust and partial leaning to the institutions of this country , in which I have contracted my legal habits , and formed my professional opinions , when I consider that the mode used here is calculated to promote and serve all the great objects to which I have so often alluded Namely , responsibility in judges for what they say , as well as what they do , correctness of judicial character , great previous consideration of the subject , and due attention to the mode of delivery ; these are its effects on the judges . As to the law , it affords a certain means of discovering the principles of decision in the particular case ; of ascertaining the grounds of difference where the court is divided ; of appreciating the value of different opinions or judgments which may have taken place . It is the grand and principal source and fountain of the law , and affords a sure and certain mode of ascertaining it at the time , of fixing it , and handing it down to posterity . It is from those voluntary acts of reporting by individuals that the law of this country has derived the most extraordinary advantages . It is to the liberal encouragement thus given by the judges of England to the efforts of individuals , that we are indebted for the re- ; ports by which lord chief justice Dyer and sir Edward Coke enriched the law of England , and that we have such just memorials of the decisions of lord Holt and lord Mansfield.—All this , as I have just said , has been the result of the voluntary acts of individuals who have addicted themselves to this pursuit , and it has been fortunate for England that such persons existed ; for their labours , without any establishment for the purpose , sanctioned by the subsequent approbation of the courts , where their reports have been received as authentic evidence of judicial opinions , has attained the end.—It may be thought by some , indeed , that an establish- 1083 ment would have aided these exertions . But in England it appears that the authority of the state was not necessary to prevent a particular set of prejudices from obstructing the voluntary labour of individuals in this great work of public judicial utility.—It is not so , however , in Scotland . There are many persons of high authority there who may be unwilling to have it set about at all ; and it is very unlikely , especially after what happened to Mr. Bell 's reports , that an individual will again attempt reporting upon this plan . To remove all those difficulties , I should think it advisable to counteract the prejudices of the court by legislative authority ; and to provide most minutely and particularly for all the means of accomplishing a system of reporting in the most perfect manner , instead of collecting decisions in the present form , where the opinions of the Judges , as I have said , are never given , but only the mere words of the interlocutor or decree.—There ought to be an institution of short hand writers to take notes of the arguments of counsel , and the opinions of the judges ; these , when translated from the short-hand , should be delivered over to the collectors of decisions , an institution which might thus be rendered very useful , to methodize and abridge , and give them legal shape , form , and correctness . In extraordinary cases , the judges themselves
