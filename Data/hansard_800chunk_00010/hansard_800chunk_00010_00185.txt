, and still more , because in this promise so given , will be found the key to his subsequent conduct : it will hereafter be seen , when the occasion did occur , how he remembered the pledge he had given , and redeemed it with but too faithful punctuality.—The secresy that is one of the striking characters of the whole transaction , now increases in an extraordinary degree . New precautions are devised , and the in terviews with the vakeels ( which had never been hitherto subject to any restriction ) are covered by fictitious pretences , totally foreign to their real objects.—The letter I next refer to , relates a meeting to which the vakeels were invited , under pretence of seeing a mosque , but for the real purpose of learning something of a secret nature , which the nabob Wallajh had long felt a wish to convey to them ; 341 the interview takes place in a tomb near the mosque , and a question is put to them by Omdut ul Omrah , whether they had full powers ? Being satisfied on that head , he proceeds to deliver to them a message in the name of Wallajah : 'That for a long time there had been , without a cause , a veil , ( or want of cordiality ) between his highness and your majesty , which had been productive of injuries to both ; but now that , by the favour of God , a system of harmony , such as is becoming among the professors of Islamism , had taken place , his highness confidently hoped from God , the prime cause of all , that the time past might be amply redeemed ; that for his highness 's own part , considering from his heart himself , his country , and his property to belong to your majesty , he had made it a testamentary injunction to his children and family , taking God and his Holy Prophet to witness , to pray night and day for the pillar of faith , ( that is to say ) your majesty ; and to consider their prosperity and welfare as inseparably connected with your majesty ; that we must ascertain your majesty 's wishes on this head , in a manner satisfactory to both ; and if your majesty should be , from your heart , solicitous of this proposed cordial harmony , his highness would , under the testimony of God and his prophet , detail to us his sentiments fully at the time of our departure , which , please God , would soon take place'—Without adverting to the marriage , which is said to have made at this meeting the subject of a separate conversation with Gholam Ally , I must remark that , either there is a strange confusion in this message , or the words friendship , harmony , & c. must be understood in more than one meaning . The nabob first talks of harmony being established , and then desires them to ascertain if Tippoo is really desirous of the proposed cordial harmony ; they either mean different things , and more is contained in the latter words than at first appears , or the passage is nonsense . Why , we are tempted to ask , is there any anxiety about full powers ? All that was proposed in its simple and obvious sense , had been long ago both proposed and cordially accepted . To desire the vakeels , then , to ascertain the sultaun 's disposition on this point , appears absolutely absurd , and we have no other way of extricating ourselves from the difficulty , but by concluding , that under the words , 'cordial , 342 harmony , was veiled some new and distinct proposition , comprehended by the vakeels and the nabob , and involving in it what was far beyond any common meaning conveyed by the expressions in which it was couched ; as well as beyond that union said to have been already established between the nabob and the sultaun . It could
