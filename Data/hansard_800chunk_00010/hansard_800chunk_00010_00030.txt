the residence of the clergy . He concluded with moving , `` That leave be given to bring in a bill for making more effectual provision for the maintenance of Stipendiary Curates , and for their residence on their cures . '' reprobated in strong terms the principle and real object of this bill , the most unconstitutional that was ever submitted to the consideration of parliament . He was astonished that the right hon . mover should think of persevering in such a measure , after being thrice defeated in his attempt at carrying it into a law . It was not with the amelioration which it proposed in the condition of the subordinate clergy , nor with the alledged purpose of enforcing the residence of clergymen in their respective parishes , that he 55 had any inclination to find fault . His hostility was directed against the monstrous and unconstitutional power which it gave to the bishops over the rectors in their respective dioceses , a power which subjected the property of every rector to be invaded or mulcted , without any proof of improper conduct , merely at the caprice or whim of his bishop . The noble lord concluded by observing , that he feared the right hon . mover was in this measure the organ of a secret influence behind the altar , as formidable and as designing as that which was now ascertained to exist behind the throne . Its object was to introduce into the church establishment a system of rigorous puritanism , the unfailing source of unconquerable bigotry and rancorous persecution . defended the bill , as calculated to produce two desirable effects , namely , an increase of comfort , to the active curate , and the advantage of a resident , clergyman to the parish . coincided with his noble friend , and declared his determination to oppose the bill in every stage .

If any legislative measure should be proposed on the Report , tending to carry that principle into effect , he gave notice that he should feel it his duty to oppose it . There was no sufficient public ground for such a measure , and it would be extremely injurious to the barley counties , one of which he had the honour to represent . He was confident that his constituents would give him instructions to oppose the proposition , and that they would petition against the measure . agreed with the hon . baronet . The landed interest was sufficiently depressed , and the influence of members whose consequence arose from
