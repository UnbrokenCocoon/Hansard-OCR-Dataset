blight for ever the harvest of plunder and extortion , would have to encounter a host of foes , and be assailed by detraction in every form . But to me , sir , and I trust equally to the house , such enmity is in fact its best recommendation—it is a proof that it has effectually accomplished one of its most important objects ; an object dear to the interests of humanity , and the happiness of millions , by destroying a system the most baneful that ever existed ; to which not your resources only , but the country itself , and its inhabitants in all their gradations , were the victims ; which degraded the prince ; which impoverished the landholder ; which oppressed the peasant ; which drove labour from the field , and industry from the loom ; which depopulated the provinces , and spread desolation and misery over the whole face of the land.—But , much , sir , as humanity , much as policy might be interested in the extinction of such a system , had they been the only grounds of the great measure adopted ; however convinced I might have been of the soundness and the validity of each of them , I will readily own I should have thought the justification they furnished incomplete and unsatisfactory . I am too well aware of the danger of such alledged 326 principles of action , and the abuse to which they directly tend ; it is not on these grounds that a pretence of right is founded ; it is on the violation of every tie of public faith , gratitude , and friendship ; on the contempt of the most solemn engagements and binding duties of alliance , connected with a systematic conduct of unequivocal hostility on the part of the nabobs of the Carnatic , supported by facts no man can deny , established by inferences no man can dispute , that the rights we asserted rest , and that this measure was embraced by those to whom the care of the British interests in the East was delegated , and whose first duty it was to maintain and protect them.—The speech of the hon . baronet , and the resolutions , convey but a very imperfect outline of the transaction before us : from the documents on your table alone , can the real nature and character of it be collected . From them it will appear , that owing to the perfidious and hostile conduct of the successive nabobs Wallajah and Omdut ul Omrah , it became the right , and was consequently the duty , of the British government to provide for the security of its interests , as connected with the Carnatic ; the intended exercise of this right having been evaded by the death of the latter , and not acceded to on the part of his natural heir , Ally Hussein , the usual course of succession was changed , and another prince of the same family raised , by our power , to the throne.—The considerations arising out of his statement obviously divide themselves into the rights we possessed ; the duty of exercising those rights , in the manner and to the extent in which they were exercised ; and , lastly , the circumstances with which the exercise of them were attended.—Before , however , I proceed to discuss the points I have adverted to , I feel myself under the necessity of detaining you for a few moments , to refer to the state and origin of our political connection with the nabobs of the Carnatic , because I am desirous of correcting some impressions on that subject , which the hon . baronet 's speech seemed calculated to convey.—Those who are acquainted with the history of India know that the family of Wallajah had no hereditary claim to the situation of nabob of the Carnatic ; that the way to the musnud was opened to Anwar-ud-deen , his father , by the means of two assassinations , of which he was not supposed to be wholly innocent .
