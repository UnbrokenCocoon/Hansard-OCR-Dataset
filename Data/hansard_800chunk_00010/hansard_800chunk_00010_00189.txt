of the hostages should remove the existing channel of it , a cypher was instituted—that in prosecution of this connection , assurances of fidelity had been given to Tippoo , and intelligence conveyed to him accompanied with advice for the regulation of his conduct ; —that in these transactions the utmost precautions of secresy had been deemed necessary , and the interviews held with the vakeels had been covered with fictitious pretences ; and lastly , that the connection , whatever it precisely was , ( for of its nature little doubt can be entertained , ) actually subsisted in full force , integrity , and operation , in the year 1797.—It has been endeavoured to defend this correspondence , and to rescue it from the impressions it is obviously calculated to produce , by an explanation resting in part on a connection of simple friendship , and in part on an alliance by marriage at one time in agitation between the families of the sultaun 347 and of the nabob Wallajah . On the fullest consideration of this explanation I own I have found myself unable to accede to it : the difficulties it presents appear to me insurmountable . If it be possible to suppose a desire of mere friendship without an object , between persons so situated in relation to each other ; if Tippoo Sultaun and Wallajah were likely to feel the influence of a pure disinterested sentimental attachment , it is yet hardly probable that a connection on this ground should have been solicited with so much earnestness and anxiety , as is manifested by the nabob in the first proposition of it , or an intercourse entered into by him at such mighty risks ; nor is so innocent a view of the subject quite consistent with the secret meetings , the various precautions for concealment , the intelligence conveyed , and , above all , with the preparation and transmission of the cypher before adverted to . If , indeed , it is that union and friendship , which as it is said , ought to bind together the mussulman powers ; if it meant to describe alliance and co-operation , mutual support , and inexpiable hostility against those of a different persuasion , —it may be nearer the fact , and remove these inconsistencies I have stated ; but if it does so remove them , it demonstrates by their removal the establishment of that sort of connection which no one can deny was essentially repugnant to the spirit and sense of every engagement under which the nabob stood , and directly subversive of the interests and safety of the British empire in India.—But then there is the marriage . On the discordant accounts of the origin of that affair , as stated by the vakeels , I shall say nothing . I will admit that a marriage might be in agitation ; but a marriage , if it be allowed to have made any part , on their own shewing , can account for a very small part only , of the communications that are related . It confessedly did not come into question till after the return of Ally Reza from Seringapatam ; but before he went there , it must be remembered that this union of harmony and friendship between the sultaun and the nabob , had been proposed , accepted , and established , and for the purpose of continuing it , a cypher had been already transmitted , of which Ally Reza Khan was actually the bearer . In addition to this , sir , as the friendship and harmony commenced before the marriage was agitated , so it continued long after a connection of that kind had ceased to be thought of . 348 Moez ud Deen was the only son of Tippoo , whose alliance was supposed ever to have been the object of a negociation of marriage . The marriages of this prince , however , and his brother , Abdul Khaliel , are recorded to have taken place in the year 1794 , at which time we find ceremonial letters from the nabob
