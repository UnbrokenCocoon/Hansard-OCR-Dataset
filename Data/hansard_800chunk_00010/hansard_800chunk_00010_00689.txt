to suspect , that they were not favourable to the conclusion which ministers wished to draw from the operation of those Orders . observed , that the noble secretary of state appeared to have misconceived a part of what he had said with respect to the operation of the Orders in Council on our intercourse with Spain . Spain , in her present anomalous state , was not , it was true , an enemy ; but still she could not be considered as a neutral , and thus , under the operations of the Orders in Council , her ports would be blockaded with respect to the rest of the world . What he was therefore anxious to learn from ministers was , whether they intended to deal , upon this occasion , in the sale of licences , which he considered a narrow and unwise policy ; and whether they intended to revoke those Orders as far as they regarded the ports of Spain . adverted to the document upon the table , containing a statement of the exports and imports at the port of London for the quarter ending the 5th of April 1808 , to shew the decrease , compared with the corresponding quarters of 1807 ; the exports of British manufactures in the latter being 5,100,000l . and in the former 4,900,000l . ; and the imports , and also the exports , of foreign produce , decreasing in proportion , to prove there by the injurious effects of the Orders in Council . observed , that the amount of the exports and imports was no criterion in itself ; the question was , were they greater or less than they would have been if the measure of the Orders in Council had not been resorted to ? With respect to what had been said by the noble lord ( Holland ) , he now clearly understood the object of that noble lord to be to ascertain , whether it was the intention of ministers to revoke the Orders in Council so far as regarded the ports of Spain ? He could only state , that if the noble lord would suspend his curiosity for a few days , he would find that ministers had not omitted the consideration of this part of 1130 the subject , and he had no hesitation in saying , that in this respect , as well as in others , it was their wish to act with the utmost generosity and liberality towards the Spanish nation . expressed a hope that the narrow policy of taking possession of a few ships , would not be the only stimulus to induce ministers to afford assistance to Spain . He considered the cause of the Spaniards entitled to all the aid and protection this country could afford . expressed himself satisfied with the explanation given by the noble secretary of state . having moved the usual grants to the officers of the house , & c. and among others the sum of 1200l . to Mr. Wharton for his trouble in acting as chairman of the public committees of that house , took occasion to repeat the objections he had more than once urged to this grant , which was equal to the allowance made to the commissioners of customs and excise . The duty to be performed by these gentlemen was constant , whereas the labour of the chairman of the committees of ways and means ceased with the session of parliament ; which it was also his duty to attend , independantly of any emolument . If , therefore , 1200l . a year was a sufficient remuneration for a commissioner of customs or excise , he was of opinion it was greatly too much to be paid for the discharge of the duties of chairman of the committees of supply and 1131 of ways and means.â€”The different votes were then put and agreed to . stated , that the Board of Agriculture had been engaged for some time in collecting Reports of all the different parts of the country , which were to be made the ground work
