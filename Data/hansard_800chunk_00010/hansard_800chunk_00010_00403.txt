, and to answer it in the manner that best became the interests of the empire . —My lords ; I rise , for the first time in my life , to address your lordships , and I rise with unaffected reluctance ; not because I entertain the smallest doubt respecting either the expediency , the policy , or the justice of the measure now under consideration ; but , because , to a person in my situation , it must be exceedingly painful , ( however firmly persuaded he may be in his own mind ) to find himself impelled by a sense of duty , to maintain an opinion , directly the reverse of which is supported by so many wise and good men who belong to the same profession , and who sit upon the same bench with him . Important occasions however , sometimes arise , on which an individual may be called upon to avow his own sentiments explicitly and unequivocally , without any undue deference to the judgment of others . Such an occasion I conceive the present to be , and shall without further apology trouble your lordships with a few remarks.—I have considered , with all the care and attention of which I am capable , the various arguments which are urged against the Petition in favour of the Catholics of Ireland , which has , this day , for the second time , been presented and supported by the noble baron on the other side of the house , with his usual abilities , and at the same time , with that well known regard for the real interest of the Established Church , for its peace , its security , its honour , and its prosperity , which forms , and has always formed so distinguished a part in the character of that noble lord.—These objections , my lords , numerous as they are said to be , may all of them , I think , be reduced under four heads . In the first place , it is asserted , or rather strongly insinuated , that the religious tenets of the Catholics , are of such a nature as , per se , to exclude those who hold them from the civil , and military situations , to which they aspire . It is next said , that if this were not the case , these situations are matters of favour , not of light , and therefore , the Catholics have no just cause to complain that they are excluded from them . In the third place , we are told , that if it were admitted , that the measure were , abstractedly considered , just and right ; it would be highly inexpedient to repeal statutes , which were passed with much deliberation ; and are considered by many , as the bulwarks of the constitution , in church and state . And , lastly , there are some , who contend , that if there were no other objection , the 676 words of the Coronation Oath present an insuperable bar to the claims of the Catholics . I shall not detain your lordships long in the examination of these objections , because they have been repeatedly discussed , and , as it appears to me , very satisfactorily refuted , by far abler men , both in this house and out of it.—With respect to the religious tenets of the Catholics of the present day , it is not a little singular , my lords , that we will not allow them to know what their own religious tenets really are . We call upon them for their Creed , upon some very important points : and they give it to us without reserve ; but , instead of believing what they say , we refer them , with an air of controversial triumph , to the councils of Constance , or Thoulouse , to the fourth Lateran council , or to the council of Trent . In vain they most explicitly , and most solemnly aver , that they hold no tenet whatsoever
