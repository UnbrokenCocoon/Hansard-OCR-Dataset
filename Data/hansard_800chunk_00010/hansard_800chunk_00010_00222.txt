only 68 were executed , not quite a filth part of the number ; in the year 1306 , 325 received sentence of death , of whom 57 were executed ; and in 1807 , the number was 343 , of whom there were executed 03 . If we deduct the number of those who received sentence of death for crimes for which pardon is never , or very rarely , granted , and take the number of those who are convicted of felonies , which have been made capital for some circumstances , which are not in truth circumstances of aggravation , perhaps it will be found that of 20 persons condemned to die , only one suffers death . The question is , whether the administration of justice should be suffered to continue in such a state , where the execution of the law is not the rule that is observed but an exception to it , and where it has been lately said in language , which one would expect to hear rather from the lips of a satirist than from the seat of judgment , that the `` law exists indeed in theory , but has been almost abrogated in practise by the astuteness of judges , the humanity of juries , and the clemency of the crown . `` —His present purpose was to call the attention or the house to one class only of these severe statutes that had , from the change of circumstances , acquired a severity which was not originally intended : those in which the capital part of the change depends on the amount of the property stolen ; such as the statute of Elizabeth , which punishes with death the stealing privately from the person of another property to the value of 12 pence ; the act of William and Mary which makes privately stealing in a shop to the amount of 5 shillings a capital felony , and many other statutes of the same kind . Such an alteration had taken place in the value of money since those statutes passed , that it was astonishing that the law should have been suffered to remain in words the same to the present day ; the offences , in the mean time , having become altogether dif- 397 ferent . Perhaps there was no case which could render more striking the truth of lord Bacon 's observation , that time was the greatest of all innovators ; for in proportion as every thing which contributed to the support , the comfort , and the luxuries of life had grown dearer , the Life of man had become cheaper and of less account.—There were many mischievous consequences , resulting from such a state of things , which did not strike one at first ; but which became more evident , the more they were reflected on . Such laws can not be executed . Juries are placed in the painful situation of violating one of two duties ; they are reduced to the alternative of violating their oath , or what they are sometimes mistakenly induced to think more binding on them , the dictates of humanity . Often against the plainest evidence , juries find the property not to be of the value of which they and everybody else know it to be ; and this comes to be considered , as Blackstone somewhere expresses it , as a `` pious perjury , '' words which one is sorry to see ever put together : for nothing can lead to more immoral consequences , than that men should familiarize themselves with the violation of a judicial oath . The law ought not to remain so . Offenders are often acquitted against the clearest evidence : and the very severity of those laws , by a necessary consequence , holds out an encouragement to crimes . While there are thus two laws , one upon the statute book , and another in practice , a total change has taken place in the nature of that which is considered as the most valuable prerogative of the crown ; the prerogative of
