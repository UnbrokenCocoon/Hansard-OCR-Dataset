placed on the throne of the Carnatic , ; on his acceptance of the above disgraceful and servile conditions. : —4 . That it appears to this house , that the said Azeem ul Dowlah , was raised to the musnud of , the Carnatic , in the room of , and through the disinherison of the lawful successor , prince Ally Hussein ; —that the injustice and tyranny of the act was not more disgraceful to the British name and character than the unfounded pretexts by which it is attempted to be justified , inasmuch as the pretended treason of the said nabobs Mahommed Ally and Omdut ul Omrah , on which the assumption of the Carnatic was founded , although alledged to have , been discovered two years preoeding the death of the latter prince , was never brought forward during his life , and could by no possible construction affect the right of the said All Hussein , the innocent and unoffending successor of the said nabob This house , therefore , is of opinion , that the British power in India , intrusted to the marquis Wellesley , has , in this instance , been employed by him wantonly and unjustly , to deprive the lawful heir to the Carnatic of his undoubted rights , contrary to every principle of justice and equity , 323 in violation of the sacred faith of treaties , and to the degradation of the British name and character in India.—5 . That it appears to this house that the person of the prince Ally Hussein , the rightful nabob of Arcot , was committed to the custody of the said Azeem ul Dowlah , who had , through the undue exercise of the power of the company , usurped his dominions ; that the said prince Ally Hussein , notwithstanding the frequent remonstrances and representations made to the British government , by himself and others , of the , humiliating and degrading state to which he and his family were reduced by such confinement—notwithstanding his representations of the imminent danger to his life , which he anticipated from being placed in the power of his enemy , and the usurper of his throne , was suffered to continue in such custody , until the 6th of April , 1802 , when he died.—6 . Resolved , That policy as well as justice loudly demands the vindication of the character of Great Britain in India , from the reproach of the above transactions ; and that the interests , if not the preservation of our empire there , calls for some public act , which will convince the native princes , that a religious adherence to its engagements , will , in future , characterize the British government . Consistently with these sentiments , and at a time when our implacable enemy attempts to justify his atrocities and despotism in Europe by the example of our conduct in India , it is peculiarly incumbent on the house , in the name of the people of England , to declare openly to the world , that the British parliament never did , or will countenance any act of oppression and injustice in its Indian government . And as evidence of its sincerity , this house resolves forthwith to appoint a committee to inquire into the beforementioned act of the assumption of the Carnatic—the alledged motives thereof—and into the particulars of the treatment of the family of our late ally , the nabob Mahommed Ally and of the prince Ally Hussein , the lawful successor to the musnud of the Carnatic ; and that it be an instruction to the said committee , to inquire into , and to report whether any and what reparation can , or ought to be made to the said family , for the injuries they have sustained by the usurpation of the said Azeem ul Dowlah ; and that , they may further report their opinion by what means the British character can be most effectually rescued from the obloquy and 324 odium incurred from the above conduct of its servants ; and how the British interests
