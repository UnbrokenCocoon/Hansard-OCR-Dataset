; upon that letter , therefore , I wish to make a single observation , without entering into any particular refutation of the statement it contains.—It was originally produced by a motion of my awn . Having heard that parts of it had appeared in the newspapers , and that it might be produced entire if moved for , I was desirous of having it before the house , as well as every other document that could be supposed to bear upon , or elucidate the measure under our consideration . In moving for its production , however , I certainly did not intend to convey any opinion of its authenticity—of that I know nothing . The style and sentiments of the letter , certainly betray the character rather of European ( than of Indian origin , and do not at all wear the semblance of the unassisted performance of a person of the age of Ally Hussein . There is that contained in it besides , which is so averse from all the principles of Eastern governments , that the idea of it could scarcely have entered into the imagination of an Asiatic prince : what I allude to is the recommendation of an appeal to the British people . Yet , sir , it may nevertheless be authentic , and , if it is , I only entreat the house to allow it the weight it deserves , and no more . Even if authentic , it is but , the statement of an individual 368 in his own case , suggesting to his friends applications in his behalf , to every quarter where application might be supposed advantageous—supplying them with grounds of appeal to every feeling , every sentiment , every interest , which could be conceived capable of creating dispositions favourable to his cause ; they are directed to address themselves to the king , to the prince of Wales , to the board of controul , to the court of directors , to the house of commons , and , lastly , to the creditors of his predecessors , the nabobs of Arcot , on whom he appears justly and confidently to have relied , as his best allies in overturning the present arrangement in the Carnatic , and effecting his full restoration to the musnud.—That in such a representation facts should be disfigured , and every topic should be insisted upon that could move compassion for unmerited suffering , excite indignation against injustice and cruelty , or fix upon the measures of the British government the odious imputations of oppression and tyranny , is not to be wondered at ; but , it does not follow that because such statements are affecting , they are , therefore , entitled to our implicit confidence ; it must be remembered , that severe truth is not the distinguishing characteristic of Indian representations , and for the veracity of any one word contained in this letter , no responsibility whatever exists . On the contrary , the report of the commissioners which is opposed to it , appears as an official document , authenticated by men of the highest estimation for truth , humanity , and integrity , deputed by the British government , acting under the eye of the British government , and responsible to it for the correctness of every circumstance and fact related in it . Although there are several points of difference on which I should be glad to remark , I shall leave that task to others , and content myself with dismissing these discordant accounts , with the single observation I have made , in the full conviction , that where contradictions appear ( which can not escape any one in the comparison of the statements , ) the house will feel on which side the truth is likely to rest , and to which its confidence ought to incline.—It is scarce within possibility , that to a transaction of this nature , circumstances of apparent hardship should not be incident ; circumstances to touch our best feelings , to call forth our compassion and sympathy , and to afford the
