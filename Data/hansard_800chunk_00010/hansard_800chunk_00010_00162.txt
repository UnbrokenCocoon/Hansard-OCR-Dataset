had not only been manifested at the time , but that they had been also experienced in the course of the present war.—It seemed , therefore , impossible to justify the measure of issuing the orders in question by attempting to bring it within the application of any admitted principle , or the fair analogy of any precedents afforded by countries , whose conduct it would not be disgraceful to cite as an ex- 306 ample.—But the motive of the measure was perhaps to be found in the view which ministers had taken of the necessity of the expedition against Copenhagen . Being convinced of that necessity , they thought no means unwarrantable , which , in their opinion , were likely to contribute in any degree , to its success . For this purpose , private property was seized , as an instrument of coercion and intimidation , and in the hope that the importance of recovering might induce Denmark to accede to the demands of the British government . Thus was the principle entirely disregarded and inverted , upon which , on all former occasions , such a proceeding had been resorted to . It was not a measure of just retaliation for an unredressed injury , nor of seasonable and provident vigour , founded on the knowledge of a hostile design , which it was intended to counteract , but an act in furtherance of our own measures of severity and violence towards a state , which , it had been distinctly admitted , was not , at that time , chargeable with any hostile intentions against this country . This however , feeble and futile as it was as an attempt at justification , was far the most favourable interpretation that could be given of the causes , which led to this unparalleled transaction . If this were the true explanation of it , nothing could be more obviously just , than that its effects ought to have ceased , as soon as its design was frustrated . To give a retrospective operation to hostilities , for the purpose of appropriating that which had come into our possession under such circumstances , and the seizure of which had not answered the novel and extraordinary purpose for which the measure was resorted to , was surely a most lamentable , and disgraceful extremity of injustice : which however was still aggravated by the fact , that we had ourselves occasioned the hostilities of which this retrospective advantage was taken , and that they were in no degree produced by any aggression on the part of that state , against which , and the unoffending subjects of which , these proceedings were directed . Under these impressions , lord S. said , it was to him a subject of the deepest regret , that when his majesty was advised to declare to Europe the motives which had led to the Danish expedition , a decisive proof had not been afforded , that the plea of necessity , upon which government had rested its justification , was sincere . A declaration that the 307 ships of war , taken at Copenhagen , should be held in deposit , with a view to eventual restitution , and that private property seized and detained under such circumstances as those which had been described , should be instantly restored , would have placed the motives which had influenced the British government out of the reach of suspicion , and guarded , if not exalted the national character.—With respect to ships of war , the house had already decided , and he would not now re-enter upon that subject : with respect to the merchant ships , and their crews , his sentiments were expressed in the three Resolutions , which he submitted to the house.— [ Lord Sidmouth then read the three first Resolutions . ] —On the subject of compensation to those British subjects who had consignments and effects in Denmark at the time of the commencement of hostilities , ( which effects were afterwards sequestrated , ) he was convinced there could be no difference of opinion : they had
