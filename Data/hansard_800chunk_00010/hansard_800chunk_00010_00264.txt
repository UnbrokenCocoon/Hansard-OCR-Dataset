The one side contends , that it was a rule of court , that only one augmentation should be given ; the other contends , that it was a rule of court , that they would only grant one augmentation . If , however , I am right in stating that the court by the act 1707 had no power to augment in any case , where there had been a previous decreet of modification , this last must have been the nature of the rule ; and indeed it is so explained by lord Braxfield , and lord Eskgrove , in the notes of their speeches 1787 , who on that occasion describe this rule as a stretch made by the court . It was , probably , gradually introduced , and originated in the extreme difficulty of discovering whether a parish had been modified under the parliamentary commissions antecedent to the union , in consequence of the loss of part of the records by shipwreck , in the 464 time of Charles 2 , and the destruction of the remainder by fire in 1702 . In whatever manner it originated , it is evident , that the court in practice ultimately assumed to themselves the power of granting in every case one augmentation ; and it is equally clear that there is no instance on record , in which two were ever granted till the case of Kirkden , which came before this house in 1784.—It is true , the respondents have relied on a list of no less than fifty-three cases , wherein they have asserted that second augmentations were granted previous to this Kirkden case : on examination , however , it appears that these are all either cases which proceeded on consent , or cases where decreets of localities were granted , subsequent to decreets of modification ; and far from affording evidence to support the proposition for which they were brought forward , one of them , viz . the case of Marytown , affords evidence that establishes the contrary position ; the interlocutor pronounced in this case , 25th Feb. 1753 , is to the following effect : 'Having considered the prepared state and foregoing debate , in respect of the decreet , of modification and locality , anno 1718 , find the process of augmentation not competent , and assoilzied the defenders therefrom , and decern . '—Such was the law , and such appears to have been the practice of the court , when in the year 1778 the minister of Kirkden brought his , action for an augmentation before the court of session . In this process , appearance was made for the heritors , who contended , that as the petitioner 's predecessor in office had obtained a decreet of augmentation in the year 1716 , the court had no right whatever to grant any further augmentation . On advising the cause , the court found the pursuer barred by the decree of augmentation 1716 . A reclaiming petition was given in , and the court altered its interlocutor , declaring that 'the decree of modification in 1716 , after giving a proper allowance for furnishing communion elements , the stipend thereby modified is within the minimum , and therefore find the pursuer not barred from insisting for an augmentation . '—The heritors in their turn reclaimed , and the lords declared that they again a tered their interlocutor of the 3d of March , and recalled the directions given to the heritors on the 16th of June last , to swear to their rentals in the usual form , and adhere to their interlocutor of the 16th of July 1778.—Against this decision a petition of 465 appeal was presented to this house , the terms of which it is highly necessary for your lordships to attend to : —the powers of the court of session acting as a com mission of teinds , are noways brought under your consideration : it is stated , that 'in this process , appearance was made for the heritors , who contended that as the petitioner 's predecessor in office had obtained
