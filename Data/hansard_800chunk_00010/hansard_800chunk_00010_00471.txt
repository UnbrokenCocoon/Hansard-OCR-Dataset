operating on the fears of the money-lenders . The importance which lord Cornwallis attached to the security provided by the clause of the treaty here alluded to , and to the preservation of that security from acts of injury and waste , is sufficiently shewn by the relinquishment of six lacs of pagodas annually . This large cession had been unjustifiable on any other ground , but if the nabob had fulfilled this part of the treaty it had been well bestowed . The evils which had arisen from this system in past times were well known to lord Cornwallis , and his humane mind anxiously desired to prevent the possibility of their recurrence We know what a scene the Carnatic had presented during these operations ; they had been described by Burke 784 in the following words : ? Inconsequence of this double game , all the territorial revenues have , at one time or other , been covered by those locusts the English soucars ; not one single foot of the Carnatic has escaped them , a territory as large as England . During these operations , what a scene has that country presented ! The usurious European assignee supersedes the nabob 's native farmer of the revenues , the farmer flies to the nabob 's presence to claim his bargain , whilst his servants murmur for wages and his soldiers mutiny for pay ; the mortgage to the European assignee is then resumed , and the native farmer replaced , again to be removed on the new clamour of the European assignee . Every man of rank and landed fortune being long since extinguished , the remaining miserable last cultivator , who grows to the soil , after having his back scored by the farmer , has it again flayed by the whip of the assignee , and is thus by a ravenous , because a short-lived , succession of claimants , lashed from oppressor to oppressor , whilst a single drop of blood is left as the means of extorting a single grain of corn . Do not think I paint ; far , very far from it ; I do not reach the fact , nor approach to it ; men of respectable condition , men equal to your substantial English yeomen , are daily tied up and scourged to answer the multiplied demands of various contending and contradictory titles , all issuing from one and the same source Tyrannous exaction brings on servile concealment , and that again calls forth tyrannous coercion ; they move in a circle , mutually producing and produced ; till at length nothing of humanity is left in the government ; no trait of integrity , spirit , or manliness , in the people . It was under impressions such as are here described , that lord Cornwallis had written to the court of directors in the year 1790 , in the terms quoted by my honourable friend ( colonel Allan ) in the former debate ; and after two years further experience and local observation of the state of the Carnatic , lord Cornwallis determined to relinquish six lacs of pagodas annually to the nabob , without acquiring any other concession for the Company than the following clauses , intended to put an end to that clandestine influence which the worst Europeans had so long-exercised at the durbar , and the right to collect the poligar tribute at the Company 's own expence and risk . 'In consequence 785 of this measure , whereby the districts mentioned in the schedule No . 2 , become responsible for any arrears that may accrue in the payment of the above stipulated kists , the said nawaub agrees that he will not grant tunkaws or assignments on any account on the revenues thereof ; and if , contrary to this condition , any tunkaws or assignments should exist when the said districts or any of them shall be assumed by the said Company , such tunkaws or assignments shall be declared by the said Company and the said nawaub to be of no value , nor shall they remain in effect
