a foreigner to a vacancy in his gift . He vindicated in strong terms the conduct of that right rev . prelate . He did not pretend to know to what case the allusion had reference , but if it applied to the appointment of a learned person who had been ; professor at Smyrna , he could say that it was an appointment highly meritorious ; being to a gentleman of whom , except from his character for eastern learning , the right rev . prelate had no knowledge ; and was to be considered as a retaining fee to enable the person in question to prosecute the enquiries into the Scriptures , which he had commenced . The right hon . member concluded by moving for leave to withdraw his first motion , that he might move that it be an instruction to the committee to make provision for extending the bill to Ireland . declared himself the last man in the house ' to oppose a well-regulated reform with respect to the establishment of curates . As far as the bill went to propose a remedy for that great grievance , he gave it his support . He must , however , say , that it did not meet the existing evil in Ireland , nor was it calculated generally to answer the ends for which it was intended.â€”The question being again put , that the Speaker do leave the chair , conceived that there was no call for the bill .

He proposed that the president and four censors of the College of Physicians , and a certain number of the College of Surgeons , should be placed at the head of this Institution , to whom all doubtful cases should be referred .
