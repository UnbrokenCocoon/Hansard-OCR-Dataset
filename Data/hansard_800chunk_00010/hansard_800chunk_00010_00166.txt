Danish majesty , have been seized and detained under orders , and instructions , issued before information was received by the British government of the commencement of hostilities with Denmark , and at a time when 312 there was no alleged or supposed cause of war , or reprisals ; and , when in pursuit of a peaceable and lawful commerce , there was an unusual accumulation of Danish ships and cargoes in our ports under the most perfect confidence of security ; and that the said ships and other property have been since condemned as prize to the crown.—2 . That in consideration of the extraordinary circumstances under which the said orders and instructions were issued , it is highly expedient , that , except for the purpose of indemnifying such British subjects as may have suffered from the sequestration of their property in Denmark , the appropriation of the proceeds of the said ships and other effects should be suspended , so that no obstacle may be occasioned thereby to such eventual compensation to the original owners , as circumstances may appear to admit of , and as his majesty , in his justice , and liberality , may be pleased to direct—3 . That it would be highly honourable to the character of this country , that , considering the peculiar circumstances of the present case , all mariners and others , detained and taken under the orders and instructions aforesaid , should be released upon such terms and conditions as his majesty may think fit to require.—4 . That at the time of issuing the orders and instructions aforesaid , there were also in the ports of this kingdom , many ships , and cargoes , belonging to subjects of his Danish majesty , which , having been unjustly and wrongfully brought into the said ports , had been decreed to be restored to the owners ; and that many more then under adjudication , must , as it appears , have been in like-manner , decreed to be restored ; that freight-money , to a large amount , had been , and other sums of the like nature must have been , pronounced to be due ; all which ships , cargoes , and freight-money , have , in consequence of the supervening hostilities , been condemned as prize to the crown.—V . That it is essential to justice , and to the honour of the British name , as well as conformable to the ancient practice of cur courts , and to the established principles of the law of nations , that effectual means be adopted for giving to the owners of the said ships , and other property , the full benefit of the decrees pronounced in their favour by the High Court of Admiralty , or by his majesty 's High Court of Appeal for prizes ; and the adoption of such means is rendered the more obligatory on the faith of this na- 313 tion , inasmuch as the positive stipulation of a treaty then subsisting between this country and Denmark , was intended to provide against a delay , which , however unavoidable in the present instances , has proved so injurious to the interests of the subjects of Denmark.—6 . That it is equally essential to justice , and to the honour of the British name , that the crews , or such part of them as had remained in this kingdom for the better custody and protection of the ships and cargoes , so as aforesaid ordered to be restored , should no longer be considered as prisoners of war.—7 . That the principles of the foregoing resolutions be considered as extending to the proceedings of all his majesty 's courts of prize , wherever the facts of the case , which at present are not before this house , shall warrant their application . '' contended , that the real question before the house was not with respect to those principles of justice alluded to by the noble lord , but with respect to their application , under certain circumstances ; it being quite clear to his
