executors should , as speedily as possible , explain its construction . This vote was carried into effect by a separate bill , and was also incorporated in the appropriation act : 3,600l . had been voted in a committee of supply , to Mr. Phillips , on the condition of his discovering the composition of a powder for destroying insects . This vote was carried into effect by a separate bill , which was in the lords ; and it did not appear in the appropriation act . Two or three years afterwards Mr. Phillips renewed his application , and the house of commons , in a committee of supply , voted him 1000l . This vote was carried into effect in a separate bill , which bill was also lost in the house of lords , and it did not appear in the appropriation act.—Thus it appeared that out of these five cases the house adopted one course in three instances , and another course in the remaining two . The same variety of proceeding would appear on an examination of different grants that had been voted for public purposes . In some 1012 cases these votes had been carried into effect solely by separate bills ; in others they had been incorporated in the appropriation act . For the construction and improvement of Westminster Bridge various sums had been voted at different periods . On the 13th of May , 1742 , 20,000l . : on the 24th—,1754 , 25,000l . In both these cases the votes had been caried into effect in separate bills , and had not appeared in the appropriation act . On the 27th of June 1742 , 25,000l . ; in 1743 , 25,000l . ; in 1754 , 2,500l . ; all which had been carried into effect by separate bills , but had also been incorporated into the appropriation act . It was evident , therefore , that in these instances , all relating to the same object , the house had been influenced solely by convenience . There were various other similar grants . On the 2d of March 1756 , 10,000l. , for widening the streets of Westminster ; and in May 1758 , 10,000l . for repairing Milford Haven ; which votes were carried into effect by separate bills although they appeared in the appropriation acts . In 1759 , 10,000l . for Milford Haven ; on the 9th of May 1759 , various sums as compensation for the purchase of lands at Portsmouth and Plymouth ; on the 23d of March 1762 , 5,000 for paving Westminster , and en the 14th of April 1767 , 2,000l . additional for the same purpose . All these votes were carried into effect by separate bills , and did not appear in the appropriation act . From these various cases it was clear that not only on private but on public grants the house had always exercised its own option on the mode of proceeding.—But , there was another class of cases more nearly resembling that under consideration . They were the grants which had been made without any condition annexed . On the 23rd of December 1707 , 2,120l . 18s . 6d . had been voted in a committee of supply as due to capt . James Roach for the arrears of the rent of forfeited estates in Ireland , granted to him by act of parliament . This vote was carried into effect by a separate bill , and did not appear in the appropriation act . On the 28th of January 1752 , 112 , 143l . was voted to the African company as a compensation for the loss of their chartered lands . This vote had been carried into effect by a separate bill , and was not incorporated into the appropriation act . But one of the most material Cases to which the house ought to attend was that of Rye harbour . On 1013 the 25th of Feb. 1745 , the committee of supply voted a grant to his majesty of 23,360l . out of the sinking fund , to enable
