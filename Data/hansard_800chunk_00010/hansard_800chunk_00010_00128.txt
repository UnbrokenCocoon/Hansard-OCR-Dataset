a continuance thereof at this time , orders for the purchase of considerable quantities of wheat and oats have been received by merchants in Liverpool from millers and others in Ireland , at unlimited prices , to be shipped from thence for the supply of districts in that part of the U. Kingdom , where scarcity appears to be apprehended ; and that large supplies of 255 corn are annually received at Liverpool from Scotland ; that these supplies , during the present year , have been much less than usual , owing to the deficiency of the last crop in several quarters of that part of the U. Kingdom , all which tends to enhance still more the price of bread in that town , already too high for the labouring poor generally to afford , and particularly the manufacturing poor , from the present want of employment , and consequent depreciation of wages ; and that , if any insuperable obstacles should prevent this restriction from being extended to Ireland , it appears there would then be a deficiency of 300,000 quarters of foreign supply , to be provided for , if possible , by an extended cultivation of the soil of the U. Kingdom , in order to meet the usual consumption of the country , without taking into the account the extraordinary supplies of corn , flour , and bread , which , in the present situation of affairs , must inevitably be wanted by the West India colonies from the U. Kingdom , as well as that our allies , the Swedes , being deprived of their usual supply of bread corn from the opposite shores of the Baltic , and their own growth being generally inadequate to their ordinary consumption , may at this time be compelled to resort to this country for supplies of barley , which , when mixed with rye , is , as the petitioners are informed , used for bread in times of scarcity in Sweden ; and that , in the opinion of the petitioners , the prices of corn are likely to continue high , though they trust that the adoption of this measure will prevent them from becoming exorbitant ; that the advantage of exorbitant prices even to the farmer is very questionable , experience having shewn that they terminate eventually in uncommon depreciation , while in the mean time the evils that ensue to the public at large are unquestionably great ; and the petitioners feel assured that the house will deem the good of the whole to be preferred to a doubtful interest of one class of the people , however numerous and respectable , a class moreover which being protected , by a special act of the legislature , from the injurious effects of an excessive depreciation of the prices of corn in times of plenty , by bounties on its exportation payable out of the public revenue , ought at other times in fairness and justice to submit chearfully to such measures as may be necessary to guard the public against the contrary extreme of exorbitant prices , particularly in 256 the present peculiar situation of the country , and unprecedented state of the continent of Europe ; and that , with regard to the local interests of any particular districts in which barley maybe chiefly cultivated , the petitioners conceive they have still less claim to be put into competition with a measure of general advantage ; but they are of opinion that even the local interests of the barley countries are not likely to be materially affected by the proposed measure , for though barley is the grain chiefly used in the English distilleries , and though it appears there are some lands in this kingdom where no substitute for the crops of that grain can be resorted to without injury to the farmer , yet , on the other band , it appears there are also lands on which barley is grown where oats would prove an advantageous substitute ; and when the petitioners consider , that of the quantity of barley annually produced in England , only one
