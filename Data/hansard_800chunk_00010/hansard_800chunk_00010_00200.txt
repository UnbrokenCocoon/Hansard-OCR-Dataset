some such plan as that which I have proposed , should be adopted , the inhabitants of the Carnatic must continue to be wretched , the nabob must remain an indigent bankrupt , and tire country an . useless and expensive burthen to the company and the nation—The state of the country was , indeed , deplorable , and it is with grief and shame I add , that our fellow subjects appear to have had but too great a share in contributing to produce that state of things , and not less in rendering abortive every attempt to improve or correct it . With reference to this point , and also with a view to the condition of the country , the necessity , ( if not of the precise change that took place ) of a modification of our relations with the nabob , and a new and more effectual arrangement , in order to realize the objects of our connection with him , I adduce , as my last authority , one which will be certainly deemed disinterested , and to which I am persuaded some gentlemen will pay a degree of respect , they may be disposed to refuse to any other testimony that can be offered , I mean that of Omdut ul Om-rah himself , the purport of whose conversation with lord Hobart , is given in his lordship 's minute of the 24th of Nov. 1795 , on the subject of the modification of the treaty of 1792 , then proposed to him , of which I will take the liberty of reading the following extract : —It has been with the deepest regret that I have found the nabob unmoved by my entreaties and remonstrances upon this subject ; not that he has been insensible to the justice and expediency of what I have proposed ; but , as he has candidly confessed at several interviews with me , that he has not the resolution to comply ; informing me that his native ministers , and European advisers , so perplexed , plagued , and intimidated him , that he could not venture upon the measure , notwithstanding his conviction that he ought to do so—Long experience , not less than the preceding authorities I have quoted , sufficiently pointed out the only change that could , in the nature of things , prove successful . If it was our duty , then , to regard the preservation of our rights , and to fix the happiness of a people whose fate was placed in our hands , could it be otherwise than our duty to enforce the transfer of the civil and military administration as the only security for those rights , and the only remedy for the evils endured by the country.— 364 The value and the benefits of a measure of this nature , had been long and universally felt , both at home and in India . That they were so felt is not to be denied , nor do I desire to deny it . The feeling breathes through every part of the documents on the table . I am aware it may be argued ( as , indeed , it has been argued ) that this feeling alone dictated the measure we are discussing . But , sir , there are happily facts to be referred to , that amply refute such an accusation . Had the sense of advantage , independant of the principles of right and justice , been the governing spring of our conduct , why the long-permitted continuance of the miseries of the Carnatic under our eyes ? Why did the various attempts made by us to correct the inadequacy of our relations with the nabob , as successfully as they were perseveringly resisted , prove uniformly abortive ? Why the restoration of the country to that iron rule , which had so abused and oppressed it , in the several instances when under lord Macartney and lord Cornwallis , it came into our possession , and when policy spoke at least as decisively in favour of retaining it , as it
