petitioners ; and it would be highly inconvenient and disadvantageous that the petitioners should raise the whole of that sum by the means now in their power : —That the petitioners are not conscious of having created or aggravated the financial pressure which the petitioners now feel , but that the same has been produced by a combination of the following causes ; that is to say : 1 . The vast amount of the Debt accumulated in India in respect of the territorial possessions , and the high rate of interest which such Debt bears , the effects of which have been to intercept the surplus of the Indian Revenue intended by parliament to be derived from thence to the commerce of the petitioners , and to occasion large drafts on the petitioners at home for payment of interest on the said Debts , as well as payments for political charges appertaining to the Indian territory out of the home funds of the petitioners : 2 . The very large sums advanced by the petitioners for the expeditions from India before-mentioned , part of which was borrowed in India at a high rate of interest : —3 . The deterioration occasioned in the affairs of the petitioners by a state of Eu- 70 ropean war since 1793 , under the following heads : 1st , in freight and demurage , which , in the course of 14 years , have created an increase of expence to the petitioners by the sum of 7,000,000l . sterling ; 2d , in the increased cost of the manufactures of this country exported by the petitioners , to the annual amount , on an average of 13 years from 1793–4 , of about 1,690,000l . sterling , which increase has not been counterbalanced by an increase in the selling prices abroad of the same goods , nor by diminution in the cost of goods purchased abroad for importation into England ; 3d , in diminution of profits on the Indian investments homeward : —4 . The large supplies in goods and bullion sent out to India and China by the petitioners between the years 1803 and 1806 , exceeding very considerably the returns which have been made them in the corresponding number of years ; those supplies were originally furnished for the purpose of increasing the investments of the petitioners , in order that by increased commercial profits , joined to increased revenue savings , the Indian debt might be in part liquidated ; but in the years 1803 and 1804 , when those supplies arrived in India , great part thereof , particularly of the bullion , was absorbed by the expences of the war then carried on against the Mahrattas ; and in 1805 to aid the Indian finances of the petitioners in the said war , they still sent large supplies of bullion , besides the usual exports of goods , which latter were also , to assist the manufactures of this country , continued to be exported upon an extended scale to India and China in 1806 , all which exports in the said several years are among the more immediate causes of the pressure now felt upon the home finances of the petitioners , the returns hitherto received for the said exports falling , as already observed , far short of their amount : —5 . The comparatively small investments which were sent home to the petitioners from India during the years 1803–4–5 , whereas , if investments in proportion even to the amount usual in preceding years had been sent home they could then have been sold , and would have produced a considerable influx of money into the petitioners ' treasury in England , which would have been ready to have counteracted the effect of the very small sales which in the present state of Europe can only be made , and which tends to the further embarrassment of the affairs of the petitioners : —6 . That anterior to , the pe- 71 riod of 1802 mentioned under the 4th head , and during a period of ten years , from 1797 to 1807 ,
