When strangers were re-admitted to the gallery , we found the chancellor of the exchequer upon his legs ; who , after some prefatory observations , concluded by moving , `` That it be an instruction to the committee of finance , to inquire into the nature of all pensions , places , sinecures , and salaries , arising from the public revenues , and to ascertain the names of the persons so receiving , with the exception of officers holding commissions in the army and navy , and of all the collectors of taxes and revenue , whose salaries do not exceed Â£200 a year .
