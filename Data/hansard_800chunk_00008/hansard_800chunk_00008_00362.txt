consisting of 78,000 , and to raise by ballot 44,000 , of which , 28,000 would eventually be wanted to supply vacancies : of the remaining 16,000 , five were to provide against the loss of that number of ballotted men , whose period of service would expire in a few months ; three to obviate the waste of three or four years , during which , ballot was to be suspended ; and the remaining 8000 were to consist of an addition to the militia of Ireland : a measure which , when brought forward early in 1804 ( combined with the acceptance of offers from several Irish militia regiments , to serve in Great 1112 Britain ) , had been strenuously opposed by persons who had themselves recommended it to Parliament in the ensuing year , and some of whom concurred in urging the adoption of it at this time . To this plan he objected on various grounds : he objected to it , because the very attempt to execute it , must necessarily be accompanied by circumstances , which even its warmest advocates could not fail to lament . Persons , whether ballotted men or substitutes , having entered into the militia , must suppose that they were not liable to be called upon to engage in any other military service : but being there , they are now to be tempted and importuned ; their good and bad qualities worked upon ; their spirit and loyalty piqued and flattered ; their inclination to revelry and irregularity indulged and gratified ; their subordination to their officers relaxed and suspended ; and all this , to induce them to forego , voluntarily , as it is termed , their original conditions of service , and to enter into the line . Though this could not perhaps be justly deemed a breach of faith , it was not , he feared , strictly consistent with fair dealing ! upon that account he felt a strong repugnance to it . He also objected to the measure on account of its uncertainty ; for though it was probable that the men would be obtained , it was by no means clear that this would be the case ; and nothing should be left to chance at such a time . But his objections to the plan were not so much founded upon the danger of its failure , as upon the consequences which were to be apprehended from its success . If effectual , it would deprive the militia , admitted to be now in the highest state of discipline , of 28,000 of its best and most active men ; and with the residue , consisting of 50,000 , were to be mixed and incorporated 44,000 recruits , whose ignorance and inexpertness would furnish constant employment , during a long interval , to the non-commissioned officers , and necessarily suspend the efficiency of the whole body of militia , for a considerable period of time , and under circumstances the most critical . But weighty as these considerations appeared to him to be , there were others not less important ; he adverted particularly to those arising out of the situation in which this measure would place the officers of the militia ; a description of persons who had strong claims to the respect and gratitude of their country . On two former , occasions they had surrendered their personal feelings to the exigency of the public service ; and at those periods , 1113 when our domestic danger was far less , and when a sufficient number of troops could not otherwise be procured for foreign expeditions , then in contemplation , the militia furnished the means of carrying into effect the wishes and plans of government ; but the injury to the militia service itself was immediate and lasting . In 1805 , the measure of recruiting from the militia arose from other causes : in the preceding year it had been provided by Mr. Pitt 's Additional Force bill , that the militia should not receive any further supply of men , till casualties had taken
