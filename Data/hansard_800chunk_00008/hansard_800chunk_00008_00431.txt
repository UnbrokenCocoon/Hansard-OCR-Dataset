and set with our 1209 * hands before us in these times of danger , patiently waiting to see different effects , flow from the same causes ? He feared those who encouraged such hopes would be lamentably disappointed : `` Rusticus expect at dum defluet amnis ; at ille Labitur , et labetur in omne volubilis ¶vum . '' Nothing short of a revolution in the whole moral world could bring about such a state of things , as to produce security from a long continuance of rigour and restriction ; as long as the human mind remained as it was , so long would force alienate love , and oppression engender faction , tumult , and rebellion . His right honourable friend ( Mr. Grattan ) had dwelt with much force on the actual existence of a French party in Ireland ; on such high authority he did not question the fact ; and he thought the cause of its existence might be traced in the uniform neglect of that liberal counsel , which the honourable gentleman had himself suggested through an honourable and long political life . The honourable gentleman had drawn with his wonted energy of expression , a just and horrid picture of that misery , that had invariably fallen from French alliance , on the unfortunate countries who had been in their turns her victims or dupes . But , much as he admired the brilliancy of his eloquence , highly as he admired the principle from which it sprung , strongly as he felt the justice of its application ; still he would take the liberty of saying , that it was at present almost unnecessary ; since the fate of Holland , of Genoa , and of Italy , were so notorious and apparent , that even in the least informed classes of society there were few who were not in some measure acquainted with the atrocities that attended them : yet in spite of all this , in the face of such examples , it was said there still existed a French party in Ireland ! Gracious God ! was it possible to imagine more irresistible argument for a grave , impartial , and thorough investigation into the whole state of that country , than a fact so monstrous , as that , in defiance of these terrible warnings , there were yet men so disaffected , so impatient of British dominion , as even to prefer to it the destructive aid and poisonous embrace of our implacable enemy , and this too among a people as brave , as generous , and naturally as affectionate as any race under heaven.—In the course of the debate , a great deal had been said of the concessions made to Ireland during his present ma- 1210 * jesty 's reign ; but he confessed , he wished the value of them was more apparent to him , or rather that he could think they were so considered by those on whom they had been bestowed . In the year 1782 , he had indeed granted them , in the repeal of Poyning 's law , the important boon of an independent legislature , but then he thought it could not be denied that , subsequently by the union , that valuable privilege had in fact been virtually cancelled ; for it was obvious that in the united parliament , British councils , and British interest must predominate , and therefore he feared Irish objects were only to be attained by the adherence of her representatives to the ministerial side of the house . To that union , however , much as he had objected to it , he was , now that it was established , as desirous as any one of giving permanence and stability , but he was afraid it was the general impression in Ireland , that it had been obtained under false pretences . As the price of her consent , Ireland had been promised all the blessings in spirit as well as form of the British constitution , the Catholics of Ireland had been promised a free participation
