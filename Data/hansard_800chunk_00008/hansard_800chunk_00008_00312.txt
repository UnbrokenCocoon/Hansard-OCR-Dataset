measures . I trust they are not mistaken , and I have the satisfaction of believing from what has fallen from ministers , that they intend taking the earliest opportunity to ameliorate , extend and organize a more complete system of defence and offence ; it would be wasting he time of the house , to occupy it , in endeavouring to prove an imperious necessity , which must overrule all minor objections to such measures as may put our internal security on the best footing , and also afford the best means of preserving our external greatness . Every thinking man 's mind being naturally employed on those great objects , may I be permitted to submit to the house some Suggestions , which I humbly conceive are well worth being considered , and that they may be so modeled as to promise to effect this great object as far as the physical powers of our country will admit . They are the Suggestions of a man , who having served many years at the head of the militia of the county of which he was also lord , ( and had therefore better means of being acquainted with the bearing and operation of the militia laws in the different situations of our country , ) and during several of the campaigns in the American war , in many of the last war with France , and in various parts of Great Britain , employed a strong understanding in weighing the advantages and disadvantages attending this service , according to the different circumstances of our country . Sir , I apprehend , however great our gratitude ought and must be to those enlightened and provident patriots who introduced and established this most important mode of national defence , however competent it has proved to its object during former times , yet no man will contend that , in the present state of Europe , ( which it is necessary only to allude to ) the same system must be applicable . I here must beg leave to advert to what many gentlemen in this house must recollect in 1799 , when a French detachment had landed in Ireland ; many of the regiments of the militia of this country volunteered their services to the sister kingdom , with an alacrity and zeal never to be forgotten . As the laws stood and now stand , an act of the legislature was necessary to legalize the 1054 acceptance of their services . This French detachment after some success , and having advanced considerably into the country , being disappointed in their expectations of a faithful , numerous , and zealous co-operation for which purpose they had brought many arms , surrendered . Had they not been disappointed in this expectation , it is not easy to appreciate , the important advantages that must have resulted from this patriotic act of the British militia ; the act of the legislature however in its progress through the houses of parliament met with much opposition . In mentioning this , I am far from intending to impute any blame to those gentlemen who made that opposition . I am persuaded they acted , according to their view of the subject , in the manner most conducive to the best interest of their country . Gentlemen will also recollect , that on the renewal of hostilities with France , when Buonaparte lined the coast opposite to ours with his legions , and began to assemble his flotilla at Boulogne , many regiments of the Irish militia , seeing England threatened , seized the opportunity of testifying their gratitude by offering to come here ; at the same time some regiments of English militia again volunteered to go to Ireland : at that moment , some most respectable leading characters in that service , thought proper to publish Resolutions expressing strong disapprobation of that measure , and stopped it . I can not help lamenting that they thought their duty so to act , as it is obvious that the facility of mutual defence was and will be thereby embarrassed ; and what is of
