Catholics and other dissenters ; measures always reconcileable to the true principles of wisdom and justice , and now not only imperiously called by the exigencies of the times , 1000 but absolutely necessary to the safety of the united empire . VASSALL HOLLAND ROSSLYN . '' `` Dissentient ; 1st , Because the amendment to the preamble moved upon the report was rejected by the house.—2d , Because though a bill of Indemnity unquestionably implies that the law has been violated , and though it was admitted in debate , that nothing but necessity can possibly justify the violation of law ; yet the frequency and facility with which bills of indemnity have of late years been granted , the sacred nature of the law which has in this instance been transgressed , and the circumstances which gave rise to the necessity , seemed to me to call for some more solemn declaration of the constitutional principles , which by such transgressions of the law are manifestly violated , than a simple recital of the necessity of the violation , and an immediate and unqualified indemnity for it , without reference to the events which produced that necessity , or to the peculiar nature of the illegal measure itself.—3d , Because the principles which have in this instance been violated are so sacred and fundamental in our constitution , that at all seasons and upon all occasions , even if the ground of necessity were incontrovertibly proved , it would become the dignity of the house of lords , and would be consistent with that jealous and independent spirit , which , where the privileges of the subject are concerned , should always characterize a British parliament , scrupulously and anxiously to record , in the instrument of indulgence itself , their sense of those invaluable rights ; the infringement of which nothing but an over-ruling necessity had or could have induced them to overlook.—The right by which the subject is exempted from all taxes not granted by common consent of parliament , has at all times been deemed by sound constitutional lawyers , and has frequently been recognized by parliament itself , to be coeval with the frame and constitution of the kingdom , and has repeatedly and solemnly been declared and secured by charters of our princes and acts of our legislature.—By the great charter of our liberties , in the reign of king John , no aid or scutage can be levied on the kingdom without the consent of the common council of the nation . By the statutum de tallagio non concedendo * , in the reign of Edward I . First , no tallage or aid can be levied by the * 34 Edw . I. stat . 4 . 1001 king without consent of the archbishops , bishops , earls , barons , knights , burgesses , and freemen of the commonalty of this realm ; and as in the frequent remonstrances of the parliaments of Edward III . * the jealous attachment of our ancestors to this fundamental maxim of our constitution is recorded , so in the impeachment , condemnation and punishment of the lord Latimer , which took place at the close of that reign † their determination to enforce it is strongly exemplified : and at subsequent and later periods of our history the endeavours of our forefathers were uniformly , but more particularly in the petition of rights in 1627 , and in the acts of Charles II.‡ recited in the rejected preamble , directed to the solemn recognition and perpetual security of this inestimable privilege . And finally , in that solemn act of the legislature , commonly called the Bill of Rights II , the levying money without consent of parliament , and the dispensing with laws , both which practices have in this instance occurred , are declared and enacted to be illegal.—It seemed , therefore , to me no light or trivial matter , no ordinary or indifferent proceeding , to indemnify persons for the violation of such fundamental maxims of the constitution , and prudence required a solemn and studious declaration of the
