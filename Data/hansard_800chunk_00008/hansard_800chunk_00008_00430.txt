a perfect reciprocity of opinion on all political topics ; the authority of that noble person was with him all but omnipotent : he had likewise so favourable a judgment of all those who were associated with his noble relation in the administration of his government. , that , had they continued in office , he should have consented , by his vote , to the provisions lately enacted without hesitation , though certainly not without deep regret ; giving full credit to their representation of the necessity , and entertaining an implicit reliance on their discretion and forbearance in the exercise of the extraordinary powers entrusted to their hands : but the confidence he should have reposed in them , he could not extend to their successors.—It had been the grand principle of the government over which his noble relation had presided , to conciliate all the differences , to allay the jealousies and animosities that had so long distracted that unhappy country ; to restore the blessing of harmony , to unite all description of man , and , above all , to establish that most important desideratum , a mutual confidence between the people and their magistrates and rulers.—He challenged single instance in which they had departed from that wise and beneficent plan.—Of the noble duke ( Richmond ) who had been appointed to succeed him , he did not wish to insinuate any thing the leas disrespectful ; he knew him to be possess- 1212 ed of many great and excellent qualities , and of his merit in any respect he did not entertain the smallest doubt : —but that noble duke was now officially connected with a party in this country , whose system of policy he more than doubted ; he was convinced it was fundamentally bad ; the duke of Bedford 's moderation had been condemned in that house , by persons now high in the administration of this country , who had deprecated the effects of what they termed his mistaken lenity.—What had resulted from the opposite course which had been pursued with little intermission for centuries ? —The necessity of the late bills ! —And was it really thought possible that the same treatment which had occasioned the disease should afterwards operate as its cure ? —It would be an unwarrantable trespass on the indulgence of the house to go into a detailed examination of the plan on which Ireland had been governed ever since her conquest under Henry the Second , and deduce a regular train of consequences from a perseverance in the same line of conduct towards her , during a period of 600 years ; though such an investigation would undoubtedly open a field of reflection from which many very useful lessons might be drawn : we had throughout treated her only as a conquered country , we had never appeared even to suppose the possibility of her interests being identified with ours ; instead of nourishing her strength , as an addition to our own resources with the fostering care of an anxious parent towards a child ; we had exacted her services as a task-master from a slave , and consequently , both nations had viewed each other with the natural distrust of persons standing in so odious a relation.—It was necessary , however , and sufficient for the present purpose , particularly to draw the attention of the house to the history of the last eleven years , during which the present laws had existed ; they were first adopted , he believed , for 4 years ; —did they in that time remedy the grievance ? —No—they were then renewed for seven , still the condition of the country remained the same ; and we had now been called on to continue them for three more.—We had had sufficient time to judge of the merit of the tree by the fruit it had produced , and surely it was now time to abandon a project that had so indisputably failed . Were we to content ourselves with ringing the changes on the number of years for which such measures were to be passed ,
