make any sacrifices for the public good , and to support their share in its splendour ; yet they expected economy in the disposition of the national money , and that their distresses might be lessened . If these economical reports were heaped on the table without use , he should find it his duty to tell ministers that he would vote smaller supplies than he otherwise might have intended , were more frugality and attention shewn . entirely agreed with the hon . gent . as to the necessity of economy at the present crisis , and a cautious expenditure of the public money . At the same time , he could not approve of the vague and incautious manner in which the hon . gent . had thought proper to fling out his charges . The remarks were of a nature so general and indefinite , that he did not know how to reply to them . If the hon . gent . had any thing definite to state in public or private , he should feel himself much obliged to the hon . gent . for such communi- 1072 cation . As to the reports which were said to be heaped upon the table , he wished the hon . gent . would again be more definite , and , selecting one or more from the number , state explicitly what he understood to be the existing abuse ; this certainly would be much more satisfactory than dealing in loose and general observations . said in explanation , that he alluded to the different reports in the various departments , civil , military , and marine , whereby it was obvious that there might be a saving by a more economical management in each , of the public money , to an amount of between five and ten millions annually . put it to his majesty 's ministers , to consider the necessity and the means of affording a more immediate relief to the persons entitled to exemptions under the income tax : these persons were at present obliged to pay the full amount of the tax in the first instance , and they found it extremely difficult afterwards to obtain the relief allowed to them . stated , that he , as well as the hon . baronet , had received complaints of very severe hardships , in the manner in which the income tax was levied on the lower classes . He was sure if his noble friend ( lord H. Petty ) had continued in office , the necessary relief would have been afforded to the persons so pressed . He hoped the hon . gentlemen opposite would consider of the means of affording them some alleviation . lamented , that in proportion as the property tax had been made more burthensome , the means of relief had been made more difficult in the cases in which no law could presume to withhold it . stated it to have been his desire and intention , that every real grievance under the property tax , as it had been increased and regulated by him , should be satisfactorily redressed ; but he thought it , in the first instance , desirable , that the whole of the provisions should have a fair trial ; for it was only such a trial that could afford proof of the reality , or the futility , of the objections which were so universally made . He was desirous , now that a fair trial had been afforded , to give all proper relief , but he could assure the house , that much difficulty would be felt , when the means of giving that relief consistently with the produce of the tax should came to be considered.â€”The motion for leave to bring in the bill was then agreed to . in consequence of the notice he had given , rose to submit a motion , which he thought necessary as a preliminary step towards any proceeding which the house should think proper to adopt , with respect to the measure founded on a resolution of that house ,
