, as if the cliffs of Dover touched those of Calais , or as if the fleets of France had been as victorious as her armies . Till we can hear without dismay that the flotilla of Boulogne has effected a landing on the coast of Kent ; that a French army of 120,000 men are in possession of Dover , and that 20 or 30,000 more have made their way to Ireland—till we can hear all this without a well-grounded apprehension , I shall not consider the state of our defence as worthy of the name of England . The probability is , that a year may not elapse before such news will reach our ears : and when it does come upon us , what consequence can any reasonable man anticipate if our state of defence remain such as it now is , or such as it will be , with all the addition which his majesty 's ministers now call for ? Let any man of military knowledge , who is acquainted with the present situation and disposition of our regular and militia force , calculate the time regular would be necessary for bringing together an army capable of opposing 100,000 , or even half that number , of the troops of Bonaparte , flushed with all their late astonishing successes . Let him look back to the rapid marches of these troops in the campaigns of 1805 and 1806 , and let him figure to himself what their movement would probably be , were they at this hour landed on the shores of England . Let him say , whether the enemy might not be in possession of London , and of all our military depôts , before our army could even be collected ? whether , advancing with his usual rapidity into the centre of the country , he might not intercept our scattered battalions before they could reach a rendezvous , or 1128 from the semblance of an army fit to oppose him—Last year , we saw Prussia over-whelmed after a short and feeble resistance : Heaven grant that England may not shortly exhibit a parallel , or a still more disgraceful spectacle ! Prussia at least fought a battle before she submitted to the conqueror—England may probably be overrun , before her army is even in readiness to take the field and to face the invader ; and this far-famed empire may be crushed , without our having the glory of making , one stand for the liberties we value so highly ! —Great , my lords , as the dangers are , with which this country is now surrounded , nothing is farther from my mind than to say , that the contest is beyond our strength , or that the resources of this country , if well directed , are not adequate to meet all its dangers . But if that is to be done , it must be by very different measures from this that is now before us , and by exertions of which Englishmen have as yet been little accustomed to think.—In considering the means of resisting the now gigantic extent of the power of France , there is one point abundantly evident , that something more than a standing army , or any description of regular force , is absolutely necessary . I am perfectly sensible , that a strong regular army must be the basis of our defence ; that every other description of force can only serve as accessories ; that , without a large army , nothing can be done by volunteers , or any similar local force , or by any exertion of the zeal and courage of the civil population of the kingdom . On the other hand , my lords , it is equally clear , that if we trust to our regular army alone , if we can not find means of giving effectual support to our army by some species of accessory force , we , must be overwhelmed : it is physically impossible for us to raise a regular army strong enough , to meet that which may
