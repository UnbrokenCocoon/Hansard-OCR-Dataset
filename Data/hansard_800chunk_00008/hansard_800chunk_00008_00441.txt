inefficacy and injustice of the Additional Force bill , but no argument whatever against the renewal of the army of reserve . But the noble lord had laid great stress on the advantages which would arise from the possession of a large body of militia upon the restoration of peace ; as in that event all who had served 5 years would be disbanded . This , however , has a contingent benefit : if the war continued 5 years longer , it would not occur ; and the reasoning , upon which it was founded , went the length of asserting , that such a measure as the present , with all the inconveniences attending it , ought always to be resorted to , when hostilities had been of four or 1228 five years continuance ; and that the country would be made weaker for a time during war , for the chance of being rendered somewhat stronger , than it would otherwise be , on the restoration of peace .
