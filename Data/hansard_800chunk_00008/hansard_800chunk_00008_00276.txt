the 12th year of the same reign , for conferring tonnage and poundage on that monarch , and of the act made in the first of William and Mary , commonly called the Bill of Rights , a bill of indemnity now be passed in favour of all persons , who , since the first of June , have been concerned in the said illicit commerce and navigation between this kingdom and the said united states of America , or in the collection of the said illicit duties and customs arising there from , or who , being bound to prevent such illicit practices , have tolerated or connived at the same . '' The following Protests were entered against the American Indemnity bill : `` Dissentient ; 1st , Because it ought to be shewn on behalf of those whom it is proposed to indemnify for a violation of the law , not only that their act was necessary to preserve the public from injury , but that this necessity was not induced by their fault . In the case on which the house has decided , the necessity was created by his majesty 's ministers themselves , who advised the dissolution of the last parliament , when the consequence must evidently be , that the trade and interest of the public would suffer material injury , or that the power of the crown must be exerted against law , and in manifest derogation of the common liberty.—2d , Because , if on the one hand , the principle of the constitution requires that the power of dissolution should reside in the crown , it is not less true , on the other , that the power of par- 999 liament over the public purse , and the right of the two houses , exclusively to advise his majesty in the making , repealing , suspending and altering of laws , is the proper constitutional check upon this prerogative . But if it be admitted that a dissolution of parliament is in itself sufficient to justify the continuing beyond the term fixed by parliament , and by the sole authority of the crown , the operation of any legislative provision , and particularly of an act of Supply , the power of the purse , and the legislative functions of both houses , would be virtually transferred to the crown , and all the securities which the constitution has provided for the due administration of his majesty 's affairs , and for the property and liberty of the whole nation , would be utterly invalidated and destroyed.—3d , Because at the time of the late dissolution all the measures recommended by government having been adopted , all the supplies granted , and no difference existing between the two houses , or between his majesty and his parliament , it is evident that there was no urgent political and public necessity which could warrant the exposing government to an alternative so serious and important as that which is the subject of the present proceeding . `` —CARYSFORT for the two first reaons : `` And moreover , because the pretences alledged for the dissolution of parliament , viz . the dismissal of the late administration , the discussions which arose upon it , and the causes which led to it were not , in my judgement , sufficient to justify those who advised so unusual an exercise of prerogative , together with a consequent breach of the law and an acknowledged invasion of the rights of the subject.—The notion that either on the bare removal of a ministry , or in consequence of motions purporting to criminate the advisers of the crown , parliament may and ought to be dissolved , has a direct tendency to subvert the freedom of debate , to break the independent spirit of of commons house of parliament , and to render that branch of the legislature the subservient organ of the minister of the day—Nor can any just plea for an extraordinary exercise of prerogative and manifest violation of law be founded on the measures projected by the late administration in favour of Roman
