warrant sanguine expectations of complete success . With this opinion , he greatly lamented the introduction of a clause in the present bill , affording to the militia soldier , on entering into the regular army , the option of serving either for seven years , or for life . A small increase of bounty would probably operate irresistibly at the moment of enlistment , and induce a large proportion to accept the latter alternative : repentance would speedily follow ; all the uneasiness arising from contrast would be soon , and continually , felt : discontent and desertion , he feared , would ensue , and the advantages of the system would , in other respects , be circumscribed , and materially impaired . He was apprehensive too , that this clause might be the forerunner of a similar provision in the mutiny bill of the ensuing year ; and if so , a system founded on the soundest principles and the most enlarged views , must be considered as abandoned and destroyed . This would extinguish the hope , now reasonably entertained , of our being enabled , at a future period , to supply and keep up a large regular army , by no other means than those of voluntary service . But , under the most favourable circumstances , a regular army , sufficient of itself to provide for our domestic defence , as well as for the security of our foreign possessions , could not possibly be raised and maintained ; and , for reasons unnecessary now to be stated , ought not , as he thought , to be desired : auxiliary means must be resorted to , without which , in the event of a landing of the enemy in considerable force , effectual resistance would be hopeless . These means were partly to be derived from the zeal and spontaneous exertions of a large proportion of the community , and from the application of a principle solemnly established by the act of 1803 , of the right of the state to demand the military services of all or any members of the community , for the purposes of domestic defence . Of the first description were the Volunteers , a force which , considering its amount and the spirit which produced it , is without a parallel in the history of the world . Of the disposition of government to cherish and encourage that spirit , he had the satisfaction of being perfectly convinced ; and in general he approved of the measures which 1117 had been adopted for that purpose . In the management of the volunteers , it was essential to manifest a strong and liberal sense of their value ; to avoid , and to discourage , unnecessary expense ; and to aim at such a degree of military discipline and proficiency as may be consistent with a due attention to their ordinary civil occupations . Of the militia ( a description of force raised under compulsory authority ) , he would add nothing to what he had already said , than that he believed it to be impossible that they should long continue to exist upon their present footing , but that they ought to know distinctly what they were to expect in future . The extension of their services to the whole of the United Kingdom could not , as the establishment was now constituted , be reasonably expected ; and , indeed , without far more consideration and indulgence than for several years past it had been judged proper , or perhaps been found practicable to show , for the personal convenience and comfort of individuals belonging to the militia , it would be fruitless to hope that a large number of ballotted men would serve , or that the regiments would be officered by a considerable proportion of noblemen and gentlemen from the counties in which they were respectively raised . He was strongly inclined to think that the connexion of the militia with the volunteers , for the purpose of forming local and provincial corps , which should remain in their different counties ,
