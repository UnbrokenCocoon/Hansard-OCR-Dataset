in the nature of things , elapse between the commencement of those operations and the final attempt to bring them to an issue . The first period could not possibly be before the autumn ; the next would extend at least till winter ; and the final attempt would not be before at least a year had passed by : twelve months must first elapse , and at the end of that period , in what state would they find the force of the country ? just at that moment the effects of the noble lord 's bill would have operated , so far as to have , by that time , disorganized the defensible force , and the ballot , at that time , would not have been completed . Let the house , then , mark the injustice of the bill as affecting the militia . The militia might at that moment , be brought into action , when the country would inconsiderately , but very naturally , entertain precisely the same sentiments of its character and promise that it now so jutly did ; and what must be the result might be easily foreseen by any man who knew how ill calculated a set of raw recruits must be to supply the place of an experienced and disciplined soldiery . He had seen the first draught that had been made from a militia regiment in Kent , and an hon . gent . over against him had been present at the same time : he confidently appealed to that hon . gent. , if he ever witnessed such a shameless exhibition of drunkenness , idleness and dissoluteness , as upon that occasion . The defective situation in which these men were found on the subsequent expedition to Holland , was too well known to require any comment from him . He had been further assured by a general officer , who was very capable of forming a correct judgment on the fact , that after their return from that unfortunate service , it would take nine months to make these men fit for any other.â€”The evils and hardships of the measure now before the house would be felt most sensibly in recruiting the militia after the draft . The militia was in effect made up of substitutes , and those who now should be balloted and could not serve , must of course find substitutes , whatever price they might cost . The conscription enforced 945 throughout France was spoken of as worthy of being imitated here . If it was , let us come to it manfully , and let us not practise it indirectly , but more partially and oppressively , by beating up the militia , and then allowing it to feed till it filled itself , in order to devour it . He must say he had a better opinion of the army of reserve than of the measure now before the house . But even that measure justified in the execution , the objections he had felt , and made to it , while passing through the house . He had , notwithstanding the disapprobation he had felt and expressed , contributed most zealously and actively in carrying that measure into effect ; and he was sure every member would enforce this , or any other measure , with equal zeal , let their private sentiments of it be what they might . He again enforced the folly of having recourse to temporary expedients , to the destruction of lasting resources . The present expedient was a kind of fungus springing up and perishing as soon as it was plucked . The existing force was sufficient for all the exigencies of the time , even though the great door , which was about to have been opened for engaging the Irish Catholics to enlist , appeared to be irrevocably shut , [ a cry of no ! no ! ] at least while the right hon . gent . opposite should remain in power . The system which his right hon . friend had introduced to supersede and remedy that system of
