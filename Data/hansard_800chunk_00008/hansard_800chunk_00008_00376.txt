only question now is , how their numbers can be most effectually augmented ; and were any member of parliament now to repeat the declamations against standing armies , that were formerly so popular , what would he meet with but ridicule ? The result then of this magnificent experiment has been , not only to prove the perfect safety with which the people may be trusted with arms , but to establish a degree of mutual confidence between the crown and the people heretofore unknown , and to fix it on an immoveable basis . If the volunteer establishment had done no other service to England than this , I should think the ministers , who had accomplished so noble a work , entitled to the lasting gratitude of their country.—But , my lords , while I pay a just tribute of praise , both to the individual merit of the volunteers , and to the utility that has been derived from the institution , I can not shut my eyes on the intrinsic difficulties , which stand in the way of every attempt to form on this basis an efficient defensive force ; and , at a moment like this , when every exertion of which this nation is capable , will not be more than adequate to the crisis in which we are involved , I should think it a very ill judged compliment , to persist in expecting from the volunteers , a species of service for which they are not formed , and to neglect the means that are in our power , of drawing from the mass of the people a 1132 more efficient species of defensive force.—It is admitted on all hands , that the discipline as well as the numbers of the volunteers has experienced a material decline . On this I should not be disposed to insist much , if it were merely an accidental circumstance ; for I am well convinced , that when the necessity of renewed exertions becomes manifest , the energy of the volunteers may be revived in proportion to the apparent exigency of the crisis.—But , my lords , it would be deceiving ourselves , to consider this decline of the volunteers as an accidental circumstance : it has arisen from the very nature of the institution . A system , the efficiency of which rests so entirely on individual exertion , can not be permanent and steady in its effects . At the period when the volunteer establishment was formed , the loyalty and patriotic spirit of the people had been roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm . The apparent danger of the country called forth unprecedented exertions of spontaneous zeal ; but as the exigency became less apparent , these exertions naturally relaxed . Even before there was any evident change in the situation of public affairs , the energy of this spirit had begun to decline . Such vehement efforts of enthusiasm could not be of long continuance : the public mind had been on the stretch , and naturally sunk back into a state of languor . To this is to be added , that military exercises were , to many of the volunteers , so great a contrast to their ordinary occupations , as to be a recreation while the attraction of novelty continued : but when that zest was lost , it has been found in general very difficult to preserve their attention unimpaired . From this cause , men of experience have observed , that the state of discipline in the volunteer corps , has in many cases followed an opposite rule , from that which is found to obtain among regular troops ; among regular regiments , the oldest is generally supposed to be the best corps ; among volunteers , it is more frequently the newest.—This instability must be expected in every institution , the efficiency of which rests on the efforts of voluntary zeal ; and even if we could reckon with certainty on the revival of an enthusiastic spirit , upon every occasion of danger , that would not be enough .
