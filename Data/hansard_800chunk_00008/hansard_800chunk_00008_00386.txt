force that would be gained by the adoption of the measures I have now 1146 suggested , can not be deemed extravagantly great for meeting the exigencies to which we may ere long be reduced . But were it otherwise , it is right that our preparations should be superabundant : if the least shadow of doubt can remain as to their sufficiency , they are not what they ought to be . Even on principles or œconomy , our defensive force ought to be ample and superabundant . Granting that a more scanty plan of preparation should ultimately prove sufficient , and that the invader should in the end be repulsed ; yet if this is to be done after a severe contest on English ground , our country would suffer from the desolation of a protracted warfare , far greater losses than would be sufficient to balance the utmost inconvenience , that could possibly be apprehended from preparations unnecessarily great . By providing ample means of defence , we have the best chance of deterring our enemy from the attempt at invasion , and thus saving our country from the ravages of war , or at least of shortening their duration by insuring the speedy overthrow of the invader . But can any one reflect for a moment upon the countless horrors that would ensue if our means of defence should prove inadequate , can any one reflect that it is for the liberties , for the very existence of England that we are to fight , —and be content with scanty preparations ? Who is there that can imagine without horror , our aged and beloved monarch weltering in his blood , —his place occupied by a heptarchy of French usurpers , the minions of the conqueror , —the family of our sovereigns , along with the sad remains of , all that is now eminent and dignified in England , wandering as exiles in foreign lands , while the mansions of our nobility are parcelled out to French generals , and every thing that is desirable in England becomes the prey of a Frenchman , —all the comforts which industry and œconomy have accumulated around the dwellings of our yeomanry , our tradesmen , and our manufacturers , scattered to the winds , the pillage of a licentious soldiery , —all the civil and religious institutions , that have hitherto been the boast of Britain , trampled under foot , —our people left to groan under the oppression and contumely of insolent and domineering strangers , forced to submit to every wrong and to every insult , with the sad reflection , that they have no longer the protection of English law , of an English magistracy , or an English jury * ? All this , my lords , This is but a faint and feeble sketch of the 1147 and yet more than this , we have to guard against ; and shall we then consider the inconvenience , of making preparations rather greater than absolutely necessary , as deserving of a moment 's thought ? —By the adoption of the measures which I have detailed , our situation may be rendered perfectly secure ; and if our activity and resolution be commensurate with the exigency of the crisis , a very few months may be sufficient to bring our preparations to maturity . With such a local militia , as I have suggested , to back the efforts of our regular force , I should consider our army as already sufficiently numerous ; or at least there would be no necessity , of resorting to a measure so objectionable as the ballot , for obtaining an immediate augmentation of our disposable force.—I am ready to admit to the noble secretary of state the advantages , which a regular and disposable force must have over an equal number of troops of any other description , even for the purposes of defence . But these advantages may be purchased too dear : and certainly , if ever there was a conjuncture of affairs , in which these advantages were of less value than usual ,
