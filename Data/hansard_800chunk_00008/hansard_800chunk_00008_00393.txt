for the present , trusting that the house would take up the matter with that seriousness which its importance seemed to deserve.—The hon gent . then presented the petition , which was read at the table . It stated , `` that the petitioner , Nathaniel Highmore , doctor and professor of civil law , and member of Jesus college , Cambridge , was , during 11 years , a student of civil law in the university of Cambridge , in consequence of which he obtained the degree of doctor and professor of civil law ; and that this degree has ever been held , as by the statute and canon law ordained , a qualification for , and as giving a right to exercise the profession of , an ecclesiastical advocate in the courts of civil and canon law , holden in Doctors Commons , and which courts are placed under the administration of the archbishop of Canterbury ; and that the rights , privileges , and immunities of the university of Cambridge are guaranteed and secured by divers royal patents and charters , confirming the same to its different members , and to their several academic degrees ; by one of which charters , it is especially provided , that doctors in civil law shall experience neither hindrance nor obstruction in their admission into all ec- 1157 clesiastical offices , whether with or without the cure of souls , the latter of those , as the petitioner conceives , including the office of an ecclesiastical advocate ; and this , together with the other charters of that university , was confirmed by an act of the 13th Elizabeth ; and the petitioner further states , that having received from the register of the said university a certificate of such his full and complete qualification , he did , consequence thereof , duly and regularly obtain the fiat of the archbishop of Canterbury , in pursuance of which his grace 's rescript , or commission , appointing him to this ecclesiastical office , was made out , and sealed with the seal of the vicar-general of the province of Canterbury ; and that having , notwithstanding such his qualification and his commission , been refused admission , to exercise thereunder his spiritual and canonical profession , and having in vain appealed to the archbishop of Canterbury , as also to the visitors of the college of doctors of law , applying to his grace , and to the said visitors , for an hearing of his case , and for redress of the injury by him sustained , he did carry his suit into the court of king 's bench , and did apply for a rule to shew cause why a mandamus should not issue for his admission : which application was however refused by the said court , for the reason that the petitioner had not been able to shew his right to be admitted to this ecclesiastical office , on any grounds of which that court could take cognizance ; and unable as the petitioner thus was to obtain , in a court of civil jurisdiction , a discussion of his title and of his qualification for this spiritual office , he applied to the archbishop of Canterbury for permission , in a court of spiritual jurisprudence , to plead his case , but with which application for such public hearing it was deemed unadvisable to comply ; and that having been thus excluded from the exercise of his canonical and clerical profession , on the ground of his having formerly taken the orders of a deacon , he has , by the refusal of an hearing to his case , been deprived of the opportunity of shewing , in the first place , that he was duly authorized to divest himself , and did divest himself , of those orders and of his clerical character ; and secondly , that although he were even still a clergyman , he would not thereby be disqualified ; and therefore praying the house , to take his case into consideration , and grant him relief . `` —On
