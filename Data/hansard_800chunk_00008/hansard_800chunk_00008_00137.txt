vindication . He had witnessed its proceedings from 1778 to 1794 , and he would venture to assert that no public assembly ever pursued the substantial interests of the people with more assiduity , ability , and success , than the Irish parliament had done during that period ; nor had any country within the same time , and with the same means , risen to a higher pitch of wealth and prosperity : but whilst , with that energy which real patriotism inspired , the members of the Irish parliament were urging their claims to a free trade , and an independent legislature , the situation of their Catholic fellow subjects was not overlooked , —many , if not all , of the most severe restrictions of the penal code having been repealed.—The noble earl said , this brought him more particularly to the circumstance mentioned by the noble baron . It was true , he observed , that the Irish house of commons , determined to mark , in the strongest manner , their opinion on 790 the application of the Catholics for the extension of the elective franchise , had , in the year 1792 , rejected their petition by a great majority . It was conceived by the members of the Irish house of commons at that time , —gentlemen fully capable of understanding , and thoroughly disposed to pursue , the interests of their country , —that an acquiescence in the prayer of that petition would be productive of consequences the most fatal to the peace and happiness of Ireland . Unfortunately , however , for those who entertained that opinion , an influence prevailed in the British cabinet , sufficiently powerful to counteract it.—The Catholics , having failed in their appeal to their own parliament , sought relief from the hands of the English government . They elected their representatives , they prepared their petition , and the delegates from their body were dispatched to London , and were received by his majesty 's ministers in a manner which , strengthened by the most cordial assurances of support , left no doubt upon their minds , of ultimate success.—Under these circumstances , the alarm and irritation of the Protestant gentlemen of Ireland was indescribable . They were perfectly alive to the danger of acceding to the expectations of the Catholics ; but they felt their confidence in the support of the British government , in the event of a struggle for political power , so far weakened as to render the issue too precarious to be hazarded . They were sensible that something more than deference was due to the authority of the ministers of the empire , upon such a subject ; they saw the necessity of a compromise ; and the act of 1793 , in which they sought to conciliate their Catholic countrymen by the most liberal and . extensive indulgences , was the consequence.—The satisfaction , however , of the Catholics , for the liberality of that act , in which every thing that had been asked by them had been granted , was not of long duration ; the influence which had operated upon the British ministry continued its activity , and a most respectable nobleman ( lord Fitzwilliam ) was sent over to Ireland under impressions respecting the policy to be adopted in that country , the disclosure of which had created the greatest alarm.—Does the noble baron believe that the Protestant gentlemen then considered the rejection of the Catholic bill in 1792 `` a hasty decision ? '' The noble earl said , he could assure him , a very different sentiment prevailed : it was 791 evident that they had gained nothing by all the concessions that had been made , but that on the contrary , they had given power to men who , as might naturally have been expected , were using . it with a view to further acquisition . Much as had been done by the act of 1793 , the state and the parliament had been preserved in the hands of the Protestants.—It required no great sagacity to foresee that the
