from it a number equal to that of the Supplementary militia ; and accordingly , in the spring of 1805 , when the hopes which had been entertained of a large increase of the army from the Additional Force bill were disappointed ; when 500 officers had quitted the militia service ; and when the number of privates was wasting unprofitably , the measure of permitting a proportion of the militia , equal to the supplementary part of it , to enter into the line , was resorted to , but , as it appeared from documents upon the table , with incomplete success . What , however , must be the feelings of officers on seeing a renewal of this measure , not under such circumstances as those which he had just described ; not with a view to foreign expeditions , on which militia regiments could not be employed , but when that species of service was likely to arise , for which they were peculiarly and exclusively calculated , and with a view to which alone the militia was instituted , and could be said to exist ; and when a hope might be indulged by the honourable and high-spirited individuals to whom he had adverted , that they should reap the noblest reward of their exertions and sacrifices in the peril and the glory of defending at the head of those whom they had trained and disciplined , the laws , liberties , and independence of their country ? Under such circumstances , though their loyalty and patriotism would remain unshaken and unabated , their zeal , their ardour , their becoming pride as militia officers , must be checked and subdued ; and if these bills should pass , the life and soul of that valuable and distinguished branch of our military system would , he feared , be extinguished for ever . These reflections were the more painful to him , as he was convinced that the consequences he had described would be unnecessarily produced ; inasmuch as the object immediately in view might be accomplished by another measure , which had been sanctioned by experience 1114 and success ; and to which not only no such objections , but no objections of equal validity , could be justly stated to apply . The description of force to which he adverted , was that which had been called the Army of Reserve ; though , if its services were confined , as he should recommend , to Great Britain and Ireland , it might properly be denominated the militia of the United Kingdom . The success of such a measure might be deemed certain , as in the year 1803 , immediately subsequent to a ballot for 90,000 men for the militia , it produced , within a month after the passing of the bill , 15,000 men ; 25,000 in two months ; and in four months , 37,000 . It would be executed in the same mode , by the same lists , and by the same agency , as the measure of constituting the militia : the appointment of new officers was unnecessary , as the second battalions were now , or might soon be , in a state to receive the men as they were raised . It was marked by fair dealing , as it would be known beforehand that all persons serving in such corps would be encouraged to enter into the army for general service , and that , if they thought proper to do so , they would receive a bounty for that purpose . But it had been stated by the noble baron ( lord Hawkesbury ) , that the process of training such a force would be slow , whereas the men volunteering from the militia would be already in a high state of discipline : the latter part of this proposition was an assumption without proof , and without the possibility of it : for it was not certain that the expected number would be procured at all ; and it was evident that government did not rely upon procuring the full number
