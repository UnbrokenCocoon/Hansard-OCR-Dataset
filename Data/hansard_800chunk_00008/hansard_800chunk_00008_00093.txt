, that some other orders of the day remained undischarged , and he would therefore suggest the withdrawing that motion , and putting a direct negative on the original question . rose at that late hour , not to trouble the house very long ; he would willingly have declined speaking altogether , but what fell from the hon . gentlemen on the other side imperiously demanded some notice . He asserted that the able speech of his hon . friend had not been answered ; the observations of an hon . gent . on the other side ( Mr. Croker ) , professing to be in reply to his hon . friend , he thought contained more of fresh accusations against his majesty 's late ministers , than of reply . The hon . gent . with sense force , undoubtedly , had pressed some points upon the house ; but he must call upon that hon . gent . if he saw real grounds of charge against his majesty 's late ministers , to bring it forward specifically and boldly , and he pledged himself to meet it as specifically and freely . The hon . gent . had deprecated his ( lord Howick 's ) advocation for Ireland , he must say , that not only as a member of the united parliament , but as one privately connected with Ireland by the dearest ties , he was as interested in the welfare of Ireland as the hon . gent . ; and he hoped the hon . gent . would give him credit for saying , that he never had , nor never would speak a syllable , or do an act injurious to Ireland . He considered that part of the empire as the most imperative in its calls for attention and care , and though he could not say that any measure of catholic indulgence should now be brought forward , he would say that good policy called for a general system of conciliation and kindness ; a system which he found the Irish did not very confidently expect from the right hon . the chancellor of the exchequer . The noble lord answered , in much detail , the legal arguments of the right . hon . gent . which he contended were 742 founded on suppositions which the house would not presume . He also adverted very warmly to the accusations made against him , and those who acted with him , by two hon . gentlemen on the other side . To one in particular ( Mr. Milnes ) , he begged to say , that his and his friends conduct , for twelve years preceding his coming into office , which had been so seriously reproached to him by the hon . member from the Sister Kingdom , had had , during all that period , the support and assistance of the father of that hon . gent . ( Mr. Milnes ) ; he would also say , that the young and hon . gent . the son of a man he entirely esteemed , had dealt in assertions more easy to make than to prove . He was anxious to have his conduct examined , but he thought he might at least claim , till it was examined , a suspension of the heavy judgments which the hon . member had passed upon him . The noble lord entered into some details relative to our foreign relations , and concluded with saying , that he should vote for the committee , as timely , useful , and necessary.â€” Mr. Croker , general Stewart , and Mr. Whitbread , each said a few words ; and , Mr. Milnes withdrawing his motion for adjournment , the house divided , when there appeared , For Mr. Whitbread 's motion 136 Against it , 322 Majority against it , 186 Adjourned at four o'clock on Tuesday Morning . List of the Minority . Anstruther , sir J. calcraft , sir Granby Adam , Wm . Campbell , Col . Althorpe , Lord Campbell , col. Abercrombie , hon . J. Craig
