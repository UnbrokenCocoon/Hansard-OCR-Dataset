of the country may often be seriously great , when it is not apparent to vulgar eyes . In the present circumstances of Europe , our danger may be considered as permanent ; for , even if peace should be concluded , we must look to the probability that our enemy will renew the attack , if ever he can take us unawares . In these circumstances , our defensive preparations can not be safely trusted to the desultory efforts of spontaneous zeal : 1133 they ought to be arranged on a permanent system , that shall never relax in its energy , and that wall keep our defensive force in a constant state of efficiency , in peace not-less than in war.—For this reason , were there no other , the volunteer system must-be considered as inadequate to the present necessities of the country ; and it seems to be admitted , even by the warmest advocates of the volunteers , that there is a necessity of devising some establishment of a more permanent nature to replace them . In considering what that establishment ought to be , it becomes us to profit by the experience which has been already obtained ; and that we may steer clear of the errors which have obstructed the utility of the volunteers , it is necessary to examine into the inconveniences , which have actually been observed in that system.—In the first place , the privilege of each individual to quit his corps , though essential to the idea of a volunteer force , is a material obstruction to the perfection of its discipline . The slender tenure open which the officers hold their authority , compels them to humour every caprice of the men under their command : and though a corps , composed of men of education , sensible of the importance of the object for which they are associated , may be induced to pay that zealous attention , which will enable them to acquire a considerable proficiency in military evolutions ; yet it is scarcely possible that the common run of men , place under so precarious an authority , can acquire that steady habit of ready and implicit obedience , which is the most important and perhaps the most difficult lesson , that a soldier has to learn.—Secondly , from the composition of the volunteer corps in general , they are of less efficiency and at the same time of more inconvenience to the business of the country , than corps differently composed might be rendered . Many of the volunteers though not beyond the age proper for military service , are yet so far advanced in life , as neither to have the same facility acquiring new habits , nor to be capable of going through the fatigues and hardships of real service with as little personal suffering as men in the prime of youth . From circumstances too in the original formation of the volunteer establishment , the greatest proportion of the men are above the lower class . To serve in a volunteer corps , requires in most instances a pecuniary sacrifice , sufficient to deter the most numerous class of the people , while , on the other hand , many incidental motives have contributed to induce men in the middle classes of society to enter very generally into this service . In conse- 1134 quence of this , the men who are to be employed in repelling the enemy , are in a very great proportion heads of families , or persons whose superintendance is essential , for the management of various agricultural , manufacturing , and commercial establishments , of more or less extensive scale . These men I have no doubt would fight with spirit , if they were led at once to meet the enemy ; but if their absence from home should be protracted for a long period , the interruption of their domestic concerns might be of material inconvenience . From this cause it is a matter of great and almost insuperable difficulty to bring together a large body of volunteers , or to keep them embodied
