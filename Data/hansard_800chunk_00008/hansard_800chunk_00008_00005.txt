And now , gentlemen , placed in this chair , by the favour of the house , for the fourth time , I have to repeat my humble and heartfelt acknowledgements to you for the highest honour that any of its members can possibly receive . In my endeavours to execute this trust , I must entreat the continual assistance of the house in support of its own honour and authority , and for maintaining order in its proceedings ; assuring you , at the same time , that it is my determination to act , in all matters of business , with the strictest impartiality , and the utmost regularity and dispatch .
