told that no extraordinary efforts were necessary , and that a new system of recruiting , wise , as he admitted , in principle , but confessedly slow in its operation , was the only resource , on which we ought to rely for the augmentation of a force , which , even previous to the late embarkations , did not exceed 168,000 men , and of which , 140,000 , including 78,000 militia , would , he feared , at this time , be an exaggerated estimate . On the policy of sending a large part of our army at this moment , on a foreign expedition , he would , whilst the object of it must be supposed to be generally unknown , refrain from offering any other remark , than that , though offensive operations were undoubtedly , in some cases , the best species of defensive warfare , yet , under such circumstances as the present , it was obviously desirable , that the distance and nature of the service to which the force was to be applied , should not be such , as to render its return , within a short period of time , either hazardous or uncertain . Of the insufficiency of our domestic force at this moment , and even previous to the embarkations alluded to , he trusted that amongst their lordships there was no difference of opinion ; and with a view to the safety of the country , he should rejoice to find , that they were equally convinced of the unfitness , as well as the inadequacy , of the means upon which they were now to decide . The necessity of extraordinary exertions being however assumed , the remaining question , respecting the best mode of acting , under the pressure of such a necessity , could not but be attended with great and peculiar difficulties . It was an undoubted fact , that there was no nation in the world , in which 1111 the disproportion between its population and the demands upon it for military service was so considerable , as Great Britain ; and none , in which the obstacles to the supply of such a demand were so numerous and powerful . The degree of compulsion resorted to for this purpose in most other parts of the world , would be unwarrantable , under a free government , as long as the safety of the state could be otherwise provided for ; and the ordinary inducements to enter into the army , are here counteracted by the strong attractions of the naval service , by the facility of procuring a comfortable subsistence in the various occupations and pursuits of civil life , and ( in case of want of employment ) by the certainty of provision , secured by the humane policy of our laws , and charged upon the landed property of the country . Under such circumstances , it is not to be wondered at , that ordinary inducements have been found inadequate : even the effect of high bounties has been proved to be inconsiderable : local and personal influence has indeed been more productive ; and the consequences of the measures adopted last year , for shortening the necessary duration of military service , and for improving the situation and prospects of the soldier , had been such as to justify sanguine hopes of complete , though gradual success : but still he feared , that , to meet the present emergency , voluntary service ought not to be exclusively relied upon . He therefore concurred with those who were of opinion , that , for this purpose , some species of compulsion must be resorted to , and that , upon the whole , ballot was the most equitable , and least severe : on this point , therefore , his difference with ministers was not upon the principle itself , but upon the mode of applying it . The plan now before their lordships , was to encourage 28,000 men to volunteer into the line from the militia of Great Britain and Ireland , at present
