which it is to last , with the temporary weakness that will precede , and the increasing and endless weakness that will follow it . For it happens whimsically , that the measure now proposed as necessary for the salvation of the country , will be good for that purpose only on the supposition , that the attempt of the enemy shall be made within a certain prescribed period . Should it be a little too soon or a 885 little too late , should we be unable to bespeak the invasion , and to fix it exactly to our own time , all that we shall have been doing will have rendered our situation only so much the worse.—The period of strength will , however , at last arrive , namely , when the men transferred shall have been so settled in their new regiments , as to give to the regular army more strength than the removal of the men shall have taken from the militia , and when our numbers shall , upon the whole , have been increased by the difference of those raised through the medium of ballot beyond what might have been raised in the same time by recruiting . We were to consider the price at which this increase of strength would be purchased , joined with the consideration of the time for which it was likely to last.—He had already observed , that we were to pass to this period of strength through the medium of a period of weakness . He had observed , also , on the lasting evil that would be incurred in consequence of the effects produced on the militia service.—The third head remaining to be considered , was the value of that system of military measures which was adopted last year , and to which we were now about to put an end . Upon the subject of these measures something of a preliminary question had arisen at the time , how far what was proposed was entitled to be called a plan . He for one had always rejected that title , disgusted , as he had been , by the applications which he had seen made of it : Yet he certainly did not mean thereby to admit , that in the best sense of the word , as implying the just distribution of a subject into its proper parts , and a systematic direction of those parts to the common purpose intended , the measures of last year were not as well entitled to that appellation , and indeed a good deal better than any measures that had preceded them ; or , as far as at present appeared , than any that were likely to follow.—The measures , however , of last year , had so far less of a plan , that their pretensions to merit , contrary to what might be the case now , was more in what they un-did , than in any wonder-working powers which they professed to have in themselves.—The army had been , for years , supported by shifts and expedients . It was supplied by means which could not last , and which , while transitory themselves , were continually destroying the resources from which any supply could be expected in future . It had been kept alive by drams and cordials . Its con- 886 stitution , in fact , had been so broken by the experiments which had been tried upon it , and the discipline which it had undergone , it had been so bled and cupped , and blistered and purged , that , when the new Practitioners were called in last year , there remained no hope ( conformably indeed to the opinion which they had often given ) but by discarding medicine altogether , and trying what might be done by nature , when left to operate for herself . If the patient was to be saved , it must be by air and exercise , by diet and regimen , by good and wholesome food , given too in sufficient quantities . The best service to be rendered
