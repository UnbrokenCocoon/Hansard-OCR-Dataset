was so true , that , according to the system of volunteers now proposed , there ought to be no Training act at all . The view entertained upon this subject by the late administration , and which he must contend to be the true one , was , that the volunteer service should be considered as the privilege of those , who were willing and able to contribute by their purses , as well as by their persons , but who did not choose , for whatever reasons , to subject themselves to the compulsion of the Training act . Three classes of persons were supposed : those to whom service in person , in whatever mode , either was , or was considered to be , a burthen , but who were ready to contribute their money ; those who were willing to serve , but who wished to be indulged in the privilege of serving in corps by themselves , and under officers of their own ; those , lastly , who having either not the wish or not the means to purchase one or other of the above exemptions , yet being comprised within time prescribed limits of age and stature , and not included in any special exception , must be content to perform their share , by no means a severe one , of the common duty , upon the terms , which the act had laid down . But it would be the cruellest and most unjust of all proceedings , if persons so circumstanced , were , in addition to their personal service , to be called upon to contribute to the expences of those who were allowed to perform that service , upon terms more agreeable to themselves ; if the poor were thus to be called upon to pay for the privileges of the rich . This must be the case if volunteers were no longer to serve , agreeably to what had been supplied by the acts of last year , at their own expence . The acts of last year had provided , that volunteers already enrolled should be allowed to continue , with the exception only of certain special cases , upon the same rate of allowances , which they had before enjoyed ; but that all who should engage hereafter , instead of being trained under the general act , should serve in corps of their own , with the condition of never being compellable to serve out of those corps , should be required to serve at their own charge . A more just condition could not well be conceived , nor one , in consequence , from which the departure would be more unjust with 897 respect to those on whom such departure must be the means of imposing an additional burthen . The condition was indeed as judicious as it was just : a due provision was thereby made for those distinctions of rank , which in many points it was most important to preserve , and which it would rarely be desirable to confound , even on those points which might seem to regard more the feelings of the individual than the interests of the community . The force thus provided would not only cost the public nothing , —a circumstance that he believed would be found hereafter of some account when the charges should come in upon the system as then established—but would consist precisely of the description of persons , selected as by a rule , whom you would wish to have in it , and be limited to the extent to which alone it would be desirable that it should be carried . No rule could probably be invented which would distinguish with such exactness those whom it would be desirable to collect into volunteer corps , from those who would be left with more advantage to be disposed of by the executive government , ( to be distributed for the most part into the regular and militia regiments , ) than that which resulted from the single condition prescribed by the act , namely , that all persons
