thanks for the steady loyalty and attachment to his person and government , and the zealous devotion to the public service which have characterized all your deliberations , and most especially to thank you for the seasonable exertions which you have enabled him to make for the augmentation of the military force of his kingdom . `` Gentlemen of the House of Commons ; `` His majesty has commanded us to return you his warmest thanks for the supplies which you have granted with so much cheerfulness for the current year ; and when he considers the provision which you have made for those contingent and unforeseen services which the events of the war may render necessary , his majesty has the greatest satisfaction in recognizing the wisdom wherewith , in a time of extraordinary difficulties , you have anticipated 1224 the possible demands which those difficulties may occasion . `` My Lords , and Gentlemen ; `` His majesty commands us to assure you , that he deeply deplores the unfortunate issue of the war upon the continent.—The immense extension of the power and influence of France , and the undisguised determination of the enemy to employ the means and resources of those countries which he possesses or controuls , for the purpose of effecting the ruin of his majesty 's kingdom , undoubtedly present a formidable view of the difficulties and dangers which this country has to encounter.—But his majesty trusts , that the loyal and brave people over whom he reigns are not to be daunted or disheartened , —From the recollection of those difficulties under which his people have successfully struggled , and of those dangers which they have happily surmounted , his majesty derives the consolation of believing , that the same spirit and perseverance which have hitherto remained unbroken will continue to be exerted with unabated vigour and success.—And while his majesty commands us to repeat the assurances of his constant readiness to entertain any proposals which may lead to a secure and honourable peace , he commands us at the same time to express his confidence that his parliament and his people will feel with him , the necessity of persevering in those vigorous efforts which alone can give the character of honour to any negotiations , or the prospect of security or permanency to any peace ; his majesty , therefore , trusts that his parliament and his people will always be ready to support him in every measure which may be necessary to defeat the designs of his enemies against the independence of his majesty 's dominions , and to maintain against any undue pretensions , and against any hostile confederacy , those just rights which his majesty is always desirous to exercise with temper and moderation , but which , as essential to the honour of his crown , and true interests of his people , he is determined never to surrender . `` —A commission for proroguing parliament to Thursday , the 24th of September , was then read .
