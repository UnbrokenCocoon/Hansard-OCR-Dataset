alluded particularly to the fall of Dantzic ) there was no intention on the part of government , at the time of the meeting of parliament , to propose any measures for the augmentation of our military force . 1109 No communication to that effect was contained in the speech from the throne , nor had the subject been at all adverted to by ministers at an early period of the session ; and even now , the plan , which was at length brought forward , appeared to him , he was sorry to declare , ill adapted to our actual situation , and inadequate to the nature and magnitude of the danger . It was chiefly founded upon the expediency of increasing our disposable force , and upon the supposition , that , for a considerable time at least , there was no reason to expect an attack on the coasts of Great Britain or Ireland . Imperfectly informed , as he must necessarily be , he was nevertheless decidedly of opinion , that we could not be justified in acting upon such a supposition ; and that , without losing sight of the expediency of increasing our disposable force , our leading object should be to provide effectually for our domestic security . For this purpose it was necessary , not only to resort to such additional measures , as were adapted to the immediate exigency , but to carry into effect . without further loss of time , the principle of the training act of the year 1803 , which had been altered , but not , as he thought , improved , by an act of last year ; and likewise to found upon the principle of that act , a permanent system , without which , we could not reasonably hope to be rendered completely secure against what ought now to be considered as a permanent danger . It was evident , from what he had said , that whilst he could not agree with ministers in their view of the species and degree of preparation which the crisis demanded , he differed still more from those who were of opinion , that , even at such a moment as the present , we ought to rely entirely and exclusively on the effects of the new , and , as he readily admitted , improved conditions of military service , which had been last year adopted by parliament , but which it was then distinctly acknowledged , were not likely to be attended with rapid success . This opinion surprised him , as coming from persons , not only of great talents and authority , but from persons who had themselves been forward , at an early period of the war , in complaining of the insufficiency of our military , force , for the purpose of domestic security . At the time when this complaint was most vehemently urged , there were in arms in the United Kingdom , between 6 and 700,000 men ; of which number , 182,000 were regulars and militia ( 92,000 of the former description ) , 25,000 sea fencibles , and considerably more than 400,000 1110 volunteers . One of his majesty 's principal secretaries of state ( Mr. Yorke ) had also brought forward measures , which were afterwards interrupted by the change of government , for adding 40,000 men to our disposable force , and he also laid upon the table of the house of commons , a classification and enrolment of 1,800,000 men ; the whole , or any part of which , were liable to be trained and disciplined , and , in the event of invasion , to be required to supply vacancies in regiments of the line , or to be employed for the defence of the country , in any other manner that his majesty should direct . This force , upon which he should abstain from making any observation , was at that time called insufficient : but now , when the danger was enormously increased , by the increased dominion and power of the enemy , we were
