from those now serving in the militia , as there was a clause in the bill , authorizing newly ballotted men and substitutes to enter into the line . But admitting that the whole number should volunteer , and that it should consist entirely of disciplined soldiers , the question was ( and upon this issue he rested his view of the subject ) , whether the superior quality of men entering from time militia over an equal number in the Army of Reserve , was such as , on that account , to render it expedient to suspend during a considerable and most critical period , the efficiency of the whole body of militia , consisting of more than half of our domestic force , and to incur the risk of so wounding the feelings of honourable and high spirited men holding commissions in that service , and of creating such a distaste for it , as to shake and endanger the militia establishment 1115 itself . On this point he entertained no doubt whatever . He thought it obviously preferable to leave the militia entire and undisturbed , in its present high state of discipline , and instead of raising the men wanted at this time , by a circuitous , and , as it appeared to him , most objectionable process , to resort to a mode direct and certain , which bad been successfully tried under circumstances from which the present only differed in this respect , that the difficulty of carrying it into effect was then much greater , and the necessity of it considerably less . His lordship further stated it to be his opinion , that it would be desirable at this time to raise ten or twelve battalions upon a plan which had been successfully resorted to , upon a limited scale , in the year 1804 , and which , but for the change of government , would have been carried to a greater extent . The plan to which he alluded , was that of trying the effect of personal and local influence , for the purpose of raising men for one step of rank : it differed materially from a measure adopted at an early period of the last war , as at that time almost any person might have acquired for the stipulated number of men , any military rank below that of colonel . By the measure he was now recommending , no individual would gain a step in the army , whose character was not free from imputation , and who was not of standing sufficient to allow him to obtain promotion by purchase . To this proposition he knew there were objections , but he had heard of none that appeared to him to be of sufficient weight to justify the rejection of it , under such circumstances as the present : as far as it went , it would lessen the number to be raised by ballot , which , he admitted , was a process not to be resorted to , except under the pressure of an urgent and overruling necessity.â€”The noble viscount then proceeded to take a detailed view of the military establishment of the country , and expressed his decided opinion , that , as lord Hawkesbury had also observed , it must unavoidably consist of diversified materials , and of different descriptions of force ; and that the necessity of compulsion could only be diminished by resorting to various methods , for the purpose of drawing from a disproportionate population as much military efficiency as could be obtained , consistently with the inclinations , the habits , and occupations of the people . The regular army must unquestionably be considered as the foundation , and , as it had been called by the noble baron , the substratum of the 1116 whole : for the supply of it , great confidence might , he thought , be justly placed in the measure adopted last year , for altering the conditions of military service : the benefits of this system could only be progressive ; but they were already sufficient to
