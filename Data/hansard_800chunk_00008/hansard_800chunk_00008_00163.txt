Dundas moved , that the order of the house of the 24th of Nov. 1699 , `` That the chairman of the Committee for any Private bill do not sit thereupon , without a week 's public notice thereof set up 830 in the lobby , '' and which was , upon the 15th of Feb. 1700 , declared to be a standing Order , be read : and the same being read , it was ordered , That a committee be appointed to take the same into consideration , for the purpose of enabling the chairman , in all cases where the house has given power to the committee , to send for persons , papers , and records , to issue an order accordingly , so that such persons , papers , and records may be had in readiness for the committee to proceed upon at the expiration of the week 's notice ; and that they do report the same , with their opinion thereupon , to the house . pursuant to notice , rose to call the attention of the house to a circumstance , which was not only a violation of law , but a high breach of the privileges of that house .
