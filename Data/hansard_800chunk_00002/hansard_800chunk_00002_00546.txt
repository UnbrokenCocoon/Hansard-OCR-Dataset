adoption of the measures prayed for in the petition before the house , indispensable necessary as I may think them for the welfare of the British empire in general , and of Ireland in particular . The abolition of the catholic hierarchy in Ireland has been called for , as necessary to the tranquillity of that country ; but I so totally differ from the noble and learned lord , that instead of abolishing it , I would render it the means of reconciling to the state and to the constitution the great mass of catholic population . I see no reason why the bishops should not be placed under the protection of government , and why king , and paid by the public . By such means , and not by the absurd proposition of converting the Irish catholics to the established religion , by translating the bible into Irish , may we hope to see them good and loyal subjects , especially if the whole system of policy by which tat unhappy country has been governed , should be reversed ; and that , instead of keeping the people in ignorance and barbarism , a liberal and well-digested system of instruction should be adopted , and encouragement afforded to habits of industry , and respect for the laws . —My lords ; having expressed a decided opinion respecting the petition of the Irish Roman catholics on its first introduction into this house , I have purposely waited to this late period of the debate , that I might learn the sentiments of other noble lords . The discussion is now so exhausted , that I can compress what I have to submit to your lordships within narrower limits than I should have thought right if I had spoken earlier . My noble 823 friend who presented the petition , has stated , that it involves the interests and happiness of four millions of people : —my noble friend might have said , that it involves the interests and happiness of the whole British empire . In agitating a question of such extent and magnitude , I am desirous to use a guarded and conciliatory language ; but I must not be expected to sacrifice truth and fair argument at the shrine of flattery ; not will I be induced to withhold or extenuate any just reasonings that may present themselves to my mind . I see nothing improper or disrespectful in the style and temper of the petition ; nor , indeed , was it to be supposed that individuals making a great request , would express themselves in repulsive and offensive terms . I have not , however , adverted to the wording of the petition so much as to its purport and objects ; and it is well worthy of remark , that the whole bears a strong resemblance to the memorable declaration of James the Second , in 1687 , for the liberty of conscience . The are in both instruments the same plausible professions of anxiety to conciliate and unite all religious persuasions , the same gracious promises to respect the property of the established church , the same appeals from the interests of trade , which always vibrate forcibly on a British ear , the same display of a generous earnestness to open every avenue of legalized ambition , — and all this as a prologue to the demand of a full and equal participation of power , and of the means of acquiring power . Your lordships will recollect , that this declaration was soon followed by another , which notified that papists had been appointed to all the principal offices of the state ; and recommended to the people to send papist representatives to the new parliament.—From the epoch of that inauspicious precedent in 1687 , to the æra of French fraternity and Irish rebellion in 1798 , the notions of an equality of political power had been suffered to lie dormant . During the greater part of that long period , the Irish catholics had been subjected to a system of intolerance and restraints much too severe to be defended
