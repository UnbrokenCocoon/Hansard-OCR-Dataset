at Dublin , in the year 1689 , by king James II . after his abdication , and by him honoured with the title of a parliament , in proof of his assertions ; it consisted almost entirely of romanists , unlawful elected , after he had destroyed all the corporations , and driven out of the country , or into the protestant armies , almost the whole of the protestant nobility and gentry ; and after he had himself ceased to be a king , and had therefore no power to convoke a parliament . By act of parliament in the reign of William and Mary , this mock parliament was declared to be unlawful assembly , and all its acts and proceedings were condemned to the flames , and were publicly burned and destroyed accordingly.—I trust l have demonstrated to the house , that the doctrines , political , moral , and religious , contained in the petition , and stated to be the principles inculcated by the Roman catholic religion , are diametrically opposite to the principles taught and inculcated by the canons , decrees of general councils , by all writers , lay and cleric , of the greatest authority amongst the romanists , and adopted , by the universal practice of their church from the date of the council of Lateran to the present day ; and that their modern writers , such as Dr . Troy and Mr. Plowden assert , `` that the religious principles of Roman catholics being unchangeable , they are applicable to all times ; and that if any one says , or pretends to insinuate , that the modern Roman catholics differ in one iota from their ancestors , he either deceives himself or wishes to deceive others ; and that semper endem is emphatically descriptive of their religion . `` —It has been urged in this debate , that the establishment by the British government of the Roman catholic religion in Canada , furnishes a reason for establishing it in the remainder of the British empire , because it has not been productive of any bad effects there . It is rather premature to form any decided opinion of what effects may hereafter flow from such establishment ; but even supposing that the effects of such establishment may hereafter be found to be pre- 914 judicial to the British government there , yet the establishment of it in Canada was a matter of necessity and not of choice ; for Canada surrendered to the British arms upon express stipulated conditions ; one of which was , that the Roman catholic religion , which was professed by that country before the conquest by the British arms , should be for ever preserved inviolate ; and Britain ever faithful to her treaties , was thus obliged to establish the Roman catholic religion in that province . As to the fidelity of the Canadians during the American war , it may be accounted for also by necessity on their side : their communication with Europe is by the river St. Lawrence , which is open to navigation for six months in the year only ; for the other six months it is blockaded by ice . Britain , in case of rebellion of the Canadians , could cut off all communication with Europe by a few ships stationed in the river St. Lawrence ; and the Canadians can not at present subsist without European commodities , and with these they could not be furnished from the United States without great difficulty and intolerable expense , besides infinite risk and hazard.—The hon . member who has introduced this motion , has argued in favour of the motion from the number of romanists in Ireland ; and , to strengthen his argument , he has represented them , in the course of his speech , sometimes to amount to four millions , sometimes to three millions ; but in the whole course of his reasoning he has never mentioned the Irish protestants , but has endeavoured to impress on the members of this house , unacquainted with Ireland , that all its inhabitants
