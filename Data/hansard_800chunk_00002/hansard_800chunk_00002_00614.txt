and power , from the supremacy in spirituals ; their adhesion is indissoluble , they must for ever accompany each other.â€”It is now time to advert to the principal argument in the pamphlet , that the . ; king is not by his coronation oath bound to resist the adoption of the present measure : this the author rests on the clause in that oath , which binds his majesty `` to govern the people according to the states in parliament agreed on , and the laws and customs of the realm . ' The author then gives a mutilated extract from the next clause , to wit , that his majesty swears `` to maintain the protestant reformed religion established by law ; '' [ for coronation oath , as settled by the act of 1st William and Mary , see Black- 905 stone 's Commentaries octavo edit 1st vol . page 228 , 229 ] , and adverts only to the coronation oath as settled by the 1st of William and Mary , without at all adverting to the additions made to that oath by 5th of Anne , or the act of union between England and Scotland . He then draw , the following conclusion from these garbled premises , that the last clause can only mean the protestant reformed religion , as from time to time , under the legislation of parliament , it should be the church establishment of the country : that , as to the constitutional interpretation of the clause , it would be absurd in the extreme , unconstitutional , and perhaps even treasonable , to contend that the last clause precludes his majesty from concurring with both houses of parliament in any legislative act whatsoever ; and even if it did preclude him from such a concurrence , it would be no objection to his repealing the laws remaining in force against the Irish romanists , as the repeal of them will not interfere with the legal establishment of the church , with any part of the hierarchy or spiritual rights and privileges . I have already remarked the disingenuity of the author of the pamphlet in respect to his garbled quotations of the coronation oath , and his total omission of the additions made to it , by the act of union of England and Scotland , by which the king is obliged to swear at coronation , to maintain and preserve inviolably the church of England , the act of uniformity , and all acts in force at the time of that union , for the perpetual preservation of the church of England in its doctrine , worship , discipline , and government ( the act already mentioned of the 30th of Charles II . among the rest , whereby all members of both houses of parliament are bound to take the oaths previous to their sitting or voting in the houses ) , as it stood at the time of the union of England and Scotland , and consequently not to make or consent to the making any alteration in its doctrine , discipline and government , as it then stood . But the first deduction of the author from the clauses in the coronation oath , as partially quoted by him , that they can only mean , the protestant reformed religion , as from time to time , under the legislation of parliament , it should be the church establishment of the country , is founded on a sophism , to wit , the fraudulent assumption , that bills depending in parliament , and which have , perhaps , passed the two houses , are acts of parliament or statutes . The king , by his 906 coronation oath , is bound to govern his people according to the statutes in parliament agreed on ( that is , agreed on by king , lords , and commons , the king in his legislative capacity being an integral part of the parliament ) , but not according to bills depending in parliament , and which may perhaps have been agreed on by a majority of the members
