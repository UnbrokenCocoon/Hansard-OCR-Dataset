but consider as one of the most extraordinary speeches that has ever been uttered in parliament . Considering both the arguments used and the person who has used them , it certainly merits all the reprobation which it has receive . I have , how ever , the greatest satisfaction in congratulating the house on the very different tone which has in general prevailed , and espe- 818 cially in the two last speeches on the other side ( the bishop of St. Asaph and lord Ellenborough ) . the reverend and learned prelate , in particular , had expressed himself in a manner , which does him the highest honour ; and the only ground of surprise is , the circumstance of the reverend prelate 's appearing to be influenced by those extraordinary arguments and assertions which have been contradicted as unfounded , by noble lords best acquainted with the state of Ireland . The reverend prelate appears to have received from that learned lord some new lights with respect to the catholic religion , which have induced him to change his opinion as to the propriety of removing the political disabilities , according to the prayer of the petition , which he at first imagined might be granted without endangering the established church or the protestant succession . For myself , I can assure the house , that if I could be persuaded either the one or the other would be in any degree affected by the concessions prayed for I would be the first man in the house to oppose them ; but , according to my view of the subject , so far from having this fear , I am firmly persuaded that this measure of conciliation would produce a directly contrary effect , and , by uniting all the hearts of his majesty 's subjects , would afford the firmest security to our establishment both in church and state : not indeed , if these remaining concessions are made in the same spirit , and in the same ungracious manner as those which have formerly taken place in Ireland ; but if they are granted ( as I trust and ampersuaded they sooner or later will ) in the true spirit of conciliation and peace . And this leads me to advert to the history of Ireland with reference to this question , which has been dwelt on with so much self-complacency by a noble earl opposite to me ( Westmorland ) who administered the affairs of that country at the period of the last concessions to the catholics . The period of the revolution has been dwelt on by many who have spoken in the debate with satisfaction ; and I am as ready any man to do ample justice to that great æra of the establishment of the civil and religious liberties which we now enjoy—the catholics or Ireland must , however , date from thence the extinction of their liberties , and the commencement of those sufferings which they have borne with such exemplary patience , and repaid with such distinguished loyalty . Till the auspicious reign or his present majesty , their situation was that or 819 the most abject slavery ; and they were a proscribed race in their native land , compelled to submit to the most harsh and degrading system of laws that perhaps ever was framed . The policy of this system I do not arraign , severe and cruel as it was ; it might , in some degree , perhaps , have been justified by political necessity ; and I mention it only with a view to do justice to the exemplary conduct of the catholics under such circumstances . During the rebellion of 1745 , when lord Chesterfield was lord lieutenant , their loyalty and attachment were conspicuously manifested in favour of the protestant king on the throne , against the popish successor of him who had been expelled on account of his attachment to their cause . Again , in 1759 , when a French armament was ready to invade Ireland , for the express purpose of restoring the exiled family , and
