that princes excommunicated by the pope may be deposed or murdered by their subjects ; renounces the temporal jurisdiction of the pope , and declares that it is taken without equivocation , in the ordinary sense of the words.—The oath of 1793 goes much further , and renounces the infallibility of the pope ; the power of the priest to give absolution unconditionally ; the intention of subverting the present church establishment , and substituting a Romish establishment in its stead ; of overturning the present arrangement of property in Ireland , and of using the power and privileges demanded by the romanists to weaken the protestant religion and protestant government in Ireland ; and , so far as it relates merely to religious principles , is the same oath which was drawn up and prepared by a committee of English romanists in the year 1790 , to be offered to the then English ministry as a proper oath to be tendered to all English romanists ; and they taking thereof to be sanctioned by an act of parliament . This oath three out of the four apostolic vicars , the special agents and emissaries of the pope in England , reprobated and anathematized by an encyclical letter , dated London , Jan. 12 , 1791 , and commanded all the English romanists to reject this oath , and stated in their letter that they thus acted with the approbation of the apostolic see , and of all the romish bishops in Scotland and in Ireland . These apostolic vicars had so much influence with the English ministry in 1791 , that they prevailed upon them to omit from the oath by statute prescribed to be taken by the English romanists , the abjuration of the pope 's infallibility , and of the doctrine of unconditional power of absolution in the priest . It is also to be remarked , that all the professors and members of the college of Manooth in Ireland are by an Irish statute exempted from the obligation of taking the oath of 1793 . This is a college founded by government for the education of Romish priests.—From what I have mentioned , I conceive ; 869 that the petition 's containing a declaration against the pope 's infallibility , and the doctrine of unconditional power of absolution in the romish priesthood , is the reason why no romish ecclesiastic has subscribed it.—The petition prays that all statutes now in force against romanists ( that is , all statutes requiring them to take tests as qualifications for offices and seats in parliament ) may be repealed , and they may be restored to the full enjoyment of the benefits of the British constitution , equally and in common with their fellow-subjects throughout the British empire : —this they claim as matter of justice and public utility . It is very remarkable , that this measure thus demanded upon the grounds of justice and public utility , is the very measure which King James II . attempted to force upon the nation , and for which attempt he forfeited the crown handed down to him by a long and illustrious line of ancestors ; and that the reasons given by him for his attempt are the very same reasons pleaded by the petitioners and their advocates for the justice of their demand ; to wit , `` that it would cause and promote a brotherhood of affections and a conciliation of religious differences ; '' — `` to render the nation happy at home , and formidable to foreign nations . `` —See his declaration for general liberty of conscience , the letter left upon his table previous to his flight to France , and his speech to his pretended popish parliament in Ireland after his abdication . If his attempt was just , and the measure for the public benefit , it follows that he was unjustly dethroned ; and the direct consequence of that is , that his present majesty 's title to the throne is an unjust one . Let this house determine whether such doctrine is or is not consistent with loyalty.—I shall
