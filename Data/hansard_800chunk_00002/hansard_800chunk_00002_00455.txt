all the passions , the prejudices , and the interest of the people would be naturally and easily embarked against you . Believe me , the laws you are desired to repeal , are the outworks of your church establishment . As long as they are preserved , the establishment itself can not and will not be assailed . Struggle , therefore , for them to the last ; and remember that if you are there defeated , the contest is not at an end ; you will only change the scene of action , and have to resists the enemy in a situation where his power of attack will be more formidable , and your means of defence much more difficult . The expectation that concessions , as such should lead to peace , is unfortunately contrary to the experience we have had in the history of Ireland . No man can lament , in itself , more than I do , the greater part of the penal code which was enacted against the catholics in the reign of queen Anne : but there is one singular circumstance attendant upon the enactment of that code , and which deserves peculiar attention , â€”Though Ireland , from its first conquest to that period , had , with very small interuptions , been the theatre of rebellion and insurrection , yet from the time of the adoption of that code to the period of its repeal , 687 during a long series of years , notwithstanding there was a new family upon the throne , possessing a disputed title to the crown ; notwithstanding two formidable rebellions in Great-Britain , Ireland remained in a state of repose and tranquillity ; it was not till after the policy of concession had been adopted , that disaffection , insurrection , and , ultimately , rebellion , made again their appearance that country . As I never could have approved of the principle of that code , I rejoice at its repeal : but though I approve of the repeal in substance , I doubt very much the wisdom and policy of the mode in which many parts of that repeal were effect ; it does not appear to have been effected on any great and consistent system of policy by which the whole state of Ireland was brought under the consideration of government , and future dangers thereby foreseen and provided against , at the time that ancient grievances were removed : but concession seems to have been too often made to clamour , for the purpose of averting the danger of the moment ; such concession , led naturally to new demands ; such demands , have on some occasions been precipitately complied with ; and the consequence has been , that discontent has been fostered and encouraged , and some inconsistencies have be a introduced into the laws of that country , which it is impossible not to regret . Viewing the subject in this light , I can not agree with the noble baron in attributing so much political wisdom to the gradual manner in which , this instance , these concessions have been made : on the contrary , I discover no small inconvenience and mischief in the very circumstance which is the object of his commendation ; I believe that the tranquillity of Ireland would have been better consulted , if , instead of the temporary expedients just described , a mature and steady view had been taken of the whole of its condition ; if it had been deliberately enquired , what concessions might have been made without much hazard , and what ought to have been for ever refused : this being ascertained , it would have been the part of a liberal and enlightened policy to grant whatever the safety of the state would have permitted : and there would have been this convenience in such a proceeding , the deliberation with which the concessions would have been made , would have sanctioned the concession themselves . At the same time it would have been a bar to further demands , and we should have
