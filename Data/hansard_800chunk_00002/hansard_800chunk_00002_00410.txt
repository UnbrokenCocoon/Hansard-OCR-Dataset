the poor and all virtue to the rich ; he therefore objected to it , on the ground of unseemliness . He thought the election law of the two countries should be assimilated as nearly as possible , and this subject should not be taken up on such light and flippant grounds as it had been . He thought a committee should be appointed to take the matter into consideration . said there was no duty on freeholders , except on leases , and that was necessary , in order to ascertain the right to the freehold . thought he saw several objections as to the traverse and other points , but these might be modified , altered , or done away in the committee . said a few words in favour of the bill going to a committee . After which the bill was read a second time , and ordered to be committed on Thursday . â€”A petition of several freeholders of the county of Bedford , was presented to the house and read ; setting forth , `` that the petitioners unite with their constituents at large in thanking the house for their resolutions of the 8th and 10th of April , founded on the tenth report of the commissioners of naval enquiry : by the first of those resolutions the house vindicated the character of their country , by censuring a minister proved to have been guilty of a gross violation of law , and a flagrant breach of duty ; by the second , the house laid before the sovereign the sense of his people , and enabled him , by a ready compliance with their wishes , to endear himself more than ever to their loyal and affectionate hearts ; and the petitioners implore the house steadily to persevere in detecting all other abuses which are pointed at , as well in the tenth as in the eleventh report of the said commissioners , attentively to investigate all irregularities which may be brought to light by any of their succeeding reports , impartially , minutely , and resolutely to examine into the public expenditure in all the 620 other branches of administration , and to inflict exemplary punishment on all who shall be found guilty of , or in any wise aiding , abetting , or conniving at similar frauds and depredations ; and that the petitioners are thoroughly persuaded that it is needless for them to urge any fresh motive to the house in order to induce them to adopt such measures ; they rely upon the knowledge the house have of their duties , and upon their sympathy and fellow feeling with their constituents , who , during a long , a difficult , and trying period of war , in times of severe hardships and scarcity , have chearfully submitted to the heaviest burthens ; that what they granted liberally should be applied honestly was the least the petitioners could hope from men whose consciences and bounden duty enjoined a faithful discharge of the great trust reposed in them . Disappointed of this hope , and finding on the contrary that a minister filling many great and lucrative offices , high in the confidence of his sovereign , one of the foremost in his pretended efforts to reform abuses , has been at length himself detected in conniving for a series of years at the foulest peculation ; the petitioners now approach the house with their claims to protection and justice ; and they trust , therefore , that in prosecuting the inquiries necessary for these ends , the house will proceed in that spirit of firmness and integrity which dictated the resolutions of the 8th and 10th of April ; and that they will not trust this great cause out of their own hands , nor again suffer themselves to be deceived by the plausible promises of men who openly violate the laws of the legislature , and hold in defiance and contempt the wholesome guards they enact against the possible malversations of office ; and that the petitioners also trust that the example of the past will act upon
