in very few of the towns or boroughs entitled to representation in parliament is confined to the members of the corporation only ; and romanists , by the aforesaid Irish act of 1793 , are entitled to become members of corporations . The Irish romanists are in the proportion of about two to one to the Irish protestants general ; and the proportion among the peasantry of Ireland is greater in favour of the romanists , than among the other classes of society . The landed estates in Ireland , in the possession of protestants and romanists , are in the proportion of fifty to one in favour of the protestants : but when the bill in 1793 passed , qualifying romanists to vote for representatives in parliament , the protestant lordlords almost universally changed the tenures of their popish tenants , which before were for terms of years , into freehold leases ; vainly imagining , that they would always retain influence enough with their Romish tenantry to command their votes at elections . Little did they consider the all-ruling authority of Romish bigotry over its votaries , as many of them found to their great disappointment at the general election , which first succeeded the year 1793 . One gentleman of large landed property , and a representative of a county , informed me , that he and his colleague had every reasonable expectation , from their great landed interest in the county , of being returned members for it Without any contest or expense : but a gentleman of very insignificant landed property in 895 the county , unexpectedly declared himself a candidate , and went round to all the Romish chapels , soliciting the votes of romanists in the county , and promising , if elected , to support all their pretensions in parliament . On this occasion the Romish tenants of the gentleman who gave me the information , made freeholders by himself , universally deserted him , and promised their votes to the new candidate ; and the Romish priests through the county so effectually bestirred themselves with their votaries in support of the new candidate , that my friend and his colleague were obliged to give a large sum of money to this adventurer to induce him to abandon the canvass , and thereby to save themselves from the fatigue and expense of a contested election . Certain it is , that the whole body of the Romish peasantry , who by the folly and credulity of their landlords have been made freeholders since the year 1793 , will desert their interest on every election , when told by their priests that it is for the interest of their religion that they should do so . In the last Irish rebellion , the popish peasantry pursued their landlords ( most of them very indulgent to their tenants , and from their attachment to romanists entitled men of liberality ) with the utmost fury and rancour , massacreing them and their families without mercy , when they fell into their hands . Such has been the frenzy of the protestant landlords of Ireland , and their ambition of surpassing each . other in county interest , that they have made almost the whole mass of . the popish peasantry forty-shilling freeholders since the year 1793 ; so that the Romish freeholders of that description exceed in number the protestant freeholders of every description , throughout three parts in four of Ireland : and if this measure shall take effect , romanists will be returned members of parliament for most of the counties at large , counties of towns , and pot-wallopping boroughs throughout Ireland : and the principle of representation in the British constitution , that property should be the basis of representation , will be completely reversed in Ireland , and the basis there will be numbers , not property.â€” But even in respect of property , the influence of popery will be daily advancing in Ireland , because , in a commercial country , land is as often at market , and changes hands , as personal property ; and lauded as
