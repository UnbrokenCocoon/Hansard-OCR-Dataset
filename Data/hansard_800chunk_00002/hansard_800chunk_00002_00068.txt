, and denies the representative franchise to one and the same class of his his majesty 's subjects ; which detaches from property its proportion of political power under a constitution whose vital principle is the union of the one with the other ; which closes every avenue of legalized ambition against those who must be presumed to have great credit and influence among the mass of the population of the country ; which refuses to peers of the realm all share in the legislative representation , either actual or virtual ; and renders the liberal profession of the law to Roman Catholics a mere object of pecuniary traffic , despoiled of its hopes and of its honours . `` Your Petitioners further most humbly shew , that the exclusion of so numerous and efficient a portion of his majesty 's subjects as the Roman Catholics of this realm from civil honours and offices , and from advancement in his majesty 's army and navy , actually impairs , in a very material degree , the most valuable resources Of the British empire , by impeding his majesty 's general service , stifling the most honourable and powerful incentives to civil and military merit , and unnecessarily restricting the exercise of that bright prerogative of the crown , which encourages good subjects to promote the public welfare , and excites them to meritorious actions , by a well regulated distribution of public honours and rewards . `` Your Petitioners beg leave most humbly to submit , that those manifold incapacities , restraints , and privations , are absolutely repugnant to the liberal and comprehensive principles recognized by their most gracious sovereign and the parliament of Ireland : that they are impolitic 102 restraints upon his majesty 's -prerogative—that they are hurtful and vexatious to the feelings of a loyal and generous people—and that the total abolition of them will be found not only compitible with , but highly conduci to , the perfect security of every establishment religious or political , now existing in this realm . `` For your Petitioners most explicitly declare , that they do not seek or wish , in the remotes degree , to injure or encroach upon `` the rights , privileges , immunities , possessions , or revenues appertaining to the bishops and clergy of the protestant religion , as by law established , or to the churches committed to their charge , or to any of them '' —the sole object of your petitioners being an equal participation , upon equal terms with their fellow-subjects , of the full benefits of the British laws and constitution . `` Your Petitioners beg leave most humbly to observe , that although they might well and justly insist upon the firm and unabated loyalty of his majesty 's Roman Catholic subjects to their most gracious sovereign , their profound respect for the legislature , and their dutiful submission to the laws , yet they most especially rest their humble claims and expectations of relief upon the clear and manifest conduciveness of the measure which they solicit to the general and permanent tranquillity , strength and happiness of the British empire . And your Petitioners , entertaining no doubt of its final accomplishment , from its evident justice and utility , do most solemnly assure this hon . house , that their earnest solicitude for it , at this peculiar crisis , arises principally from their anxious desire to extinguish all motives to disunion , and all means of exciting discontent . `` For your Petitioners humbly state it as their decided opinion , that the enemies of the British empire , who meditate the subjugation of Ireland , have no hope of success , save in the disunion of its inhabitants ; and therefore it is , that your Petitioners are deeply anxious , at this moment , that a measure should be accomplished which will annihilate the principles of religious animosity , and animate all descriptions of his majesty 's subjects in an enthusiastic defence of the best constitution that has ever yet been established . `` Your Petitioners , therefore , most humbly
