the Roman catholic clergy , that any proposition for a commutation of tithes ( in , which , as the law stands , they have apparently no interest ) has constantly been treated by them with the strongest terms of reprobation ; evincing by their eagerness to condemn any such measure , that they still consider the tithes as their property , and any proposal for a commutation as affecting their rights . The forfeited estates , including the property of all the , English settlers in the remotest times , including the property of many Roman catholics , were made a great source of discontent , with those of the lower orders , were , or imagined themselves to be , of the ancient septs or tribes , and considered themselves as labouring for others in those fields which had belonged to their ancestors , and to which they conceived they had still an hereditary , indefeasible right . This source of discontent , injurious even to many Roman catholic families of English blood , was industriously kept alive in the memories of the lower orders of Irish descent , and constantly urged by their priests , of whom the greater part were of ancient Irish families or names ; and the claim to the forfeited lands artfully placed by the side of the claim to the ecclesiastical revenues both represented as in the hands of foreign invaders , usurpers of the ancient rights of the Roman catholic clergy and laity . This ground of discontent would long ago have been forgotten , and lost in the minds of the lower orders , if it had not been industriously kept alive by the arts and interests of the clergy.â€”If the formidable hierarchy thus established in Ireland could be abolished , if all hopes of possessing the revenues , the rank , and the powers of the established church , could be extinguished in the minds of the Roman catholic priests , perhaps , concessions might be made to the Roman catholic laity which some degree of safety , at least comparatively with safety . But whilst that hierarchy remained , nothing could be safely yielded . It might 1075 be said , that this was an argument for going into the committee , where measures Might be suggested to effect this purpose , if it ought to be effected . But the change must be effected , not by any legislative provision , but by the Roman catholics themselves : they must place themselves in a situation which may render concessions safe . It must be their own act . Whatever may be the religious establishment of a country , the political power of that country must be in union with that establishment , or it can not be long preserved : and those who are adverse to the establishment , can not , consistently With its security , be admitted to full participation of political power with those who are friendly to it . They have , therefore , no right to complain that they are not admitted to full participation of such political power . In this country , where the establishment of the protestant religion , and the preservation of it by the protestant succession to the crown , are become essential and fundamental articles of the constitution ; where both are also essential and fundamental articles of the treaties of union between the three countries now forming one empire ; those who are adverse to both have no more right to complain of exclusion from political power , than those who are attached , if any such now remain , to the exiled family , maintaining the hereditary , indefeasible right to the throne , and therefore refusing allegiance to the reigning family , and giving their allegiance to another . The ground on which persons without property are excluded from an equal share of political power with persons of property , ( an exclusion which the experience of all countries , in all ages , has found to be necessary for the preservation of any government ) applies directly to the subject .
