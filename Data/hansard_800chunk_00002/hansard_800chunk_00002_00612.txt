and Mary , to be taken by the king at his coronation , has the following clause : `` I will to the utmost of my power maintain the laws of God , the true profession of the Gospel , and the protestant reformed religion established by law . '' By the act of Anne ratifying the union of England and Scotland , as is already stated , it is enacted , `` that two acts of the respective parliaments of England and Scotland , for the unalterable security of their respective church establish- 902 ments therein-recited , shall be perpetual ; and in both of these recited acts , an addition is made to the coronation oath ; and it is enacted , `` that the succeeding kings of Great-Britain shall , at their coronations , swear to maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of the church of England , as specified in that statute , for the unalterable security of the church of England , and the doctrine , worship , discipline , and government thereof , as in that act specified , within the kingdoms of England and Ireland , the dominion of Wales , and the town of Berwick upon Tweed , and the territories thereunto belonging . '' A similar oath is prescribed to be taken at the coronation by all succeeding kings , for the inviolably preservation of the then established religion in Scotland . The Coronation oath not only binds the king to refuse his assent to any alteration in the religions of England , Ireland , and Scotland , as they were established at the time of the union of England and Scotland , but he is equally bound to refuse his assent to any measure , directly tending to the subversion of the religion then established ; and also to discountenance , as far as in him lies , all attempts of that natureâ€”The patrons of this measure , sensible of this impediment , have not been wanting in their endeavours , by sophistical arguments , casuistical distinctions , misrepresentations of some facts , suppression of others , and suggestion of falsehoods , in pamphlets and newspapers , to sap the foundation of this barrier , which they were unable to surmount . One pamphlet of this nature deserves particular notice , inasmuch it is an epitome of all the arguments against the obligation of the coronation oath ; and is launched into the world under the name of a gentleman , whom I understand be a person of some reputation , as a lawyer or conveyances , and of the Roman catholic persuasion . It is entitled , `` A Letter to a Nobleman on the proposed Repeal of the penal Laws which now remain in force against the Irish Roman Catholics , from Charles Butler , Esq . of Lincoln 's Inn , Author of the Notes and Annotations on Coke on Littleton . '' This pamphlet , after stating , that the author is less acquainted with the Irish popery laws than with the English ( which is indeed sufficiently manifested by its contents ) , proceeds to give what it styles an outline of them ; but in truth it is an odious , monstrous , and detestable caricatura of provisions and effects of the Irish popery acts of the 2d and 8th of Queen Aune , 903 The whole scope of these two wise and provident statutes was to prevent romanists from acquiring landed property in Ireland , their antecedent rebellions and barbarous massacres of the protestants of Ireland haying rendered such a prohibition at that time not only expedient , but absolutely necessary . The pamphlet admits , that these acts are new repealed , but the caricatura is inserted by way of ornament to the subsequent argument against the obligation of the obligation oath , the main drift of the pamphlet . The pamphlet then praises the loyalty of the Irish romanists in the course of the war ; and states that five of the directors of the united Irish only one was a romanist ; but it should at the same time have
