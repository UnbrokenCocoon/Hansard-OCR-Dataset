that kingdom , open , popular election , assembled at St. Francis 's Romish chapel , in the city of Dublin . In this assembly the most treasonable speeches , stuffed with the most virulent invectives against the British nation , and the most lavish praises of the French revolution , stigmatizing the war against the French regicides with the epithet of an impious crusade , and exhorting the nation to a separation from Great Britain , were uttered by several of the leading and popular romanists . The assembly entered unanimously into several factious and treasonable resolutions . It was surmised at this assembly , that an union between Great Britain and Ireland was then in the contemplation of government , though no such measure had been announced ; and one of the unanimous resolutions was the following : `` Resolved , that we pledge ourselves , collectively and individually , to resist even our own emancipation , if proposed to be conceded on the ignominious terms of an acquiescence in the fatal measure of an union with Great Britain '' By the unanimous vote of this assembly , consisting of above fifteen hundred men , re- 889 presentatives of all the romanists of Ireland , these resolutions , together with abstracts of the speeches of the principals demagogues among them , were published in most of the factious papers , both in Great Britain and Ireland . Here then is proof positive of the hostile sentiments of the whole mass of Irish romanists , not of any partial body of them , to the measure of and incorporating union of the two nations so late as the year 1795 . â€”Their declarations against the measure did not stop there : in the year 1799 , as soon as an union was proposed by government , a meeting of the romanists of the city of Dublin was convened by their leaders at the Royal Exchange ; at this meeting , a very general one , they entered into violent resolutions against an union , which they published as usual in the factious papers both in England and Ireland . The same line of conduct was pursued in several other parts of Ireland , though this hostility of the Irish romanists to an union was perfectly impotent , the political imbecility of the whole sect , particularly after the suppression of their then recent rebellion , rendering them incapable either of promoting or obstructing the measure ; yet the English government in Ireland condescended to negotiate with the party , and endeavoured to procure signatures of the dregs of the people of that persuasion to papers and addresses in favours of the measure . Several addresses this kind appeared in the government prints ; the names of wretches who could not write their names , appeared as if they were subscribers to such addresses . The very gaols were canvassed to procure subscribers , and multitudes of names appeared , as the names of real subscribers to these addresses , though persons of such names did not exist in the places from which the addresses were stated to have been sent : in short , with all the activity and intrigue of government , no considerable body of romanists throughout the kingdom could be procured publicly to avow their approbation of the measure . It is admitted , that many honest men , and good subjects at this side of the water ( utterly ignorant of the state of Ireland , and of Irish affairs ) have been duped , by the grossest falsehoods and misrepresentations , into on approbation of the measure now in debate ; and that there is a difference of opinion among men of that description respecting it ; but among demagogues , republicans , and infidels , there is no difference of opinion of it . They are unanimous in its support ; and their unanimity 890 on the point should induce all loyal subjects , who have been deluded into an opinion of its utility to the state , to re-examine the grounds of their opinion , and the authenticity of the information on
