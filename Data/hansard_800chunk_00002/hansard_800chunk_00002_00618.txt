thereof , as in that statute specified , within the kingdoms of England and Ireland , and the town of Berwick upon Tweed . '' The statute particularly specifies , that the act uniformity , and all other acts for the perpetual preservation of the church of England ( among which are the aforesaid English act of the 30th of Charles II . enacted for Ireland it the 3d and 4th of William and Mary , and the test and corporation acts ) , shall be unalterable and perpetual . The author was either ignorant of these additions to the coronation oath , or designedly omitted them : if inserted , they would have completely overturned his quibbling argument , the king is not bound by his coronation oath , to resist the repeal of any law for the support of the established church , which was not law at the time the coronation oath was fixed ; for the aforesaid additions were made to the coronation oath by the 5th of Anne , many years subsequent to the 3d and 4th of Wm . and Mary , and also subsequent to the 1st and 2d of Anne ; by which acts , he states that romanists were deprived of their rights seats and votes in the houses of lords and commons in Ireland . He admits also , that the coronation oath refers to that system of law which was in force , when the acts which prescribed it were passed ; that is , that the king can not conscientiously , consent to the repeal of any of the acts for the perpetual security of the established church which had passed previously to the fixing of the coronation oath : that oath was ultimately fixed by the of 5th of Anne ; and therefore of the author 's own shewing , the king can not conscientiously to the repeal of the 3d and 4th of William and Mary , or to that 911 of the 1st and 2d of Anne , so far as they enjoin the taking of the oath of supremacy and the repetition and subscription of the declaration by all members previous to their sitting and voting in either of the houses.â€”The author states , that at the accession of William and Mary , Roman catholic peers had their seats , and voted in the house of lords ; Roman catholic commoners were eligible to the house of commons ; and all civil and military offices were open to Roman catholics . In respect to Roman catholic peers , I am not sufficiently conversant in the journals of the Irish house of lords to ascertain , whether Romish peers were , or were not , excluded from seats or votes in that house , unless they took the oath of supremacy , previous to the 3d and 4th of William and Mary ; they certainly were not so excluded by any Irish statute : but very few such Irish peers could have sat in parliament in Ireland , from the restoration to the 3d and 4th of William and Mary ( excepting in the Romish mob assembled in Dublin by king James II . after his abdication , and by him and themselves styled a parliament ) ; for the Romish peerage in Ireland was not numerous previous to the year 1641 ; and almost the whole of them were attainted as traitors , having joined in that wicked Romish rebellion , and massacre of the Irish protestants , which broke out and commenced in the year 1641 ; and the remainder for their rebellion in 1689 , 1690 , and 1691 . The author displays much artifice in his assertion respecting Romish commoners he states that previous to the accession of William and Mary , and till the 3d and 4th years of their reign , they were eligible to seats in parliament ; they certainly were so , and are so still , and may occupy these seats , and vote in the house of commons , provided they will take the oaths prescribed to be taken , not by them particularly ,
