; producing as it does a distracted allegiance in the same person , acknowledging and living under the temporal power of one sovereign , and bound in faith and morals by the authority of another , claiming to be his spirtual guide and governor , his ecclesiastical sovereign , and in effect , in all matters of supreme conscientious concernment , God 's vicegerent and representative on earth . it is denied that the effect of this authority was at all mischievously felt during the late troubles in Ireland ; and , on the contrary , it is asserted that the rebellion in 1798 was the mere effect of revolutionary principles , fostered , matured , and brought into action by republican leaders , and brought into action by republican leaders , who were not members of the church of Rome.—I admit that the leaders of that rebellion , the Emmetts and O'Connors , were men of elevated views and conceptions , minds too highly raised above the groveling regards and credulity of the vulgar , to be subject to the weakness of this , or indeed of any other description of religious faith whatever.—I will grant , if it shall be so required , that they were superior to all infirmities of this kind , that they were graduates of the highest class in the schools of republican philosophy , by which i mean `` pure , genuine , unadulterated atheism ; '' but the ranks of that army which their treasons brought into the field were not so filled up . The Roman catholic population furnished , as it must , the means , and the priests in many instances , in their own persons , both the inducement and the example of rebellion , by standing 811 forward as officers amongst them in the day of battle , and imposing for some time upon their superstitions and enthusiastic followers the most extravagant fables of their own miraculous exemption from the perils of fire and sword . I admit that their atheist leaders wished at first to give the mischief a republican direction ; but the religious frenzy of the multitude and of their immediate directors soon give it another , as some of the sanguinary and ferocious tragedies which were acted at that period too truly and too fatally testifies . Any person who will take the trouble of referring to the history of that calamitous period , and will afterwards recur to the history of the rebellions of Tyrone and O'Neil , will find the genuine counterparts of each other , and too disgusting a resemblance prevailing between them both , as well in cause as effect . Both followed a period of extreme liberality to the catholics , took place in a season of unsuspecting calm and security , and involved the country in more than the miseries and massacre which are usually attendant upon civil war . We were taught to expect that far other consequences would have followed upon the liberal grants I have already alluded to . We were to have reposed with confidence upon the eternal gratitude of the whole Roman catholic population of Ireland . Nothing , however , of this kind that I recollect , was exhibited in fact , beyond what appeared in a few public addresses of the day ; a small return of mouth honour ; but neither the king or parliament which conferred , nor the immediate patrons of their cause , who induced parliament to consent to confer these benefits upon them , were very long or gratefully remembered . Two of their first and most active patrons in 1778 , had afterwards the unmerited misfortune to fall in the field by the hands of catholic rebels.—Before we proceed to grant more , if more we could grant without a direct surrender of all securities of our protestant church and government , it would well become us to consider how our past liberality and confidence have been requited . But we can not grant more , particularly the boon which is asked of the admission of catholic members into parliament , without putting in
