, and privileges of state , according to their respective abilities : that no member of the state should be curtailed of any of these privilege for any opinions he may entertain or promulge , be they ever so traitorous or hostile to the constitution , unless he attempts by some overt act to carry them into effect ; for that opinion are not objects of laws , but actions only . But though it be admitted that private opinions are not properly the objects of criminal or disqualifying laws without overt acts , are not the dissemination of opinions traitorous and hostile to the constitution , and attempts to proselytize people to such opinion , overt acts , and the objects of penal and restrictive laws in the British empire ? A man may keep destructive poisons in his closet , without becoming obnoxious to the operation of any penal or restrictive law ; 883 but if be publicly vends or administers them , the laws restrain and punish him . It is also fact , that preventive laws in the British empire , the wisest of all laws , do make opinions their objects , and fix disqualifications , not only on the maintainers of opinions , but also on those who may be reasonably suspected of holding certain opinions . For instance , revenue-officers are by act of parliament disabled from voting elections of members of parliament ; and by the place bill , certain classes of placemen and pensioners are disqualified from sitting in parliament ; persons , not possessed of 300l . per annum of landed estate , are disqualified from representing a borough , and those not possessed of 600l . per annum from representing a county , in parliament : on what ground is it that so many persons are curtailed of their privileges ? is it not on the suspicion , that their particular interests will inspire them with opinions adverse to the interests of the state , and that they will vote in conformity with such hostile opinions , if admitted to the enjoyment of such privileges ? Romanists , whose opinions are openly and avowedly hostile to the state , are in a better condition than the already mentioned respectable classes of society : by taking the oaths administered to all the members of the legislative body , they may sit in parliament : not so with the classes mentioned ; they are absolutely and irrevocably excluded.—This doctrine of natural rights , besides what is already mentioned , may receive the following full and decisive answer . Man from his very nature is a gregarious animal ; there is no instance in nature of savage solitary man ; society is necessary for his preservation and the continuance of the human race ; therefore no right can be properly termed a natural right , which is not also a social right ; or , in other words , the rights of society an natural rights : if therefore any man , or class of men , claim privileges as natural rights , utterly inconsistent with the well-being , and even existence of the society , or political state , of which he is a member such claim is to be utterly rejected , as not being properly a claim of a natural right ; or if of a natural right in a solitary state of nature ( such a state being supposed to exist ) , certainly not a claim of right to be admitted by the society of which he is a member ; because it tends directly to the destruction of the society , and all claim of presume right must yield to the paramount claim of real social right , the preservation of the state . A way then with the claim of roman- 884 ists to seats in both houses of parliament as heir natural right ! —It is here fit to remark , that romanists can not derive any support to their exertions and those of their abettors , for the repeal of the acts enjoining the taking of the oath of supremacy , from this
