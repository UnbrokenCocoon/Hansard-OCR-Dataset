on the vicar-general , expressed their contrition for their offence , and their readiness to make any submission in their power . The vicar-general was inexorable , and the offenders were excommunicated for the crime imputed to them , of having been married according to the law of the land . The consequence of the sentence was , that all who should have any communication with these unfortunate victims of a power thus assumed in defiance of the law , were liable to the same censure and the situations in which the men happened to be , making it difficult for their neighbours to avoid all intercourse with them , near two hundred men and women were summoned before the vicar-general , at the distance of twenty miles from their habitations , to answer for this offence . They appeared before him , and by their submission avoided the dreadful sentence of excommunication , but were condemned , as a penance , to a pilgrimage , proceeding from one holy well , or stone , to another , a circuit of thirty miles and as so great an assemblage of people , passing in a body through the country , and performing ceremonies of devotion at the appointed places of their pilgrimage , must excite attention , they were ordered to declare to all who should meet them , that they were sentenced to this penance for having dared to hold communication with persons excommunicated for having been married by a protestant clergyman . The fear Which such proceedings must inspire , and the possibility of obtaining any redress , however oppressive and tyrannical those proceedings may be , was the true source of the extravagant power Which their clergy maintained over the Roman Catholics of Ireland ; a power much greater than was possessed by the clergy in any state in Europe , where the Roman catholic was the established religion of the country ; a power restrained by no law , subject to no control , and utterly inconsistent with the peace , order , and good government of any country ; a power which our ancestors , in times of the greatest bigotry , had dared to restrain by various legislative provision , and history had , applauded their spirit and firmness , and the enlightened minds which had directed their measures . But modern liberality ( with an inconsistency which has no example , but in the extravagance of modern liberality ) has at the same 1069 time joined in that applause , and yet stigmatised as bigotry every attempt to restrain the monstrous proceedings of the Roman catholic clergy of Irelandâ€”an unauthorised hierarchy , lifting themselves up in defiance of the law , and of all constitutional authority . Before the reformation , whilst the clergy established by law were yet considered by the same law as under the spiritual control of the pope , the oppressions of their ecclesiastical courts were in some degree curbed and restrained by law . But now , when the law has rendered the established clergy independent of the see of Rome , and restored to the crown the sovereign authority over the clergy as Well as , the laity , the supreme power over all persons and in all causes , ecclesiastical as well as civil , the only remedy which the Roman Catholics of Ireland , who have unfortunately submitted themselves to the papal power in derogation of the lawful sovereignty of the crown , can have against oppressions which their Roman catholic ancestors successfully resisted by the law of the land , is an appeal to Rome ; and what sort of redress could be obtained by such an appeal , he would leave it to the house to judge . Thus reigning uncontroled , their ecclesiastical courts govern the whole people . They dissolve marriages for causes not allowed by law ; precontract , consanguinity , or affinity , in degrees beyond those prescribed by the legislature ; and they license marriages within those degrees . The evidence of marriage is wholly in their power ; and the legitimacy of children , and the succession
