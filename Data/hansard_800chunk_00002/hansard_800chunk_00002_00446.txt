truth and reason must triumph over the prejudice of any party . then proceeded : I certainly understood the noble lord to have used those terms in the sense which I have affixed to them : but if the noble baron only means that his cause must ultimately triumph by the force of reason and argument , I am equally ready to meet him upon that ground . In opening the business , the noble baron has not thought proper to explain to us distinctly the object of his motion for referring the petition to a committee . From the whole train of his reasoning , however , we can not be at a loss to perceive that he does not propose to confine himself to the partial measure of remedying the complaints of the petitioners ; but that his argument goes to the full extent of repealing and abrogating all the tests at present subsisting in every part of the empire . I trust your lordships are fully sensible of the magnitude and importance of such a proposition ; I trust you will pause before you give any countenance to the first step of a proceeding which may lead to loch alarming consequences . whatever difference of opinion I may entertain as to the merits of this petition , I have deprecated its being brought forward at the present moment : and I have great satisfaction in feeling , that , differing as I do , on this part of the subject , from some persons , whose vote this will be dictated by the some general principles as my own , no efforts have been omitted by me to prevent this question from being 674 agitated under the present circumstances . Similar exertions for the same purpose have been made by my noble friend who is at the head of the government of Ireland : but as all our exertions have proved ineffectual , as the Catholics have been advised to press forward their claims on the attention of parliament at this particular period contrary to their own interests , and , as I think , to a just consideration of what is due to the tranquillity of the empire ; I feel it to be a duty to have no reserve upon the subject . I owe it to the country , to this house , to the petitioners , and to myself , to state distinctly my opinion on every part of this question ; an opinion not hastily formed , but the result of some years ' consideration ; an opinion founded on the most accurate observation , and the most diligent enquiry I have been able to make upon the subject : and though I certainly think the present time peculiarly unfavourable for its agitation ; though I am of opinion that the circumstances growing out of that time , would of themselves furnish a sufficient ground for resisting the proposition of the noble lord ; yet my objection rests not on the time only , but is applicable to any time and to any circumstances under which this subject can be brought forward.â€”In stating this opinion to your lordships , it would be contrary to all the feelings I have ever entertained , and all the sentiments I have ever expressed , if I could be supposed to be influenced by any motives of passion or prejudice towards the individuals who are principally the subject of this night 's debate . In this view , many of the principles laid down by the noble lord would not he applicable to me , or to any of those who act under similar impressions . It has ever been my opinion , that toleration should be extended to all classes of religionists , and to all sectaries . It was a question much agitated about a century ago , by certain speculative writers , whether the evils which would result from the prevalence of infidelity , or from the influence of religious superstition and enthusiasm , would be likely to be the most destructive of the happiness of society ? This question , if ever
