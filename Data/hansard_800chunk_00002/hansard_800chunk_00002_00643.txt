, and to his object . Without a knowledge of the catholic doctrines , and of the influence of those doctrines , the question can not be fairly understood , and that wilful or assumed ignorance of their opinions is unjustifiable in a gentleman agitating such a question . I repeat , that the influence of the Roman catholic clergy in Ireland is now most formidably great ; that in that country , an hierarchy exists unconnected with the 946 crown , but immediately dependant upon the pope ; that there exists in Ireland at this day a most numerous body of Roman catholic clergy devoted to the doctrinal opinions of the church of Rome , and maintaining the spiritual and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of that court . In fact , the papistry is in many points of view more formidable in the present state of Ireland , from the objects on which state of Ireland , from the objects on which it attaches , and the persons it influences , and produces a more uncontrolable power over their people , than even before the reformation . The objects of the first reformers were two-fold : the remedying the avarice , voluptuousness , and power of the clergy ; the abolition of their separate courts of jurisdiction , and all those privileges , exemptions , and distinctions , they claimed or proposed , and which enabled the clergy to cope with princes , and to oppress and insult the people . Princes and people had feelings in common , that led them rapidly to concur in those points with the reformers ; and countries the most catholic , and the most devoted to the see of Rome , limited and curtailed its power and possessions , and wrested from it the supremacy in temporal matters . But matters of doctrine being blended with matters of , faith , and being admitted to be above the comprehension of the lower and middling classes of the people , not being equally apparent upon the qualities of the mind , and the ostensible conduct of those who governed or were governed by them , were not an object of jealousy to princes , or of painful and degrading contrast to the people . The catholic clergy , unequal , therefore , to combat the feelings excited by their luxury and power , seldom attempted to punish , or indeed bring into question , offences against their temporal interests , but accused their antagonists of offences against the fundamental articles of faith , and , with consent of prince and people , inflicted punishments to any extent to which their passions and vengeance led them . The Roman catholic church , now , in Ireland , has all those sources of doctrinal influence over the faith of a bigoted people ; their clergy frequently ( as I admit ) , in the transactions between man and man , exercise them for good purposes ; but they also have the power of giving a direction to the popular mind , with an effect which is inconsistent with the general safety ; and , in corroboration of my opinion , I appeal to their conduct in the late and in former rebellions . In Ireland the British government seems , hitherto , to feel no apparent interest in op- 947 posing the power and encroachments of the Roman catholic clergy ; the people are left totally in their hands ; and from that inattention , their great , and , in this debate , much-boasted influence has arisen : the Roman catholic clergy are now interwoven with the people in all their common transactions of life ; true it is , they can not punish criminals ; but criminals bear no proportion to the number in any state . But I call upon gentlemen to consider , what is the effect of excommunication among the lower orders Irish papists ? â€”It excludes a man from his family , and renders him hateful to it ; drives him from his little tenement , nay , precludes him from earning his livelihood , if dependent upon his labour ;
