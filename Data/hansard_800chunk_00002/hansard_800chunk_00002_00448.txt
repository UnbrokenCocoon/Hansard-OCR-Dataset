their prospective settlement of the constitution , as well as in their remedy of existing grievances , they had the courage and fortitude to consider the situation of the country in all its different contingencies ; they put the question to themselves , whether the inconvenience arising from having a king of a religion different from that which was established in the country , or the evil of breaking in upon the order of succession , were the greater : and , with all their attachment to hereditary monarchy , they determined that it was more expedient to break in upon the line of consequences which might result from having a sovereign of a religion different from having a sovereign of a religion different from that of the country . This law was not founded upon speculative principles , nor decreed from any idea of imaginary grievances ; but was the result of experience , and grew out of the evils which had been actually felt under a king who was of a religion hostile to that which was established in the state . Now , I say , it follows as a necessary consequence of the limitation of the crown to persons of the established religion , that the same principle should apply to the immediate advisers , counsellors , and officers of the crown , —to those who are in some instances actually the delegates of the crown , and who must act in its name and by its authority . There may be shades of opinion as to the extent to which it may be expedient to apply this principle ; but that it is true to a certain extent , and in a certain degree , must appear incontrovertible : for what could be more preposterous than , in a government of 677 law , where the law is above the crown , to compel the king , under the pain of forfelture , to be of the established church , and to allow the ministers , the chancellor , the judges of the land , to be of any religion the most hostile to the establishment ? If we were reasoning ab initio , the converse of this doctrine , I could conceive , might be maintained with much plausibility ; I could understand its being contended , that any infringement upon the line of succession in an hereditary government was so serious an evil , and might be productive of such calamitous consequences , that it might be more expedient to incur the inconvenience of a king of a different religion from the religion of the country , rather than expose ourselves to all the evils which might arise from the possibility of a disputed succession ; and that our security ought therefore to depend not upon the limitation of the crown in this respect , but upon a limitation against all those who hold the principal situations of trust and power under the crown : but it is impossible to conceive how the idea can be ever be entertained , that were the hereditary principle is in question , you will actually violate it , rather than suffer a prince to sit upon the throne , who is of a religion different from that of the state ; and yet , where the hereditary principle does not interfere , nor any other principle which can in any degree be at variance with what is due to the security of the establishment , that you will suffer the servants of the crown to be of a religion the most hostile to that of the state , though their being so must be productive of as many and even more practical inconveniences than could arise from the king himself being in the same situation . The limitation of the crown , therefore , with regard to religion , would seem necessarily to lead to the limitation of the advisers and counsellors of the crown ; and the principle with respect to the first could never be maintained , unless it were likewise extended to the latter.—In point of fact , the history of our constitution
