as well as the civil establishment , would be the certain , and not very remote consequence of such adoption—The author of the pamphlet then puts the following query : `` What system of casuistry made it lawful for his majesty to assent to the repeal of the large proportion of penal laws , repealed by the acts of 1782 , 1788 , and 1793 , and now makes it unlawful for him to assent to the repeal of the small proportion of those laws yet remaining unrepealed ; or , that made it lawful for him to sanction a partial repeal of the test act in 1782 , and makes it unlawful for him to sanction a total repeal of it in 1801 ? To this question it is answered , that the repeal of the parts of the popery code ( which the pamphlet styles penal laws , but which are , in fact , remedial laws only ) at the periods mentioned , does not confer any very considerable portion of political power on the Romish sect even in Ireland ; and the repeal can not be followed by consequences subversive of the constitution in church and state ; and therefore his majesty might give the royal assent to such repeal consistently with the obligations of his coronation oath . The partial repeal of the test act exempts romanists in Ireland from the 908 necessity of taking the oath of supremacy , and receiving the sacrament , on their appointment to places , and becoming members of corporations ; but all places in the department of which the executive power and authority of the state are lodged , and all offices in corporations , are yet reserved and excepted from their grasp , unless they perform the usual requisites of all others his majesty 's subjects on their attainment of such places and offices . The author of the pamphlet is desirous that these reservations and exceptions should be repealed , and styles them a small proportion of the popery code yet remaining : it may be admitted , that they are small in bulk , but very great , indeed , they are in importance . On the continuance and perpetuity of them depend the continuance and perpetuity of the constitution in church and state . Are these matters of trifling moment ? What commandant of a strong and important fortress , the chief defence of a kingdom , would be justified in the surrender of it to a cruel , merciless , and unrelenting enemy , because it was deemed advisable , for the better defence of the place , to slight some weak and unimportant outwork , and permit the foe to possess themselves of it ? —The author , after the preceding train of reasoning , seems to abandon at all for the purpose of introducing one conclusive argument against the obligation of the coronation oath , which he deems irrefragable . `` All this discussion , '' says he , is superfluous ; —the coronation oath was fixed in Ireland by the first of William and Mary ; at that time Roman catholic peers had their seats , and voted in the hose of lords ; Roman catholic commoners were eligible to the house of commons ; and all civil and military offices were open to Roman catholics : they were deprived of these rights by the acts of the 3d and 4th of William and Mary , and the 1st and 2d of queen Anne . Now the coronation oath can only refer to the system of law which was in force when the act which prescribed if was passed ; but the Irish laws meant to be repealed are subsequent to that act ; to these laws therefore , or to any similar laws ; the coronation oath can not be referred . `` —Before I expose the absolute errors in fact in the premises from which the author deduces his conclusion , I will examine the justice of the conclusion , supposing the premises to be true . The coronation oath of the 1st of William and Mary binds
