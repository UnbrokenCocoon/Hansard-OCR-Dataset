28th Henry VIII . chaps . 13 , 19 ; 2d Elizabeth , chap . 1 . ) These preambles recite the great mischief done to this empire , `` by appeals made to the see of Rome in causes testamentary ; causes of matrimony and divorces ; right of tithes ; oblations , and obventions ; by intolerable exactions for bulls , delegacies , and rescripts , in causes of contention ; as well as for dispensations , licenses , and faculties , in an infinite number of cases . `` —Matrimony is held by the Roman catholics to be a sacrament , and the cognizance of in to belong to the spiritual jurisdiction . This , in many eases , would confer a jurisdiction on the pope as surpreme head of the church , of deciding whether a man was the lawful 880 heir of his father , and entitled to his real and personal estate ; and whether a woman was entitled to dower ; with several other temporal concomitants . Excommunication is a matter of spiritual jurisdiction ; and tyranny exercised over the property and other temporal concerns of the laity by the Romish priesthood in Ireland is terrible almost beyond description . Auricular confession and absolution , by giving them the dominion over the consciences of men , confer a mighty power in temporal matters upon them ; and Buonaparté , though a fierce unprincipled tyrant and usurper , was so well convinced that the supremacy in spirituals would essentially contribute to the support and establishment of his temporal power , that he procured himself to be crowned by the pope as supreme head of the church.—In favour of the measure of investing romanists with political power in the British empire , it has been urged , that the doctrine of the supremacy of the pope in spirituals is not attended with any ill consequences at present , and affords no subject of complaint to the temporal power , in any state in Europe , popish or protestant ; though in all popish states , and in many protestant , romanists are admitted into places of power and trust.—The plain answer to this is , that all the popish states in Europe , previous to the anarchical progress of the recent French revolution , were either despotic monarchies , or equally despotic oligarchies , and that the people at large had no political power in theme . The despot , or aristocratic rulers , insignificant in number when compared with the population of the state , possessed the whole political power ; and no person , professing a different religion from that of the state , was permitted to enjoy any political power . The great mass of the people , being excluded from all manner of power or influence in the state , were , what Englishmen term , slaves : and every question which could arise from the claim of papal supremacy in such states , was decided by the despots and the court of Rome.—As these despots were themselves of the Romish persuasion , no controversy could happen between the temporal and spiritual jurisdications , on the score of heresy or difference in religious opinions : the spiritualty could never have occasion to put in execution the tyrannical decrees of the lateran council against the despots themselves ; and these despots actually became the executioners of the judgments of the spiritualty , on such of their enslaved subjects as presumed to question any tenet or the Romish superstition : 881 or they permitted the spiritualty themselves to execute them : in respect to any other points of temporal jurisdiction claimed by the spiritualty , as annexed to the supreme Jurisdiction in spirituals , it became the interest of the despots to acquiesce in part in theme , and thereby to attach the interest of the clergy to their own domination , well knowing that superstition can give strong support to despotic power , by inclining the people to submit to slavery ; and the temporal and ecclesiastical powers found it their mutual interest to unite themselves , to ensure and continue the
