of the least irregularity ; but he might be the willing and active auxiliary of the commissioners , by compelling all those under him to give them whatever information they required . Thus came the right hon . gent . 's commissioners to the execution of . the duties committed to their care , and he had surely no occasion to remind the house under what circumstances the commissioners of naval enquiry entered on their duties . When their appointment was first proposed , it was contended , even by some hon . gent . on his side of the house , that the appointment was unnecessary ; and it was artfully insinuated through the country , that it was not a board of commissioners , but a body of inquisitors , that was about to be established . It was well known , that lord St. Vincent was the person who proposed the establishment of the commission , and no sooner were they appointed than the character of his lordship was on all hands assailed ; various motions were threatened , and one hon . baronet had brought forth a positive charge , though , unfortunately , not one member of the house could be found to second it . Such was the situation of the commissioners almost immediately posterior to their appointment . The house would also bear in mind that the right hon . gent . opposite ( Mr. Pitt ) brought forward a motion positively accusing lord St. Vincent of improper and negligent conduct in the administration of the affairs of the navy . And here it would be easily seen , that the commissioners were placed under very disadvantageous circumstances , considering that the character of him under whose auspices they were to act , was thus directly attacked , on the score of incapacity . To this attack a total change of administration succeeded ; and here again the commissioners had to contend with new difficultiesâ€”they were to carry on their inquiries when all those on whose support and encouragement much reliance was to be placed , were removed from office . Indeed , from the language of the right . hon . gent . on his return to office they had little hope of encouragement . He 565 had then declared that , from all he had seen , and all he had heard , or known , every one his reasons for attacking the administration of the noble lord had . been confirmed , and the commissioners were to act under the impression that the conduct of the noble lord who had established them was peremptorily condemned . With all the difficulties , with all these undeniable disadvantages , they had , however , proceeded with intrepidity , and the public saw what was the result . The grand obstacle in a way of their inquiries was derived from a most extraordinary use to which the fifth clause of the bill under which they acted had been applied . It was quite clear that the commissioners never expected that this clause should be applied to the purposes which their own reports explained , or that even in the office of the treasurer of the navy , which was as it were the flag-ship t all the other offices , they should begin to experience the most serious difficulties in the execution of their duty . What then appeared on the face of their reports ? On the 10th of July they send a precept to the treasurer of the navy ( Mr. Canning ) , requiring the production of certain document essential to the proper prosecution of their inquiries , and receiving no answer , they repeat the precept on the 17th of the same month . The 2d of October arrives , and previous to that period his right hon . friend had given the commissioners no sort of in formation . Was it then to be endured commissioners acting under the authority o the three branches of the legislature should thus be trifled with ? Was any gentleman , however high his influence or extensive his power , to set
