that so far as the present measure would be successful , it was a repeal of the former . Why did not gentlemen call things by their proper names , and say that this was a bill for transforming militia-men into regular soldiers ? Was their system so very changeable , that the recollection of their former measures passed away like visions ; or did they think that they had Performed something like a military manuvre , that they had marched away in silence without the beat of drum , and left only their tents standing , that we might not be aware that the main body had stolen away under cover of the night . They had said , however , that their former measure had not had a fair trial , and accordingly they had more time given for the accomplishing of their object . But now it seemed that it was put off ad Grœcas Calendas , in order to make , way for this new plan . observed , that the right hon . gent . must forego the satisfaction which he seemed to derive from the idea of the bill being a repeal of the former . The operation of that bill was never intended to supply the vacancies that were to be filled up by the present measure . He must also forego the gratification of the confession that the former bill had failed . There was a difference between a total and partial failure . The whole failure that had taken place , and that was admitted , was , that the men had not been procured in so short a time as had been expected . The best proof that it had not failed was that it was producing at the rate . of 9000 men a year for the army . There was no inconsistency here . Because , the former measure was not calculated to produce an immediate disposable force . It was agreed on all hands that it 176 was proper to convert the indisposable into disposable force , as much as possible . He was surprised to hear the right hon . gent . say , that , to obtain the militia for the army , was not an increase of force , when he had been all along contending that the usefulness of troops did not depend on their numbers . Again , the charge of inconsistency lay with those who thought that an immediate reduction should take place , and yet opposed this measure . There might be differences as to the mode , but it was curious to hear those who wished for the reduction of the militia oppose all modes for that purpose . Some were for the gradual , and others for the immediate abolition of the slave trade ; but it would be curious to hear one contend for the abolition , and yet refuse both of these methods . Considering all the objections , he was at a loss to guess to what they would come at last . They objected to different descriptions of force , and required that an exigency should be stated , and then attacked this measure as being a compromise . In a free country , every transaction of this nature necessarily partook of the form of a compromise ; and upon the whole he thought that there was nothing solid in the objections to this measure . was astonished at the bold assertion , that the present bill was not a repeal of the additional force bill . The latter had three objects in view : 1st , to establish a permanent force ; 2d , immediately to augment that force ; 3d , gradually to reduce the militia : and this threefold design appeared in the preamble of the bill , The present bill , in the third , object , by transferring 17,000 men from the militia to the regular force , so far , at least , manifestly repeals the former . Another object was comprised in the former , which was to extinguish ballots . These must be revived by the
