mean not that the Roman catholics of that country should be deprived of the superintendence of bishops ; but their bishops should not be allowed to assume diocesan jurisdiction , in exclusion of our own prelacy , or even co-ordinate with it , nor should they be suffered to domineer , in the manner we are told they do.â€”My lords , if these difficulties stood not in the way , I should be ready to go into a committee ; still I should oppose the prayer of the petition , in the extent to which it goes , for this among other reasons , that I think a compliance with it would be the worst thing that could befal the Roman catholics , as well as ourselves . The immediate effect of it I think would be , to revive that detestable rancour between protestants and Roman catholics , which for so many years has been the disgrace of the western church , but it church , but is dying away if we only let alone what is well . said , the anxiety and alarm which , during the long suspended agitation of this important question , had been excited in his mind as to its probable effect on the peace and tranquillity of the country , had from various indications of the public sentiment respecting it , in a great measure subsided , before the immediate discussion of the question in that house ; and , from the circumstances immediately attending the discussion itself , which ( except 805 during a short and painful in the course of that evening ) had been uniformly temperate and decorous , and such as became the wisdom and gravity parliament , his alarm and anxiety had now wholly ceased .

That the Roman catholics must be convinced that they had a sincere and zealous , as the house was witness that they had a most powerful and consummate , advocate in the person of the noble lord . With a view to the quieting of the question at present , and the preventing its recurrence at any future period , it was well that the defence of the Roman catholic claims had been entrusted upon this occasion to no feebler arm ; what had failed now was not likely to be advanced with equal energy and effect , and with better hopes of success , at any future period . He then said that , in the vote he was about to give upon the question then under consideration , and in the reasons he was about to offer to their lordships ' for that vote , he trusted that no person would be so uncandid as to suppose that he was either an enemy to the full and free toleration of the religious opinions and Worship of his Roman catholic brethren in Ireland in the most extended sense of that word , or averse to those indulgence , in respect of civil rights , which had in a large and liberal measure been afforded them by parliament during the last twenty or twenty-five years of the present reign ; although perhaps he might at the time have paused ta little upon the prudence and expediency of granting some of the particulars that had been granted ; viz . the elective franchise , and a capacity of being included in the commission of the peace ; that he did not repine however at any thing which had been hitherto done in their favour , much
