the 33d of his majesty , which was said to have left the Roman catholic nothing to ask ( and well might the assertion be credited ) ; after the 33d of his majesty , which swept from the Irish statute 777 book almost all the disqualifications of that description of his majesty 's subjects , modelled the oath of allegiance to the taste and scruples of the Roman catholics put down the oath of abjuration , the declaration , the sacramental test , and enabled the Roman catholics to vote at elections , to hold commissions of the peace , to execute offices civil and military , and to enjoy all manner of places of trust and emolument , except such as relate to the established church , and such as are expressly specified in the body of the act : after this long string of statutes , each of which , in its turn , was supposed to comprehend and redress all that was of grievance among them , followed , and in his grace 's view of the question naturally followed , the petition which was then on their lordships ' table . It was for their lordships to determine , in their characters of statesmen and legislators , to what extent these concessions could with safety be carried ; but it was idle to complain of the eagerness with which they were pursued.—The substance of the petition was compressed , for their lordships ' use and convenience , into one short , but pregnant sentence : `` an equal participation on equal terms of the full benefits of the British laws and constitution . '' If the archbishop had been at liberty to understand the sentence according to the ordinary acceptation of the words , he might have answered that such participation was already possessed : but the framers of the petition , who were doubtless the best commentators of their own Work , would not suffer him so to interpret them . Equal participation on equal terms , in their language , signified , admission to places of power and trust , without giving that security for the due discharge of them , which was demanded and given of their lordships , And every other subject of the realm . The object of the petition , couched in very decent and moderate terms , was , nevertheless , of great size and importance . It was no less than a request on the part of the Roman catholic , to legislate for a protestant country ; to dispense the laws , to command the armies and navies , and to take share in the executive councils of a protestant kingdom : a request that struck at the principles of the revolution , and by plain , broad , and inevitable consequence called into question the justice and policy of the act of settlement . Such , in the archbishop 's view of it , was the history , and such the substance , of the petition on their lordships ' table.—The noble baron who , on a former might , moved the question , and who never rose in that house without making 778 deep impression upon it ; the effect of great talents , profound information , and singular perspicuity ; had endeavoured to connect and implicate the substance of the petition with the general principles of toleration.—The archbishop insisted that he was as sincerely attached to the genuine principles of toleration as any one of their lordships . He considered it as the brightest ornament and fairest grace of that reformed church which is established in this kingdom : but that he could not prevail upon himself to confound toleration with equality , much less with power and eventual superiority . It was not a figure of rhetoric , but a plain fact , resting on historical evidence , that toleration is a virtue that grows naturally out of a sense of security , and can not exist for a moment , where danger is apprehended . If their lordships should determine to destroy those fences which the wisdom and experience of their
