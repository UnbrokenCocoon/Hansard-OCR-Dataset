not , in the nature of things , exist equality ; that one must have . ascendency ; and that the ascendency of the Roman catholic ( an intolerant religion ) must finally produce the destruction or expulsion of the protestants , and the separation of Ireland from Great Britain , unless that dreadful conclusion should be prevented by the strength of the protestants of Ireland , and the superior force of Great Britain , in the issue of a bloody and horrible civil war ; he must deprecate the yielding any degree of attention to the proposition made to the house.—The arguments in favour of that proposition attempted to be drawn from the establishment of the presbyterian religion in Scotland , by the stipulation for that purpose in the treaty of union with that country , and the comparison attempted to be made between the situation in England of the presbyterians of Scotland , and the situation in the united empire , and in Ireland particularly , of the Roman catholics of Ireland , if the objects of the petition were obtained , appeared to him utterly unfounded . The presbyterian church of Scotland was the established church of the country ; it possessed all it could possess in Scotland ; it had nothing to claim there ; in England it had nothing to hope . By the treaty of union between England and Scotland , its possessing an establishment was solemnly stipulated for , and secured . It had nothing to fear but from a breach of that stipulation ; and its best security for a performance of that stipulation was its forbearance to interfere with the establishment in England . It therefore remained in quiet obedience to the laws of the united kingdom , and in perfect harmony with the episcopal church established in England , with which it had no ground of contest , and which a regard for its own preservation taught it rather to protect and defend.—It was true , that it the heat of argument , during the agitation of the union with Scotland , apprehensions were suggested of danger to the episcopal church of England by the introduction of members of the presbyterian church of Scotland into the British parliament : and it was true that those apprehensions had proved ill-founded . They were ill-founded , because it must be manifestly the interest of the presbyterian church of Scotland to attempt nothing which could endanger the stipulation ill favour of that church , which must depend , whilst the members of the episcopal church remain the majority , on the good faith to be ob- 1066 served by the members of both churches in maintaining the articles in favour of each . But the terms of the treaty of union , itself had provided amply against the danger thus suggested : for it must be recollected that for all offices in England , and consequently for all the most important offices of the state , the Scotch must qualify themselves according to the law of England , and must therefore conform to the church established there , to obtain any considerable influence in the executive government of the country ; and the extent and power of Scotland , and the number of its inhabitants considered as a part of the whole empire , bore no comparison with the extent , the power , or the population of England , or with the extent , power , or population of Ireland , of which the influence must be strongly felt by the protestant government , if not only the parliament , but all officers of the state ( the access to which was refused to the presbyterians of Scotland at the time of the union with that country ) , should be thrown open to the Roman catholics of all parts of the empire.—That any thing like peace or harmony could subsist in Ireland between the Roman catholics and protestants of that country , if they were placed on an equal footing in political power , whilst the hierarchy of the Roman catholic church there should remain as it stood , must be
