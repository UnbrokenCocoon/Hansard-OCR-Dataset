claims were not objects sought by the two rebellions : had those claims been formerly ceded , they would not have prevented those rebellions ; were they to be now conceded , every motive which led to those rebellions would still exist to conduce to further rebellion . Few of those who were embarked in these rebellions had any interest in establishing the Roman catholic claims . A pamphlet published by a late respectable Roman catholic nobleman suggested that the mass of the people could be little benefited by the adoption of such measure as that which is now proposed , they , being already capable of every thing which their situations could entitle them to , and that probably not more than ten on the part of Ireland could sit in the house of commons of the united empire , nor more than one in the house of peers , nor more than forty , or fifty be candidates for offices of rank , trust , or emolument . Thus the numbers to be gratified by an immediate gift are so few , that the conciliation to be 761 attained must be equally circumscribed ; there being few capacitated to be candidates , the with-holding the objects claimed is felt by few ; there are few to complain of injury , few to acknowledge and be thankful for favours conferred . Hence a concession productive at this day of small conciliation of the Roman catholics , of great dissatisfaction on the part of the protestants , Might lay a foundation , when the political importance of the Roman catholic body became more considerable , for hazarding the safety of the state , and exposing it to the persevering efforts of unremitted zeal , guided by one common principle , and one allruling influence . It may be imagined by some , that though the mass of the Roman catholics have no interest in the objects claimed , it may be proper to concede them , in order to win over those persons of rank and property who have the power of influencing the great body of the Roman catholics . The lower orders have been influenced , not by the respectable and loyal members of the same religious persuasion ( who have an interest in the claims now set pup ) , but by factious demagogues of various persuasions , who aimed at rebellion , not at reform , or catholic claims , and would have been equally active in disseminating rebellion , if any concession had been made short of annihilating the monarchy . It can not he expected that the mass of the lower orders of the Roman catholics Should cease to be actuated by those interested motives which have heretofore influenced their conduct , because of a concession being made to some of the higher orders , of privileges not to be enjoyed by the mass of the people ; in which they have no interest , and by which their conduct has not heretofore been guided . It has been argued , that the influence which the measure under consideration would confer , at present must be small , probably never can be great , and therefore there can not be any danger ; or if any , it must be remote . In the reign of James II both houses of parliament were protestant , yet the other branch of the legislature was succeeding against them both , in the establishment of popery . James II professed to intend for the Roman catholics `` only an equality of privilege ; '' that equality would have occasioned the downfall of the protestant religion : it was therefore resisted . The resistance was ultimately successful ; but the danger having approached too near , the success of the resistance was attended with difficulty and ha- 762 zard . The fluctuation of property in a commercial country , and of the relative numbers of persons composing the several sects , connected with the known perseverance of the Roman catholic body , renders it unsafe to trust to their not being able futurely to do injury because at
