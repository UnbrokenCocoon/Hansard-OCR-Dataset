respect to the third point , the faculty , after professing equal astonishment that such a question should be propounded , do most positively and unequivocally answer , that there is not and that there never has been , amongst the catholics , or in the doctrines of the church of Rome , any law , principle , or tenet which makes it lawful for catholics to break their faith with heretics , or others of a different persuasion from themselves in matters of religion , either in public or private concerns ; and they quote the authority of an illustrious member of their faculty two centuries ago , that such a doctrine is most impious and pestilential , ascribed to the catholics by those men who , rather than peace should be made with them wished to throw every thing into confusion , and thus no harmony , no articles of peace , of equity , or honesty might be received by persons differing from them in religious matters.â€”To the same questions the answers of all the other five universities I have named , are , in effect , precisely the same ; all solemnly and utterly denying and abjuring such abominable tenets . Considering , therefore , the authority of those universities , as to what are or are not the 783 tenets and doctrines of their own religion , infinitely better than of those who ignorantly assert the contrary , unsupported by any authentic proof , I own I can not feel with those who are for rejecting the claims of the catholics to those eligibilities which , it is even alleged , can gain them nothing . In this advanced stage of the Christian religion and of social civilization , I hold it to be highly essential to the happiness , the security , and the prosperity of this united empire , to do away all differences between his majesty 's subjects , founded on distinctions in religion ; and , notwithstanding what has fallen from the right reverend prelate who spoke last , and to whose authority I certainly feel disposed to pay every respect , yet I can not feel with him that there is any danger to the protestant establishment from the vote I shall this night give , in favour of the motion for going into the committee . rose to discuss the subject with temperance and moderation . The noble lord who introduced the subject , had said it was one highly fit to be entertained . If it was so fit to be entertained upon constitutional principles , he sincerely prayed God that it might be entertained ; but if its tendency , as had been ably argued , was to subvert those blessings under that constitution , which not only the protestants of this country , but every other class of his Majesty 's subjects in the country enjoy , both civil and religious , he hoped it would not be entertained . To say the measure never shall pass , would be a language not fit for any man to use who was fit to have a seat in that house . But at present , and in his view of the subject , it was a question inconsistent with the principles of the constitution which had been introduced into this country upon protestant principles ; and , therefore , feeling as he did , that it is a question opposed to what he conceived to be the true principles of that constitution , and the law as it stands , he should feel that he was not doing his duty of he did not oppose it ; and in so doing , he conceived himself acting consistently with that zeal and sense of duty which he hoped would actuate the majority of their lordships , to transmit to out posterity that constitution in as much purity as we had received it from our ancestors . It had been said that the petition was couched in respectful language . He would admit it was . But the question was not , whether the language of the petition was
