participation of privileges with the united church , that even this grant and indulgence , large as it might now appear to us , would be followed by fresh demands and increased importunity . What assurance is there that they would 815 rest contented with this boon ? or would not the broad banners of papal supremacy be immediately unfurled , and the exclusive domination of the Romish church in Ireland be authoritatively claimed on the ground of this very concession , and of that majority in the population of that country , which alone confers the right ( as they contend ) of establishing the protestant religion as the religion of the state in this country ? Compared with the value of this ultimate prize , the objects hitherto obtained in the struggle would be vile and worthless in their estimation . Jam tenet Italiam , tamen ultra pergere tendit Actum inquit nihil est , nisi pœno milite portas Frangimus et media vexillum pone suburrâ . Before it is yet too late , I for one am disposed to rally round the standards , and to preserve the altars , of my country . The palladium of our protestant , and , indeed , of our political security , consists principally in the oath of supremacy , and the tests connected therewith and ( as more particularly concerns Ireland ) in the provisions contained in the 5th article of our recent union with that country , against every attempt to weaken these safeguards of the constitution . I , as long as I live , and am furnished with faculties either of body or mind enabling me to struggle with effect , will manfully struggle , and , as far as in me lies , will avert the mischief which must result from the admission of persons ( owning and yielding , as they do , an imperfect and defalcated allegiance to the state , ) into the entire and perfect rights of completely affianced subjects.—Not being able , my lords , to feel any material degree of evil in the present state of political restraint , as it is necessarily for their good as well as ours , and in the prevention of common calamities affecting us all , applied ; and seeing a sure prospect of enormous and incalculable mischiefs before me , which must immediately result from a change : —as a subject interested in the safety of the crown and kingdom ; as a protestant interested in maintaining the possession of that pure and reformed religion , which having been in times past preserved and sanctified to us by the blood of our ancestors , has been by God 's providence long and firmly established in these realms , and which is inseparably knit together in one system , with all our civil rights and liberties , with our best means of happiness here and our best hopes of happiness hereafter ; I feel it my duty , my lords , now and for ever , as long as the catholic religion shall maintain 816 its ecclesiastical and spiritual union with and dependence upon the see of Rome , to resist to the utmost of my power this and every other proposition which is calculated to produce the undoing and overthrow of all that our fathers have regarded , and ourselves have felt and know to be most venerable and useful in our establishments both in church and state . expressed a wish that the question should be relieved from a great deal of extraneous matter with which it had been encumbered , and that it should be brought to the test of that plain good sense on which he conceived it to rest . He thought the complexion of the present times demanded that every exertion should be made to procure an unanimity of heart and mind in the cause of the country . It was very true that to give the catholics the privilege of admission to the few offices from which they were excluded , would be giving them little ; but the gift would shew a disposition to conciliate and to
