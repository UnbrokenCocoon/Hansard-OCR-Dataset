stock-exchange ? It was impossible for the house to recognize innocence when guilt was professed . When he considered the examination of lord Melville , the letter of lord Melville to the commissioners , and most of all , the extraordinary letter which had been addressed to them subsequent to the report , he was reminded of Cicero 's address to Piso , when after enumerating the various proofs of his misconduct , he breaks off , and exclaims , `` Quis te miserior ? Quis te damnatior . Qui neque scribere ad senatum de te rempublicam bene esse gestam , neque præsens dicere ausus es . `` —If when lord , Melville first , introduced his bill in 1785 , such member of this house had arisen , and addressing his lordship , with something of a prophetic spirit , had said , `` I oppose your bill , and the resolution of the house on which it is founded ; but your labour is vain , your scheme is useless , for 2 years will not have past , before there will be found treasurer of the navy , who will wantonly and successfully violate the bill , and that treasurer . will be yourself : '' with what apparently just indignation would the noble lord have repelled so foul an assertion upon his character ? Yet such was the case . But what should we say ; if such a person had carried his conjectures further , though it was to be hoped with a spirit less prophetic , and said , `` still more useless is your plan , still more vain is your labour ; because , when this violation of law , after having been systematically carried on for 14 years , during which the public expenditure will have doubled or tripled in its amount , shall at last , by a happy coincidence of circumstances come to be discovered , there will be found another house of commons , so different from that in which we sit , so indifferent to the care of the public purse , and so lost to every feeling of public duty , that they will turn away from the discovery , and readily embrace any pretence that is offered to them , to avoid .pronouncing an opinion on an act so gross , so flagrant , so unjustifiable . '' This last conjecture , he trusted , would not receive the same confirmation with the former . It would be fortunate , indeed , for the country , had this commission never been appointed , and these abuses never been discovered , if the result was to be , that these reports were to lay a dead letter on the table , to prove and to proclaim , that although there might exist in 293 this country a minister virtuous enough to institute inquiry , although there might be found persons honest and assiduous in conducting it , there was after and behind all this , a power able and willing to interpose between justice and its object , to step in between the law and the offender against the law and thereby to establish at once the most fatal and the most shameful of all precedents , that of guilt known and acknowledged but not censured , of a breach of the law ascertained but not punished . He trusted , that the event of this night would teach a very different lesson to the world ; that it would shew , that whatever difference might exist amongst us , if indeed there did exist any , on the principles of government , or on the application of those principles to public measures , yet when such questions as these came to be determined , whether the law should or should not be observed , whether the public expenditure should be watched , or should pass unexamined and uncontrolled , there was to be found but one voice , one opinion , and one cause : the cause of men of all descriptions , who pretend to any sort of principle , in opposition to those
