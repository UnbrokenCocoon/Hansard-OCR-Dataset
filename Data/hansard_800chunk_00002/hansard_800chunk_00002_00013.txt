last year . His lordship here stated the number of men who had been discharged from the different yards at various times by the late Board of Admiralty , some of whom were superannuated , and others dismissed for misconduct . He contended that there 20 were a smaller number of men employed in the king 's yards on the 1st March , 1805 , than on the 1st March , 1804 ; the number at the latter period being 9336 , whereas those employed at the commencement of the present month amounted only to 3213 , being 123 less than the establishment at the same period last year . His next motion would be for `` A List of his maj. 's ships which have been ordered to be repaired in the merchants ' yard since 1st June , 1804 . '' He would next move for `` A List of ships of war ordered to be built or contracted for from the above period , up to the present time , specifying the dates of such orders or contracts , and the rate at which such contracts have been made . '' If the workmen in the king 's yards were properly classed , there would be no occasion to build in the merchants ' yards . In the former he understood that at present a 74-gun ship could be built for 211. per ton ; whereas , if he was rightly informed , the contracts lately entered into with the merchant-builders amounted to the enormous sum of 361. per ton . Let the house and the country contrast the difference between those expences , and then they would be enabled to form an idea of the provident management of the persons by whom the naval administration of the country was at present conducted.â€”He would next move for `` An Account of the sums paid by the Navy Board , and to whom , for the Repair of the following Ships in the Merchants ' Yards , in the years expressed against their names , viz . Boston , Maidstone , 1783 ; Southampton , Niger , Lizard , Pearl , 1784 ; Carysfort , 1785 ; Lowestoffe , 1786 ; Boston , 1791 ; Retribution , L'Amiable , Tartar , Success , Ariadne , 1792 ; Magicienne , Dedalus , Andromache , Flora , Fury , Bull-dog , 1793 . The repairs of these 20 ships , he was informed , had cost 298,884l . when they might have been built in the royal yards for a sum not amounting to half that sum . His last motion would be for , `` An Account of the sums for which ships of the same size and force might have been built at the same period , according to the contract prices then paid to the merchant-builders . '' It was not his intention to say any thing at that time upon the comparative merits of the late and present naval administrations . He meant nothing personal to the noble lord at the head of that department ; his object was to institute an enquiry , the result of which he thought would be beneficial to the country , into one of the most important parts of its 21 expenditure . However , he could not avoid observing , that he thought the noble earl near him ( St. Vincent ) who was lately at the bead of that department , was particularly qualified , from his professional knowledge , to discover the abuses which were practised in it . When he was first placed at the head of that board , he set about enquiring into those abuses with an honest and ardent zeal , and having discovered that the most enormous abuses were committed in it , he set about , with a resolution as laudable , the correction and the future prevention of them . For that purpose he proposed the appointment of a commission which had already rendered the most important services to the country , and for the dissolution of which he could discover no one sufficient motive , unless the strange determination
