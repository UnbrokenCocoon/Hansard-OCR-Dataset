as it is a fundamental article of their religion , that no faith is to be kept with heretics ; and that the pope may absolve them from allegiance to a protestant king . Now , my lords , if this were really the case , how can we account for the reluctance of the catholics to take the only oath that stands between them and all they wish ? Is it fair to admit such a charge against them from their enemies , which they have repeatedly , and in the most solemn manner disavowed and abjured ? But , my lords , I will refer to better authority than the assertions of their enemies ; namely , to the authority of the most eminent catholic universities in Europe , for their opinions upon those points , obtained at the special instance of a right honourable gentleman at the head of his majesty 's councils in the year 1789 . I speak of the universities of the Sorbonne , Louvain , Doway , Alcala , Valladolid , and Salamanca ; all of whom solemnly deny such doctrines , and complain of nothing more bitterly than the calumnies of their opponents upon this head . My lords , the question propounded for the answers of those several universities , were three , which I shall read to your lordships : —Has the pope or cardinals , or any body of men , or any individuals of the church of Rome , any civil or political authority , power , jurisdiction , or pre-eminence whatsoever , within the realm of England ? Can the pope or cardinals , or any body of men , or any Individuals of the church of Rome , absolve or dispense with his majesty 's subjects from their oath of allegiance , upon any pretext whatsoever ? Is there any principle in the catholic faith by which catholics are justified in not keeping faith with heretics , or other persons differing from them in religious opinions , in any transactions of a public or private nature ? —My lords , these several queries have been answered by those several universities at considerable length , and decidedly its the negative—The faculty of divinity at Louvain answer , that they are struck with astonishment that such questions should , at the end of this eighteenth century , be proposed to any learned body , by inhabitants of a kingdom that glories in the talents and discernment of its natives . '' The 782 first and second queries they answer unanimously in the negative ; and they do not feel it incumbent on them to enter upon the proofs of the opinions which they hold , supported by the Holy Scriptures and the most eminent writers of their religion , ancient and modern , against the doctrines of Bellarmine , Du Perron , and many others , which they deeply lament , were favourably heard by the court of Rome in the dark ages , and even found its way into the councils of kings , to the production of infinite detriment to the church and republic of christianity , and the deluging of Europe with blood ; they totally and utterly deny that any such power whatever exists in the catholic church , or its members , individually or collectively , pope , cardinal , council , or general assembly , to deprive any sovereign power of its temporal right , possession , government , jurisdiction , or pre-eminence , or subject it to any restraints or modifications ; and that this opinion they hold , as founded in the doctrine of truth , of the apostles , and of the church , delivered down from the fathers and prelates ; and though defaced and obscured by the filth heaped upon it in the middle ages , yet not obliterated . They state that this opinion is not peculiar to themselves , but that there is no society or learned body , nor any one learned man in the whole catholic world , who is not ready to subscribe to it with both hands : and , with
