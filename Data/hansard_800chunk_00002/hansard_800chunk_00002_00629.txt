situation which followed ; inasmuch as they experienced in the then Irish government a more deadly and more active enemy than before they had experienced in the law . I refer to the speeches delivered and published at the time by the ministers and servants of the Irish government , and persisted in and delivered since . There you will see an attack on all the proceedings of the Irish from the time of their address for free trade , such as were glorious as well as those that were intemperate ; without discrimination or moderation : there you will see the Irish ministry engaged in a wretched squabble with the catholic committee , and that catholic committee replying on that ministry , and degrading it more than it had degraded itself ; and you will further perceive the members of that ministry urging their charges against the members of that committee , to disqualify other catholic who were not of the committee , but opposed it : so that by their measures against the one part of the catholics , and their invective against the other , they take care to alienate , as far as in them lay , the whole body . The fact is , the project of conciliation in 1793 , recommendation in the speech from the throne , was defeated by the Irish cabinet , which was at that time on that subject in opposition , and being incensed at the British cabinet for the countenance afforded to the catholics , punished the latter , and sowed those seeds which afterwards , in conjunction with other causes , produced the rebellion—I leave the member , and proceed to discuss the differences now remaining that discriminate his majesty 's subjects of the protestant and catholic persuasion . Before we consider how far we differ , it is necessary to examine how far we agree . We acknowledge the same God , the same Redeemer , the same consequences of redemption , same Bible , and the same Testament . Agreeing in this , we can not , as far as respects religion , quarrel about the remainder , because their merits as christians must in our opinion outweigh their demerits as catholics , and reduce our religious distinctions to a difference about the eucharist , the mass , and 927 the Virgin Mary , matters which may form a difference of opinion , but not a division of interests.—The infidel under these circumstances would consider us as the same religionists , just as the French would consider you , and cut you down , as the same community . See whether we are not agreed a little farther , and united by statute , as well as religion . The preambles of three acts declare the catholics to be loyal subjects ; the act of 1778 declares that they have been so for a series of years ; the same act declares that they should be admitted into the blessing of the constitution ; the act of 1793 goes farther , and admits them into a participation of those blessings . Thus is the principle of identification established by the law of the land , and thus are the catholics by that law proclaimed to be innocent , and the calumniators of the catholics guilty . Let us consider their situation under these laws , professedly and in principle admitted to every thing except seats in parliament , and certain offices of state ; they are , in fact , excluded from every thing under the circumstances of paying for every thing ; the few places they enjoy make no exception ; they pay their proportion to the navy , and contribute one-third to its numbers , and have not a commission : they contribute to the expenses of the army , and to one-third of its numbers , and have not a commission : and shall I now be asked how are the catholics affected by this , or be told that the catholic body would not be served by the removal of this ? How would the protestant body be affected , if
