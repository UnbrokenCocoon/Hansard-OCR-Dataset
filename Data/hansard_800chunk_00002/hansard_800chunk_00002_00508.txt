their intention was to extinguish the monarchy , to put an end to the connexion between Great Britain and Ireland , and in their room to erect a republic without a king , a priest , or a noble . The leaders of that rebellion were certainly too able not to have taken advantage of any circumstance which might have led in the most remote degree to weaken the government , and to render their cause triumphant . They consequently appealed to every bad passion , to every malignant feeling of the human heart . It is impossible that any contest can take place in Ireland , into which , the bitterness and poison of religious and sectarian prejudices will not enter : all men who entertain views inimical to the public peace , would naturally seize every occasion to increase those dissensions . It is to be lamented that these arts sometimes operate on the minds of the low , ignorant , and vulgar part of the catholic community ; but One , can not be at all surprised when we reflect that the protestant , though generally of a higher class , and much better educated and informed , was too often the dupe of these artifices , and suffered his mind to be biassed , his understanding controuled and his generous feelings warped by the existence of those very prejudices of Which he so loudly complained.â€”It is impossible to pass over in silence many things which have fallen from noble lords in this debate , without an endeavour to rescue the character of my country and my countrymen from aspersions which , had they been Uttered in any other place , I should not have hesitated to have called most unfounded calumnies . As long as there was a resident parliament in Ireland , it was the ignoble policy , the wretched practice of the representatives of the people to libel and malign their constituents . I am sorry to see such conduct imitated here . It was the strongest argument in favour of the union , that an appeal was made from . the passions and prejudices of a little country to the temper , the moderation , the cool and deliberate wisdom of a great nation . Miserable indeed is the situation of Ireland , hopeless and without 766 relief are her circumstance , if this her found expectation , her last , her only remaining refuge is to be disappointed ; if by so many sacrifices she has only obtained the dearly bought permission of displaying her miseries on a more extended theatre , where the errors , the misfortunes , the crimes of Ireland are to be re-echoed from one house of parliament to the other , in order to give them publicity to Europe , and that , in future , no foreigner should doubt how weak and vulnerable the empire is in that quarter ! Do not , I beseech you , my lords , believe that the Irish are a nation of degraded beings , insensible to the blessings of law , order , and government . There is neither candour nor justice in estimating the character of a whole people by the standard of the conduct of a few atrocious criminals , by excesses committed in moments of heat , irritation , and civil war . By this mode of reasoning , the whole of the French nation would be made answerable for the infuriate and sanguinary spirit which governed and disgraced for years of the revolution the populace of Paris . The virtues of the inhabitants of Ireland , and they do possess virtues , belong at least to themselves , and are peculiarly their own : their faults are the faults of their situation , and of the calamities which have too often distracted and oppressed their unhappy country . The frequent changes of property during the seventeenth century , the persecuting code of the eighteenth , the marked line of separation between the old inhabitants and the new , have established distinctions which nor time , nor circumstances , nor christian charity , nor political necessity
