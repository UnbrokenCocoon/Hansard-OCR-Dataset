, with a few trifling exceptions , are romanists . To expose the errors of the hon . gentleman in this particular , it is necessary to state , that a calculation of the number of the inhabitants of Ireland was made in the year 1692 , after the revolution war , and that they then amounted to one million two hundred thousand only . Another calculation was made in the year 1731 , as Dr. Burke , Romish titular bishop of Ossory , has informed as , in his Hibernia Dominicana ; and he states , that there were then found to be in Ireland seven hundred thousand four hundred and fifty-three protestants , and one million three hundred and nine thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight romanists ; so that 1731 the romanists of Ireland did hot exceed the protestants in the proportion of two one . Dr. Burke published his book in 1762 , and he makes bitter complaints , that the proportion of 915 the inhabitants of Ireland had increased greatly on the protestant side in the interval between 1731 and 1762 : it may from hence be fairly deduced , that the romanists of Ireland are not , at this day , in the proportion of two to one to the protestants of Ireland . From the best calculations lately made , it appears that the whole inhabitants of Ireland do not now exceed three millions ; and it may be fairly deduced , that one million two hundred thousand of these are protestants , the persons so much contemned by the hon . mover , that when speaking of the inhabitants of Ireland , he does not even condescend to mention them ; and if all the inhabitants of the British islands amount to sixteen millions , then the romanists do not exceed one-eighth part of that population . It is notorious , that the Romish inhabitants of Ireland do not possess one-fortieth part of the real and personal property of that country , nor one-thousandth part of the property of the united kingdom in fact they compose the mo ' and the beggary of Ireland , and are not consequence enough , either in numbers , wealth , or power , to demand ( as this petition does ) the subversion of the constitution in church and state , and the the destruction of the protestants of Ireland , for their gratification—There is an argument advanced in the petition for the grant of the representative franchise to romanists , from the elective franchise being conceded to them in Ireland . I trust that I have already shewn to this house , that the grant of the representative franchise to romanists would be attended by the subversion of the constitution in church and state ; and that therefore their enjoyment of the elective franchise is so far from being an argument for conceding to them the representative franchise , that demand of the representative franchise , grounded upon their enjoyment of the elective franchise , is a strong and powerful argument for depriving them of the elective franchise : because , by their mode of argument , the enjoyment of the elective franchise entitles them to a privilege which would be subversive of the constitution in church and state—It is much safer for a Romish government ; even a popular one , to admit protestants into places of trust and power , than for a protestant government to admit romanists ; because protestants hold no doctrine as a point of faith hostile to the independence of the state of which they are subjects ; but romanists do—The plea that the measure is 916 necessary to reconcile a considerable share of our population to the government is absurd ; for people who maintain , as a point of faith , that the state is subject to a foreign jurisdiction , and is not independent , can never be reconciled to the state till they renounce so anarchical and degrading a tenet ; they must be always enemies to it ; and giving them political power , is furnishing them with the means of overturning the constitution.—The
