oppose the motion for submitting the consideration of this petition to a committee ; and in doing so , I shall enter fully into a discussion of the broad and general question before the house , whether the prayer of this petition should be granted or rejected ; as I think it is a question of the greatest magnitude which has been debated in this house since the revolution.—The petitioners have particularly stated that the principles , religious , moral , and political , set forth in their petition , are expressly inculcated by the religion they profess : it will be therefore incumbent upon me specially to examine the principles taught by their religion , as they are laid down by their own writers ancient and modern , and as they are warranted by the uninterrupted 870 practice of their church for ages . It will , however , be first necessary to examine how and in what manner they are disqualified from enjoying offices and occupying seats in parliament.—The only obstacle at present to the occupation of seats in the two houses of parliament by the members this sect , arises from the laws enjoining the taking of the oath of supremacy , and repeating and signing the declaration againt transubstantiation , & c. by all members of the two houses of parliament , previous to their taking their seats and voting in either house : with which injunction if romanists complied , they would be as capable of occupying seats in parliament as protestants . This injunction they obstinately refuse to obey , and thereby exclude themselves.—If indeed they would offer to take the oath of supremacy , there might be some plausible arguments adduced for the repeal of the parts of these acts which enjoin the repetition and subscription of the declaration against transubstantiation , & c. ; because that is a declaration against certain doctrinal points held by romanists , which do not immediately tend to a disavowal of the supreme authority of the state , so far as to countenance or commanded a resistance to the civil magistrate , and is a matter of opinion only , unconnected with the government : but their rejection the oath of supremacy is an open avowal , that they do not admit the state to have any just power to compel their submission to its laws , in any point of temporal government , intimately and inseparably connected with the administration of the supreme power in spiritual matters ; that is , in other words , they refuse and reject an oath of allegiance to the state , and insist that there is an extraneous power paramount to that of the state , to which their allegiance is due in all spiritual matters , or in all matters which that power shall deem spiritual ; and in all temporal matters which are inseparably connected with such spiritual supremacy , which amount to nearly one half of the whole temporal power of a state ; and may indeed swallow up the whole , which it has attempted in many countries : because the determination of what portion of dominion , in temporal matters , is within the vortex of spiritual supremacy , is left to a foreign ecclesiastic , and his vassal the romish priests , within this empire . The pope never did claim any temporal power , save under the pretext , that it was inseparably annexed to the supreme spiritual power , and a consequence of it . What immense temporal 871 power he claimed , and in fact exercised within this under such pretence , let our histories and statutes declare ; the fourth Lateran general council shews the extent of they authority over temporal princes and their dominions claimed by the pope.—The qualifying , subjects , who hold so anarchical a doctrine as a point of faith , to become part of the supreme power , by admitting them to a share of the supreme legislative authority rein a protestant state ; and that too a state , the powerful part of whose supremacy is lodged in a popular assembly , is in
