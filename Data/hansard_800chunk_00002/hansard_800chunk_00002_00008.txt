to an enormous amount should be constantly left in the hands of the collectors . It was in vain , therefore , that we looked for a productive revenue , whilst this anticipation and its consequent evils afflicted the country , and interfered with the application of the taxes in the most suitable ways . He did not think that it was necessary to raise any new taxes under the present circumstances of Ireland , or that any ground of necessity had been made out for them . From the review he had taken of the financial state of that country , however unfavourable it appeared , he thought he could satisfy the house that his proposition was well founded . His right hon . friend calculated the Revenue at 4,000,000l . the Loan at 3,500,000l . and gave credit for 800,354l . Now the whole of the sum to be raised amounting to no more than 8,464,983l . it struck him that any additional taxes were quite unnecessary ; and he put it to the candour of the house whether they should be imposed . He said that the proposed taxes were unnecessary , because there remained due to the treasury of Ireland a great deal more than was sufficient for covering the 13 deficiency , and the sums to which he alluded were the balances in the hands of the collectors , the revenues still due , and the arrears of the quit-rents , which amounted to 1,129,000l . The house would be astonished to hear , that the balances which remained last year in the hands of the collectors were no less than 500,000l . He did not reckon much , however , on the greater part of this , as he supposed a great deal of it could never be recovered , and the rest at a considerable expense . The next source which he should propose for the supply would be , the surplus of the consolidated fund taken at 264,619l . and the profit of the Irish Lottery rated at 100,000l . The postage of letters he should also reckon at 14,000l . The extraordinaries , or the expenses thus termed , if well regulated , would , he was convinced , add considerably to the means of the country ; he meant , by not being at all times a considerable and weighty drawback on its resources . There was one branch under the head of extraordinaries , which , he trusted , would be restricted : he meant the gain to this country , and the consequent loss to Ireland , on transmitting money to the Irish Treasury . Here the hon . gent . noticed the nature of the late loan , and the disproportioned exchange at which it was sent to Ireland . The hon . gent . also took a close view of the relative situation of both countries , and the balance of their respective debts , with a contrast of what should be the proportion of each , according to the Articles of the Union : 30,000,000 due by Ireland on the 1st of March , 1802 , were in proportion to 469,800,000. due by England , as one to 15 . When the debt of England was 469,800,000l . the debt of Ireland should be 62,640,000l . in order to make it equal to it in the proportion of 7½ to one.—58,926,356l . debt of Ireland were in proportion to 484,962,632l . debt due by England , nearly as 1 to 8 , and some fractions . To make the debt of Ireland equal to that of England , in the proportion of 7½ to 1 , it should be 64,555,172l . The hon . gent . proceeded at great length , and concluded with expressing a most ardent wish that the affairs of Ireland were before the house . The real condition of that country would convince gentlemen that its ability to pay its proportion of the joint expences of the empire had been totally over-rated . What the motive for this could have been he knew not , unless it proceeded from vanity ,
