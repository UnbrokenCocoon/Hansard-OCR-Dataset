sedition and treason at the same rate of progression , as the English ministry proceeded in Ireland with the repeal of the popery code ; and they broke out into open rebellion , and commenced a massacre of the protestants of Ireland , very shortly after a great part of that code was repealed , and they were admitted to an equality of civil privileges with protestants , the capacity of sitting in parliament , and enjoying some great civil officers , excepted.—Can any circumstance carry a more decisive proof of the wisdom of the popery code , and of the folly of repealing it , than the actual consequence of that repeal just mentioned ? and can any thing be more clear than the insufficiency of the claim of merit of romanists , on the score of their peaceable and loyal conduct since the revolution ? Loyalty certainly they never had the slightest claim to ; their avowed religions principles are disloyal . To peaceable conduct their is also ill founded in general ; and where it has any foundations , it entities them not to the gratitude of the state , because it was not the effect of choice , but of imbecility ; and that the effect of the wise system of laws , the repealed popery code . It may not be here improper to quote a passage out of the the speech of the late earl of Chesterfield , at the opening of the Irish parliament in the year 1745 , he being then lord lieutenant of Ireland , to shew the opinion entertained by that able statesman , and the government he then served , of the popery laws.— '' The measures ( said he ) that have been hitherto taken to prevent the growth of popery , have I hope , had some , and will still have a greater effect ; however , I leave it to your consideration , whether nothing further can be done , either by new laws , or by the more effectual execution of those in being , to secure this nation against the great number of papists , whose speculative errors would only deserve pity , if their pernicious influence on civil society did not both require and authorise restraint . `` —The second plea of merit of romanists , to wit , that they supported in Ireland the great measure of an union of the two kingdoms , and by their exertions effected it , is as void of foundation in fact , as the former . Every one , who has the smallest acquaintance with the history of 888 Ireland , must acknowledge , that the whole body of Irish romanists , from the commencement of the reign of Queen Elizabeth to the present time , has directed all its exertions to the separation of Ireland from England . Such separation was and is the point to which Irish romanists have uniformly directed all their conspiracies , all their massacres , all their rebellions , all their political views and measures . The Irish protestants , on the contrary , were always firmly attached to Great Britain , and always looked to Great Britain for protection , countenance and support ; being ready at all times to expend the last shilling of their property , and spill the last drop of their blood , in defence of the just rights of the British empire . The whole body of protestants till a few years back , and a very great majority of them since , were ambitious of uniting the nation indissolubly to Great Britain by an incorporating union ; and by their representatives in parliament actually petitioned the crown to procure such an union in the reign of queen Anne ; which petition was then , with unaccountable , haughtiness , rejected . But the Irish romanists , so late as the year 1795 , proclaimed their hostility to that measure . In the spring of that year , the representatives of the whole mass of the Roman catholics of Ireland , chosen from every considerable district , city , and town in
