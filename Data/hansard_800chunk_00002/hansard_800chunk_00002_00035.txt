act of disrespect and injustice to the public , what would he have thought to have seen Mr. Fordyce now under all the aggravated circumstances of the duration of his debt , and the forfeiture of his engagements , enjoying a place of similar responsibility in the revenue to the one he was deprived of ? What would he have thought to have seen this gentleman selected as the person who was to frame and introduce a system of reform and economy into the expenditure of the public money in the department of the navy ? What could he have thought if he had , heard the chancellor of the exchequer of the present day pronounce Mr. Fordyce the fittest person that could be found to fill this office of reformer . There is another reason for the house agreeing to the committee I shall finally move for , and which I had omitted to mention : whatever doubts may have been formerly entertained as to public accountants being chargeable with interest , 53 there can be none now since the act of 1800 , for which the public is likewise indebted to you , sir ; under this act , there is now 20,000l . added to . Mr. Fordyce 's debt , making the sum total 100,000l . and upwards , though I observe by the last return this interest is not added to the principal.â€”This is all that appears to me at present necessary to be said upon the subject of Mr. Fordyce 's debt ; and I feel certain it will be sufficient to induce the house to accede to the committee I shall finally move for . When I mentioned to the house my intention of bringing this subject forward , I gave notice at the same time of my intention to submit likewise a resolution to the house respecting the impropriety of Mr. Fordyce 's appointment as one of the commissioners in the new naval commission issued by the crown ; a sentiment that I have by no means abandoned , but which at present I shall forbear from expressing in the form I had intended ; if , however , sir , this house has any wish to appear in earnest with the public upon the subject of reform and economy in the expenditure of the public money , it will do well to direct its most anxious and particular attention to this new naval commission , because , under all the circumstances of the case , it is impossible that any thing can be more full of suspicion and alarm . We are all agreed , or at least we all profess to be agreed , that the commissioners appointed under the act of this house to examine into public abuses in the department of the navy , have been eminently successful in detecting and exposing the greatest frauds upon the revenue . An honourable admiral in this house , and who was one of the late board of admiralty , and who of course has had all the means of official information , has asserted , without being contradicted , that if the exposures made by the parliamentary commissioners were to be followed up by corresponding reforms , a third of the public money spent in the extensive department of the navy , might be saved . In times like the present , it is impossible that a discovery of greater importance could be made ; but what security have we , sir , for the adoption of such reform ? After two years and a half of such labours as , I believe , never parliamentary commissioners bestowed before , after nine volumes of such minute and detailed enquiries as were never made by commissioners before , the only object secured to the public is an alteration made by law in the management of Chatham chest . Sir , L understood that a pledge 54 was given by the late chancellor of the exchequer to this house , that he would move specific resolutions founded upon these various reports ; no such proceeding has , however , taken place ,
