house to disclaim , in my vote , all sinister influence , I now beg its indulgence to a few reasons , 1032 which I shall briefly and plainly advance in support of that vote.—It is impossible that I , in common with every member of this house , must not feel affected by the torrent of eloquence Poured forth by the hon . mover and supporters of the motion ; but I have not been convinced ; and while I admired , I was awakened to a sense of the necessity of recurring to those obligations which I accepted with the great and honourable trust reposed in me by my constituents ; and their sentiments on the subject now before us have been too recently and too strongly expressed in the petition on your table , for me to affect to misunderstand , or with propriety oppose : neither can I be Insensible to the paramount duty pressing upon me to support the constitution , as it hat been entrusted to my care ; and unless instructed to the contrary by the express will of my constituents , I shall endeavour , at the appointed season , to yield up my trust as unimpaired as can depend upon my humble but zealous exertions.—I know , sir , that the doctrine has often been advanced , that a member of parliament is not to be limited in his duty by local attachment ; that he is the representative not of a part but of the whole . This I reject ; and were I to admit it generally , I should feel my own case a strong and overruling exception—A great capital possesses peculiar and commanding influence over the representative ; and to attempt to despise its sense , or divert its interests , is that bold and perilous kind of enterprise which I confess I dare not undertake . I feel embarked in one bottom with the city Of Dublin ; and I never shall set my opinion above that of its electors ; nor wilfully act in contradiction to their wishes . But , sir , while I profess to obey implicitly what I conceive or know to be the will of my constituents , I deprecate the remotest idea that I entertain is feeling hostile to my catholic countrymen , or that I am not as sincerely attached to their real interest as any gent . who this night supports the petition on your table . Sir , I know that if those interests had been honestly and truly consulted , petition Would not now be under discussion ; a subject of such importance , involving such a variety of interests , and exciting such warmth of feeling , would never have been brought forward at such a time as this , nor have been made an instrument to embarrass the executive power , when the completest unanimity within and without these doors is necessary to oppose the most formidable and malignant enemy that ever 1033 threatened our political existence.— The petitioners support their claims by the assertion of their loyalty . If that loyalty is questioned , it is not by me . No man has greater confidence in the loyalty of the Irish catholic , when left to the loyalty of the Irish catholic , when left to the genuine influence of his own heart ; but I must remark , that the petition on your table holds out an indirect threat to parliament , and by asking you to do away those distinctions which make a foreign enemy rely upon the aid of disaffection , it in some degree admits , that should you not accede , such aid may be given , should the occasion offer . In the event of such a trial , I know the superior strength of Irish loyalty , and that my country , was never better prepared to meet and to crush a foreign or domestic foe . But , sir , I am willing for my own part distinctly to acquit the petitioners of any such meaning ; and I wish the Irish catholic better than
