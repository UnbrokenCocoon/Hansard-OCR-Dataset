; the removal of which tests will certainly on principle , and by probable if not necessary influence in point of fact , effectuate a total subversion of the protestant church , as established by law within these realms . I think , my lords , it will scarce be denied by any of those upon the credit of whose assertions your lordships would be disposed to place reliance , that the so strenuously contend for conferring a representative capacity on Roman catholics , is , through the means of such representatives , to procure for the body at large some further advantages in the way of a recognised church establishment , under the immediate authority of parliament . Upon this head , waving for the present all objections whatever to the religious faith and doctrines of that church , and supposing , what I by no means admit , that the points of faith and doctrine in which our church differ from theirs , are of less essential practical importance moral conduct than they appear to me to be ; allowing them to entertain , and as publicly as they please , to profess a belief in transubstantiation and in purgatory , to practice the invocation of saints , and to believe and inculcate the belief of ( what protestants consider ) a legendary chronicle of unauthentic miracles ; giving them all facilities of public and private worship and profession of faith on these worship and profession of faith on these and every other subject , if there be any yet wanting and required on their behalf ; still an establishment for their church , concurrent with that of the united church of England and Ireland , exceeds 814 even the competence of parliament itself constituted as it is , to bestow . By the 5th article of the union , it is declared , that `` the continuance and preservation of the said united church as the established church of England and Ireland , shall be deemed and taken to be an essential and fundamental part of the union . '' By fundamental is meant , with reference to the subject matter , such an integral part of the compact of union formed between the two kingdoms , as is absolutely necessary to the support and sustaining of the whole fabric and superstructure of the union raised and built thereupon : and such as being removed , would produce the ruin and overthrow of the political union founded upon this article as its immediate basis . The words `` the established church '' import that there shall be only one church of that description , and which shall alone have the privileges character , and denomination of an established church annexed to it . These terms necessarily exclude any other co-ordinate and concurrent establishment ; every other church which has any thing beyond what we commonly understand by the word toleration allowed to it , may be considered as so far established within the meaning of this article ; and the union of course , in virtue of such allowed establishment , not only to a degree impugned and violated , but by the express letter of the precise and peremptory provision referred to , absolutely deprived of its very essence and foundation ; words , substantially destroyed and subverted . I will hope , therefore that on further consideration the utter impracticability of such project , consistently with the good faith of the two kingdoms solemnly pledged to all who are at the period and by the compact of the union , will be so apparent to all who are at present striving for its adoption , as to dissuade them from the furter prosecution of a measure which , as it must commence in a violation public faith and political rights , must also terminate and dishonourâ€”I am one of those , my lords , who labour under an unfortunate persuasion that even if this could legally be , and , in fact , were granted to them ; that if the Roman catholic religion were already established in Ireland in some degree of communion and
