general council of the Romish church.—Charles VI . Emperor of Germany , executed the treaty of Alt ' Radstadt , and thereby granted certain privileges to some of his protestant subjects , and entered into some convents with the protestant princes of the empire . Pope Clement XI . in a letter to that emperor , dated June 4 , 1712 , writes thus : `` We , by these prosents , denounce to your majesty , and at the same time by the authority committed to us by 877 the most omnipotent God , declare the above-mentioned covenants of the treaty of Alt ' Radstadt , and every thing contained in it which are any wise obstructive of , or hurtful to , or which may be said , esteemed , pretended , or understood to occasion or to bring , or to have brought the least prejudice to , or any ways to hurt or to have hurt the catholic faith , divine worship , the salvation of souls , the authority , jurisdiction , or any rites of the church whatsover , together with all and singular matters which have followed , or may at any time hereafter , follow from them , to be and to have been , and perpetually to remain hereafter de jure , null , vain , invalid , unjust , reprobated , and evacuated of all force from the beginning , and that no person is bound to the observation of them or any of them , although the same have been repeatedly ratified or secured by an oath ; and that they neither could nor ought to have been , nor can nor ought to be observed by any person whatsoever . `` —The pope 's legate at Brussels , in the year 1768 , when an oath was in contemplation in parliament to be taken by the Roman catholics of Ireland , writes to Ireland in the following manner respecting that oath : — That the abhorrence and detestation of the doctrine , that faith is not to be kept with heretics , and that princes deprived by the pope may be deposed or murdered by the it subjects , as expressed in that proposed oath , are absolutely intolerable , because , as he states , those doctrines are defended and contended for by most catholic nations , and the holy see has frequently followed them in practice . On the whole he states , that as the Oath is in its whole extent unlawful , so in its nature it is invalid , null and of no effect , insomuch that it can by no means bind or oblige consciences.—It is now time to come to authorities still more modern in this point , and those of men of the Romish persuasion in high credit with our ministers . Doctor Troy , the Romish archbishop of Dublin ( who at this day openly assumes and uses the arms of that archbishopric , surmounted with a cardinal 's cap , from whence I presume him to be a cardinal ) , in a treatise which he entitles a pastoral letter , published by him in London and Dublin so late as the year 1793. , asserts , that all Roman catholics consider the express decisions of their general councils , as infallible authority in point of doctrine. '' . And Dr. Hussey , who informs us that Romish bishop of Waterford , appointed by the pope , in a pamphlet 878 styled a pastoral letter , published by him in London and Dublin in 1797 , not only holds the same doctrine , but forbids all romanists , under pain of excommunication , to permit any of their children , under any pretence , to resort to a protestant school in the same pamphlet he addresses the Romish soldiery , and exhorts them by no means to obey their officers in any orders relating to spiritual concerns , without particularly specifying what he means by spiritual concerns , but reserving the interpretation to himself and the Romish priesthood ; and stating , that if any officer should enforce
