peril the whole protestant church and its rights as by law established.—The act of settlement has provided for the protestant succession to the crown of England ; it has made the being a protestant the indispensable condition upon which the crown is to be worn by any prince 812 claiming under the limitation in favour of the heirs of the body of princess Sophia , `` being protestants . `` —It has not only required the king to be a protestant generally , but to be of that class of protestants which joins in communion with the church of England ; and it has excluded papists by industrious description : for it provides and enacts ( section 2 ) that all and every person and persons who shall or may take or inherit the said crown by virtue of the limitation of the present act , and it or shall be reconciled to , or shall hold communion with , the see or church or Rome , or shall profess the popish religion , shall marry a papist , shall be subject to such incapacities , as in such case or cases are by the recited act ( i.e . of W. and M. ) enacted and established . —So peremptory is the tenor of these provisions in exclusion of popish prince from the throne of these kingdoms , that if ( a case which is scarce within the extreme limits of actual possibility ) his majesty himself should become reconciled to the see of Rome , or profess the popish religion , the crown would in that case , by the instantaneous effect and operation of law , fall from his august and revered brows , and he would stand amongst us a mere unprivileged individual , as wholly divested of the rights , functions , name and character of sovereignty , as the meanest peasant of the land : and can it then be supposed that when such industrious pains have been taken by our ancestors to secure to the kingdom a protestant prince , that it should be left at large whether his parliament should be protestant or papist ? But this was already provided for by the test acts in the reign of Charles II . which shut the doors of parliament in both houses on persons who do not take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy , and subscribe the declaration against popery.—There restrictions on the parliamentary function and character it is now proposed to repeal ; and thus the king may be surrounded , not only by ministers of opposite and conflicting religious , but may find in the same persons a divided and distracted allegiance between his rights as their temporal sovereign , land the rights spiritual and ecclesiastical of the Roman pontiff.—It is obvious to the most careless observer , that the measures of government would be enormously clogged and impeded by the close junction and mutual adherence of the catholic members , amounting in the aggregate to a number in England and Ireland sufficiently large to inforce from a minister a degree of con- 813 descension and deference to their demands in favour of the Roman catholic religion , by which the protestant religion might be undermined and endangered.—But if the Roman catholic members are to have seats in parliament , there must be also vested in them a capacity of becoming , as well as others , the king 's minsters . I f the king 's ministers are to be taken out of the body of catholics , of what avail will it be that we have secured to us , by the act of settlement and the coronation oath , the solitary individual protestanism of his majesty ? So that at the last the whole substance of the provision made with so much anxiety and solemnity by our protestant ancestors will be come entirely futile and elusory ; for the test acts which preceded the act of settlement , and were the foundation on which alone it could practically rest , must of course be done away before the catholic members can take their seats in either house
