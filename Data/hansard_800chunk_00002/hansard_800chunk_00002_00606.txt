hold no such 893 doctrine , as that faith is not to be kept with heretics : and to shew that they look on oaths to heretics to be binding , they argue , that if they did not think themselves bound by such oaths , they would not refuse to take the oath of supremacy , the taking of which would qualify them to enjoy the privileges they are now so ardently in pursuit of . To this it is answered , that the aforesaid doctrine is contained in the decisions of the Lateran council , a very general one , and so held to be by all romanists : that the practice of the court of Rome and of all its vassals and votaries , has been always strictly conformable to such doctrine : that the recent publications of the most celebrated divines of that persuasion , and among others , of Doctors Troy and Hussey , one an archbishop , the other a bishop , and both subjects of this empire , state , `` That Roman catholics consider the express decisions of their general councils , as infallible authority in points of doctrine : '' that the rejection of the oath of supremacy by Romanists , notwithstanding their taking it would entitle them to great privileges , is no proof that they consider themselves bound by oaths , by which they plight their faith to an heretical government , or to heretics in general : because the oath of supremacy contains an abjuration of the supremacy of the pope , under the title of a foreign prelate ; and such an oath their religion will not permit them to take . Doctor Troy , among others of the eminent divines , tells them , `` That Roman catholics can not conscientiously abjure the ecclesiastical authority of the bishop of Rome , the supreme jurisdiction of the pope in spirituals being a fundamental article of the Romish faith . '' But the express decisions of the council of Lateran ( infallible authority with them in points of doctrine ) tell them that no faith is to be kept with heretics , and that all pledges of faith given to heretics , by oaths , or otherwise , are absolutely null and void , consequently are not binding , and ought not to be observed ; so that they may take such oaths , and break them at their pleasure , as absolute nullities in themselves : and such has been the constant and avowed practice of their church.—It is now time to give a general catalogue of the momentous alterations in the British constitution in church and state , which will be the inevitable consequences of this measure if it shall take place : but it is however first necessary to make a few preliminary observations.—By the union the number of Irish representatives in the commons are reduced from three hundred to one hundred ; 894 of these , sixty-four are members for counties , and the remaining thirty-six for cities and great towns . All close boroughs , with the exception of one , as I recollect , and the most of the influenced boroughs , are deprived of the privilege of sending representatives to parliament . By an Irish act of parliament in the year 1793 , obtained by the intrigues and influence of the British ministry , and passed in opposition to the opinions of the best informed men in Ireland , romanists became entitled to vote at the elections of members of parliament . Most of the cities and great towns , which retain the privilege of sending members to parliament since the union , such as Dublin , Wexford , Waterford , Cork , Limerick , Galway , Derry , Carrickfergus , and Drogheda , are counties within themselves ; and a freehold of forty shillings annual value entitles the person seised of it to a vote . Newry and some other towns are pot-walloping boroughs : so that the representatives of the Irish commons are almost all returned to parliament by elections merely and purely popular .
