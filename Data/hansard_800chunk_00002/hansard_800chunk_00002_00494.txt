at all connected with the grounds of the present petition , and urged the advantages that might be derived from making magistrates of the country gentlemen , whose religion being the same as that of the people would give them greater weight and influence , and reconcile the people to their authority . The noble earl concluded by urging the propriety of receiving the Roman Catholics to a participation of the rights of the constitution , as a measure of both justice and expediency supported the petition , and disclaimed all connection with a certain person who had been alluded to on the former night ( Arthur O'Connor ) since he had heard that he had joined the enemy . perceiving a noble and learned friend near him . ( lord Carleton ) anxious to deliver his sentiments upon the important subject then under their lordships ' consideration , was extremely unwilling to prevent the house from hearing the noble lord ; but having resided for so many years in Ireland , having during a considerable portion of that time held a high official situation in that country , and having been the individual who introduced the bill of 1793 , he was absolutely precluded from giving a silent vote . In offering his sentiments against the motion of the noble baron , however they might militate against the prayer of the petition , he was under no apprehension of being charged with prejudice or intolerance ; to such an imputation he would answer by a reference to the bill of 1793 , and it would be unnecessary for him to desire a more effectual justification than would be found in the provisions of that bill . It had given to the Roman Catholics of Ireland the full enjoyment of a perfect equality of civil rights with the rest of his majesty 's subjects , with an exemption from certain political obligations which are with-held from all except the protestant dissenters of that country . Under the impression of every thing that had been already conceded , he was never more surprised , than that the noble baron , whilst deprecating inflammatory language in others , should himself resort to so extraordinary a position , as that the refusing to grant what the Roman catholics had sought for in their petition could be justified only upon the principle of their being deemed traitors , and unfit even to be permitted to take the oath of allegiance , and if that were the , case , severe and oppressive as the penal code had been , it ought to be re-enacted , —Such an argument from the lips of the noble baron could not fail to ex- 745 cite considerable astonishment ; and more especially with those who are disposed to resist the repeal of the test and corporation acts in Great Britain ; and were it just , it must equally apply . What effect such a declaration might have upon the persons affected by those acts , he would not undertake to anticipate ; but he did not think it Consistent with that moderation which the noble lord had so strongly recommended . So far from agreeing with the noble lord , the earl of Buckinghamshire was decidedly of opinion , that considering the tenets of the Roman catholics , the indulgencies they had received from their sovereign and the legislature could only have been the result of a confidence in their loyalty ; but so long as they acknowledged a foreign ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the united kingdom , it was impossible to entrust them with any large share of political power . Doctor Troy , a man of ability and unexceptionable character , in his pastoral letter of 1793 , expresses himself in the following manner : — `` That catholics are obliged to believe as an article of their faith , that the pope or bishop of Rome , as successor of St. Peter , is the supreme visible head of the church on earth , and the centre of catholic unity , with a primacy by divine right , of real authority and jurisdiction in the
