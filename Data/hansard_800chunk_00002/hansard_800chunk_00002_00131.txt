stained with 199 the variation of each soil , and on which motley and disfigured we have grafted the more subtle poison of our days , that parliament should , on the bare assertion of any of its members , without the slightest proof acknowledge necessities of state unknown to all the world be sides but though every species of neglect and injustice may have its precedent in the history of parliament , and in the practice of ministers , I shall think it my duty to suppose , that parliament does not therefore mean to sanction neglect or injustice , and that it will not act blindly or without proof and conviction of the absolute necessity . The noble lord who spoke last seems to think that the proof of necessity is his assertion of it ; he also concludes that the present bill is entirely consouant to the principles of the militia , because the militia , in its original formation , was only for a limited , period , and contained a clause by which a rotation of officers and men were secured to the county : but nothing can be more clear than the difference between an establishment , in which the officers and men of a county had a rotation of service that gradually made the whole county fit for its defence , and a premature destruction of that defensive force , raised at the expence of the land occupiers , which is effected by this bill . The noble lord who spoke last does not , indeed , rely much upon the arguments he has used , ( and in that I am not surprised ) , but he has endeavoured to augment their efficacy , by threats . The noble load is a cabinet minister , filling a high office and a confidential situation ; he assumed tones and gestures which rendered the intelligible to those who could scarce conceive its absurdity ; he reminded those hold the offices of county lieutenants , and command county regiments , that great persons have lost such offices for offensive opinions which they held ; he hinted that the subject was delicate but , he advised deliberation and caution to those who held these opinions , before they ventured to urge them . This threat , indecent in itself and disrespectful to the house , as disgraceful to him who uttered it as offensive to those to whom it was addressed , can have no other effect than to raise the contempt of the last ; and to convince all those who heard him that the noble lord himself is capable of conforming his opinion to the pleasure of those from whom he holds his office ; that 200 he is capable of submitting to such disgraceful control I have a right to say , for he himself has told us so by uttering the threat and supposing its successful operation , [ Here lord Westmoreland rose and said that he meant no threat , but a friendly caution . ] Lord Carnarvon continued : â€” The noble lord has not by his explanation ( I had nearly said letter ) made his case much better , The popularity of a constitutional militia for home defence not exceeding 32,000 men , in 1757 , induced the land owners to petition for such force , and to charge themselves with the expence of the levy . The offered establishment was accepted , but it never found favour in the eyes of ministers , commanders in chief and generals ; they harassed the land occupiers by the burthen of its augmentation , and the officers by its reduction and conversion of the regiments , which they had formed for the internal defence of the country , into a drill for foreign service The military system of this country has been in a constant state of fluctuation for many years , but more particularly since the late war . This is the only country in Europe that has not a regular , fixed and well-known rule by which to arm themselves for offence and defence in time of war
