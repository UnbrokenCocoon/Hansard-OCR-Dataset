for them and others , consistently bestow . Their emancipation from civil and religious restraint as affecting themselves , and the rights to be enjoyed by them individually , is entire and complete ; if it be not so , let it be shewn wherein it is in any instance defective , that the defect may be , if practicable , instantly supplied and remedied . Of the condition of the catholics as his Majesty found it al the commencement of his reign , loaded with the sufferings and the fears of former times had cast upon them , and as he will hand it over to succeeding times , it may be truly said `` Lateritiam invenit , marmoream reliquit . '' Catholicemancipation , as it is improperly called , if that term is meant to denote and designate any slavish subjection as still subsisting on their part profession of religious faith , or the exercise of religious worship has been fully attained . The only remaining emancipation which they are capable of receiving must be acquired by an act of their own , be redeeming themselves from the foreign bondage and thraldom under which they and their ancestors have long unworthily groaned , and from which the state , as it has neither imposed nor continued it , has no adequate means of relieving them consistently with the duty of self-preservation which it owes to itself . Every state claiming and exercising independent powers of sovereignty , has incidentally belonging to it , as such , the power of binding its subjects by laws of its own , not only paramount to , but exclusive of any authority or control to be exercised by any other state whatsoever . In so fat as any other state or person is al- 808 lowed to exercise an authority breaking in upon this exclusive nd independent power of legislation and enforcement of authority in one state , to that extent such state so intrenched upon is not sovereign and independent , but admits itself to be subordinate to , and dependent upon the other . The declaration contained in the oath of supremacy , which expresses a denial and renunciation of the existence of any power and authority in respect of ecclesiastical and spiritual matters in any foreign state , potentate , or person whatsoever , is but the affirmance of a preposition which is logically and politically true as an essential principle not to this government only , but to every other government under the sun which claims to possess and exercise the powers of independent sovereignty . It is not only true as a maxim of government , but essentially necessary to be insisted and acted upon , also , in all cases in obedience may become questionable , in order to give the state that assurance and test which it has a right to require and receive from its subjects , of their entire submission and fidelity in all matters to which the power and authority of the state can extend . But , it is said , that what is prayed by this petition is not a matter which impugns the authority of the state in matters to which its authority extends . That the reserve made by our Roman catholic brethren is only in favour of matters which concern God and their own consciences ; matters of mere abstract faith , and mental persuasion . That however is not so ; the pope , in virtue of his general spiritual authority , claims anthority in matters of mere faith ; he claims and habitually exercises on some subjects a power of dispensing with oaths , and in that respect of nullifying all human sanctions whatsoever , as far as they affect the conscience through the medium of oaths ; he claims and exercises by himself , and delegates to others , and effectual , or supposed effectual , power of absolution . What fatal effects the power , as exercised by the Roman catholic priesthood and applied to a credulous multitude , is capable of producing upon the civil and political condition of that community in
