( as will be presently shewn ) above eighty romanists , out of the hundred Irish commoners , will obtain seats in the imperial parliament : â€” a strong hand , indissolubly knit together , who will certainly be allies to every junto of republicans , every band of dissenters , in every opposition to government , unless they shall be gratified to the utmost extent of their wishes , by the utter subversion of the constitution church and state . Can any doctrine make more for the purposes and designs of the infidel and republican factions in our empire ? Can any measure more directly tend to the subversion of our constitution in church and state , and the introduction of anarchy , democracy , and infidelity ? It may be justly remarked , that this measure for the elevation and aggrandisement of popery , following so immediately on the heels of the Romish rebellion in Ireland , and the horrible massacre of the Irish protestants in the course of it , coupled with the almost general pardon of the principal traitors and murderers , actors in if it should be adopted , must , by every reasonable man , be considered as public reward conferred on Irish romanists for their rebellion and cruel murder of their protestant fellow subject blood ; and that too a reward of the utmost magnitude and value : it is al- 892 ready proved , that it can not be esteemed a reward of their merits , for merits they have none . The favourers of this measure allege , that it is calculated to produce unanimity among the European subject of the British empire , now more necessary than heretofore to the prosperity and independence of the state , from the overgrown power of France , and ( echoing the words of James II . in support of the same measure ) that it will render the subject of the British empire , happy and flourishing at home , and formidable abroad . But it is demonstrate that the adoption of it will produce the direct country effect , and will arm the romanists with a formidable power , which they will infallibly exercise for the destruction of the state . The religious tenets of romanists render them irreconcilable enemies to a protestant state ; they must cease to be romanists before their hostility to such a state can be extinguished : they hold , as infallible doctrines , the decrees of the fourth Lateran council : they hold as a point of faith , the supremacy of the pope : they hold themselves bound by all the obligations of religion , to propagate these doctrines by every means of persuasion and force . In conformity with such doctrines they hold , that all people , differing from them in matters of faith , are heretics doomed to eternal perdition : they hold that no faith is to be kept with heretics : they hold that no oaths of allegiance to an heretical prince or government are binding , Can the members of such a sect be admitted to share in the government of a protestant state ? I conceive that no honest man in his reason will answer in the affirmative . No protestant state in Europe , in the government of which the people at large had share , such as the republic of the United Provinces before the late revolution , ever admitted a romanist or any person who did not profess the religion of the state , to any portion of political power . No arguments in favour of the measure can be deduced from the employment of romanists in some department of the state by states the people at large have no political power , and the ministers must implicitly obey the orders of the prince ; yet even in such despotic states , the instances of the elevation of romanists to great employments are very few , if any . It may be objected , that romanists declare themselves ready to swear allegiance in temporal matters to a protestant government ; and assert , that they
