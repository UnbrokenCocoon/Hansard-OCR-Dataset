it his duty to that measure to the utmost of his power , and had great satisfaction in thinking that he resisted it with success , as 707 he conceived the measure would before the union have been attended with the greatest disadvantage and even danger . When the union between Great Britain and Ireland was happily effected , he confessed he thought he saw a moment when the same objections did not exist , and indeed was of opinion that it would have been expedient , at least , to consider whether such alterations could not be made in that code of laws which imposes disabilities on different classes of his Majesty 's subjects , with a view of entering into some general plan , as might , under proper provisions , admit every person complying with those provisions into all the privileges enjoyed by his Majesty 's subjects in general , without endangering the present church establishment , and he thought that such participation should have been extended to other sects as well as to the catholics . His lordship expressed his opinion that such a measure might at the above period have been introduced with advantage , steps having previously been taken to conciliate the feelings of the learned professions , the law and the church : circumstances , however , took place , which induced Lord Camden to be convinced that it would not be expedient , at the time alluded to , to take steps even to ascertain if the measure were practicable , and of course that the measure itself could not be introduced with any chance of success . Such was the opinion of those who quitted his Majesty 's service in 1801 , and till the present moment it has not appeared that any of those persons have felt that the question could be brought forward with propriety ; he was , therefore , yet to learn what there was the present situation of affairs which could induce their lordships to consider the present an advantageous period for such a discussion . He was decidedly of opinion that in the present state of the feelings of the country , it was imprudent to agitate the question , for the sake of those very persons who are represented as desirous of having it brought forward . Although he did not see the danger in granting those privileges to the Catholics which some persons did , Yet he was fully persuaded that they could not at the present moment be granted without creating great discontent amongst other classes of dissenters as well as the members of the established church . He therefore deprecated the discussion , but if it must proceed , he had made up to oppose going into a committee , not only upon the grounds before stated , but also as objection to doing so for any of those purposes , which the speech introducing the mo- 708 tion represented as belonging to the subject , but to which the words of the motion and the general character of the noble lord 's ( Grenville 's ) speech did not appear to lean . â€”I have made more than one attempt to address myself to your lordships ' notice at an earlier period of the debate . An advantage will result from my want of success , both to your lordships and myself ; that I shall not , at this late hour , from the length of what I have to offer , either trespass too long on your lordships ' patience , or exhaust my own strength . I shall avoid a repetition of those arguments which have already been urged with much ability by those lords who have delivered their opinions . If ever there was a subject , the consideration of which peculiarly and imperiously called for temperate discussion and dignified moderation , it is that of the petition , which has been presented to this house by certain noblemen and gentlemen of property in Ireland , on behalf of themselves and others professing the Roman catholic religion .
