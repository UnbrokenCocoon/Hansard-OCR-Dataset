had always been that it was much exaggerated by statements in this country , and that a few French officers there were not dangerous in the way they were supposed to influence the natives a thousand miles from the coast . He thought the principle laid , that we were not to pursue conquest for the sake of extension of territory , was the true policy of this country ; and that so much had been done to render it doubtful whether we had not abandoned that principle , it became necessary now to give the world assurance , that Such is to be our guide , and this he wished to be distinctly avowed . He thought that we had now an extent of territory in India ; that we should never be able to preserve it ; for the governments of India were so loose , that almost any adventurer would find followers when he wished to kindle the flames of war , and therefore there was a necessity for recurring to the principle of our former resolution , since the expences of the war had been already 244 productive of great evils to this country . said , he did not wish that this subject should be too much detailed in parliament , but as he had had long experience in India , he thought it his duty to put the house in possession of his sentiments upon this most important question . His hon . friend who had just spoken , had alluded to what past with reference to the court of directors , and the dispatch of the marquis of Wellesley of the 21st Dec. on the subject of the treaty of Bassein , by which it appeared that the noble marquis expressed himself as having received the approbation of his majesty 's government and court of directors , but the truth of the matter was , that the terms of that treaty were never brought before the court of directors , neither was there among them any discussion concerning it , desired or admitted ; and with regard to the idea of departing from a system of policy formerly laid down , or of their having expressed approbation of what was done in India , or that any question was discussed by them on the subject of war or peace in India , or of the extent of the territories of the British empire .

Now whatever consequence the directors might have , they had no share in the management of sending any thing to India on the subject of the political , system there , and there- 245 fore that they could not send any thing to India , which did not previously obtain the sanction of the board of control , of which several members of his majesty 's cabinet are members
