the king `` to the utmost of his power to maintain the laws of God the true profes- 909 sion of the Gospel , and the protestant reformed religion established by law . '' Shortly after the accession of William and Mary , it was deemed necessary to add further fortifications to the established religion by statute in Ireland . The test and corporation acts passed in England in the reign of Charles II . And in the 30th year of the same king 's reign , the act passed enjoining the taking the oath of supremacy , and repeating and subscribing the declaration , by all members of both houses of parliament , previous to their sitting or voting in either house : by the coronation oath , as settled by the 1st of William and Mary , the king swears , that he will to the utmost of his power maintain the protestant reformed religion established by law ; the obligation , of this oath extends to Ireland , so that he is bound to the utmost of his power to maintain it in Ireland , as well As in England , as then established in England by law ; and all the barriers for its support erected in England previous to the 1st of William and Mary . The English parliament in the 3d and 4th of William and Mary passed an act , enjoining all members of both houses of parliament in Ireland to take the oath of supremacy , and repeat and subscribe the declaration , the parliament of England at that time exercising the power of binding Ireland by its acts ; not for the purpose of making any addition to , or alteration in the protestant religion established by law in that kingdom , but to give that establishment an additional security . How then does it follow from the premises laid down by the author of the pamphlet , that his present majesty or future king of Great Britain and Ireland , having taken the aforesaid coronation oath of the 1st of William and Mary , can , consistently with that oath , consent to the repeal of the aforesaid English statute of the 30th of Charles II . or the above mentioned statute of the 3d and 4th of William and Mary ? His present majesty swore to maintain to the utmost of his power the church established by law in England and Ireland , as he found it established by law , at the time of his accession , and not as it was established by law in the 1st of William and Mary ; though in fact it is the very same church , which was established by law in England and Ireland that time , and which has received an additional barrier in Ireland since , by the enaction of the said English statute of the 3d and 4th of , William and Mary for that country . I apprehend I have taken up too much time in refuting this absurd argument , and shall only further observe , that is not cre- 910 ditable to an Annotator on Coke on Littleton to support the cause of his party by the quibbling of special pleading.â€”It is necessary however to make a few remarks on what the author has adduced as facts to support his argument . He states that the coronation oath was fixed in Ireland by the 1st of William and Mary ; true it is , it was fixed as well for England as Ireland , by the English statute of the 1st . of William and Mary ; but the author has totally omitted to state the additions to the coronation oath introduced by the act of union of England and Scotland , the 5th of Anne . By this act the king is obliged at his coronation to `` swear ( as is already noticed ) to maintain and preserve invoilably the settlement of the church of England ; as specified in that statute , for the unalterable security of that church , and the , doctrine , worship , discipline , and government
