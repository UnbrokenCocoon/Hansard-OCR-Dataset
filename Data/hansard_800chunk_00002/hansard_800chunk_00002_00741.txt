do in the causes of rebellion ; that its leaders were many of them protestants , and men of all sects were engaged in it , though the majority were necessarily catholics , as that is the religion of five to one of the whole population of Ireland . It has been objected , that by placing 1088 catholics in the offices of sheriffs and under sheriffs , you would give them an inordinate power and influence , which they would use to the subversion of protestant interest . To this opinion I can not agree . I have been at some pains to obtain information upon the subject , and had some conversation with a respectable gentleman , a Mr. Gregory , who possesses a considerable estate in the catholic county of Galway ; and he told me that county was of late very quiet , much much quiet than usual , and the cause to which he attributed this repose was , that many catholic gentlemen had of late been appointed magistrates , and exerted their influence to quiet the county ; a proof that catholics are not disposed to use the power placed in their hands to promote insurrection or excite commotion . In a word , my lords , I am convinced the prayer of that petition ought to be complied with . We owe it to the people of Irelandâ€”we owe it to those to whom it was held out as a condition of acquiescence to the union , and to whom , as I said before , no boon has been given since the establishment of that measure , but an increase of taxes . If I were an Irishman , I would say to the legislature of this country , I am not that abject slave you take me for ; I 'm man , obstinate man , and will not be controll 'd .
