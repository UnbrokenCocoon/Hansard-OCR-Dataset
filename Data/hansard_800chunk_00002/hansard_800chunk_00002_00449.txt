establishes the truth of this very course of reasoning . When , at the restoration , apprehensions and jealousies were entertained both of the presbyterians and catholics , parliament began by passing against the corporation act , principally directed against the former . They afterwards passed the test act , principally directed against the latter ; no limitation then existing or being adopted with respect to the crown itself : and when the Duke of York publicly avowed his conversion to the roman catholic religion , 678 and a bill was in consequence introduced into parliament with a view of excluding him from the throne ; it was professed by those who successfully opposed that bill , that they would agree to any limitation on the exercise of the power of the crown , though they would not consent to break in on the course of succession . The king made a declaration conformable to the same principles , the exclusion bill was rejected by this house , and it was not till after the country had the experience of the evils arising from a catholic king , that , in the future settlement of the constitution and the throne , the same limitation was extended to the crown with regard to religion , which had been previously imposed on the great officers of the crown , and on the members of the both houses of parliament.—The adoption , therefore , of this principle with respect to the latter , was antecedent , in point of time , to the adoption of it with respect to the former ; the importance of the limitation , in this instance , for the security of our establishment , appears to have been judged to be at the least natural and essential as in the case of the crown itself ; and the objections which were felt to apply to such a limitation on the crown were considered truly as in no degree applying to a limitation on the offices of the crown.—I come now to consider what might be practical effects of a removal of all these limitations and restrictions which our ancestors have adopted for the security of the constitution . These restrictions apply both to the dissters and the catholics , but to the latter in a much more extensive degree than to the former . It may be material , therefore , in this distinction . There are certainly some classes of protestant dissenters who differ from the church of England , on matters of doctrine , as widely as the roman catholic ; there are some who differ even more widely on the subject of hierarchy and church government : but there is this important distinction between protestant dissenters of every description and roman catholics ; the former admit that all ecclesiastical matters may be the subject of internal regulation ; they acknowledge no foreign jurisdiction , they pay no foreign allegiance : the catholics , on the contrary , acknowledge a jurisdiction in a foreign power . I am aware that this jurisdiction is stated to be confined to spiritual and ecclesiastical matters : but it must be obvious to every person who has 679 considered , the subject that it is impossible , in many cases , to separate civil from ecclesiastical power . In the catholic religion , above all others , the jurisdiction and authority of the priesthood interfere in a great part of the civil and domestic , concerns of life . Let any person reflect how large a proportion of the property and civil rights of individuals must depend on the legality and validity of marriage ; yet on this subject the opinions and practice of the catholics differ essentially from those of the established church . They consider marriage as contract to be entered upon , in many cases , under different conditions and in different circumstances from those which are prescribed : by the laws of the country , and , when completed , to be incapable of dissolution , on any account , by . any human authority . The power to whom they appeal , on all those
