had stated should be distinctly and minutely inquired into , and each of the reports before the house fully examined . Still , notwithstanding this impression upon his mind , he would leave it to the feelings of the house to take whatever course it mint think proper , but he would not himself press any particular motion . then rose . He animadverted on the several charges which had been advanced by the right hon . gent . who spoke last against the commissioners of naval enquiry . As to the first , which regarded what the right hon . gent . professed to consider the premature publication of any of the subjects referred to in the several reports from this commissionâ€”he could not deem it any fair ground of accusation against the commissioners ; for it did not appear that they had designedly given publicity to the rumours referred to . Besides , indeed , whether such things were kept secret or not in the way desired by the right hon . gent . appeared to him to be a matter scarcely worth notice . As to the case of the comptroller of the navy hoard and his alledged misappropriation of the money entrusted to his care , the right hon . gent . seemed to think that if opportunity for explanation had been afforded that comptroller , as well as to lord St. Vincent , much confusion would have been avoided , as appeared in a part of the noble lord 's evidence in the eleventh report . Now , for his part , he saw no such confusion . Even without the explanation recently offered to the house on this point , he really thought that nothing could be clearer from the context of the evidence , and from a fair consideration of Lord St. Vincent 's answers to the two questions which were lately the subject of discussion , than that the noble lord was ignorant of the money matters which formed the gravamen of the charge against the comptroller of the navy . But the right hon . gent . asked why was not this comptroller examined by the commissioners touching this charge , as well as the earl of St. Vincent ? He would tell that right hon . gent . that the comptroller of the navy was examined , and that he defended himself from answering questions under the 5th clause . After having done so , then he would , put it to the right hon . gent . whether , if he himself were one those commissioners , he would propose to examine again him or any man who so acted ? With respect to the statements of the right hon . gent . as to the 574 conduct of this commission in the first report , he must observe , that if those statements were well founded , the navy board seemed to have been very passive under the serious imputations cast upon them . They professed to feel themselves very unjustly accused . The report containing this accusation had lain on the table for nearly two years , since June 1803 , and during that period the commissioners of the navy board acquiesced in suffering the impression against them to circulate . No jealousy as to their character was heard of until within these few days . No inquiry to vindicate their fame was proposed or hinted at . Surely they could have brought forward a motion had they felt so sorely as is now pretended . That there might be some parts of the conduct of those commissioners fairly to be found fault with was very possible . But yet , if they were culpable only in a small degree , that was no reason to be alledged against the motion . If , however , it appeared that they dealt unfairly by the characters of men , that was a serious charge ; and although it might be proper to continue the commission , most certainly the names should be changed . For it doubtless would be absurd to continue those in power whose conduct had
