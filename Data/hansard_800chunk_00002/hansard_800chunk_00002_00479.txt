baron who opened the debate made a profession of , and which the noble lord who sits near him appeared to me somewhat to depart from , had this part of the subject not been brought forward.—I will not follow the noble lord through the different objections he stated as likely to be made to his measure , because , I have not heard them made by any noble lord on this side of the house . Who has stated the principles of modern enlightened catholics to be those entertained in the times of the first councils , or in the dark and corrupt ages of the Roman church ? —Who has stated the Irish catholics to be participate in the privileges and distinctions of the constitution ? —I have not heard any thing of the kind fall from the lips of any noble lord ; if there 722 had , I should have been one of the first to contradict it . In truth , my lords , I can not help , thinking , with great respect be it said to the noble lord , that much of his lordship 's speech was consumed in conjuring up phantoms for himself to buffet.—I will not enter into the abstract question whether it be safe to remove at once all those guards and barriers Which our ancestors thought essentially necessary for the preservation of our constitution in church and state . I do not think it necessary to declare an opinion , that the enlightened catholics of the present day do not entertain those principles of persecution of persons of a different faith , and of want of regard to oaths made to heretics , which had formerly made them objects of distrust and apprehension to protestant states ; it would be idle to do so ; nobody now entertains any such opinions.—I am well , acquainted with many of the subscribers to the catholic petition , and I assert with confidence , that they arc not excelled in character , in loyalty to their prince , and in attachment to the constitution , by any the most distinguished of the protestants . The noble lord ( the earl of Fingall ) whose name stands second on the list , is one of the best and most distinguished characters the united kingdom can boast of.𣀔I mean to confine myself merely to this part of the subject , namely , whether this be the fittest time to bring the petition before parliament ? The noble baron asserts , it is , and at the same time declares , that he esteems the moments he presented it and argued on its merits as the happiest of his life . I differ here from the noble lord ; our opinions are far as the poles asunder . What , my lords , this the fittest time to agitate a question which rouses every passion , and calls into action every civil and religious prejudice ; this the fittest time , when the united kingdom is assailed on all sides by the most formidable enemies , and when , at the moment that I am speaking , French emissaries are traversing Ireland in every direction , announcing an immediate invasion of that island , and promising to those who shall join them the establishment of their religion , and the property of those lands which they now hold as farmers ? —But the noble lord says , that any evils that may arise will be ascribable to those who reject the petition , not to those who bring it forward ; that greater evils would have arisen from refusing to present the petition than any that can flow from agitating the subject ; that the catholics called eagerly for its 723 presentation . I lament I must main differ from the noble baron ; I have some knowledge of that country , and , from every information I have been able to obtain , I decidedly assert , that the catholics were not anxious to agitate the subject now ; that they did not think the time opportune , or that they were now
