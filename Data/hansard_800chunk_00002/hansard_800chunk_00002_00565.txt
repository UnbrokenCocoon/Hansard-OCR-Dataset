on which I have lately had occasion to address you . It is certainly a sort of recreation , if I may be allowed so to express myself , after having been obliged to perform the harassing duties of accusation ; after having promoted enquiries into circumstances , certainly not more honourable to the country at large than to the individual concerned in them ; after having had my mind so harassed and occupied , to feel that I am not now the mover of accusation , but that I am pleading the cause of my fellow subjects , and that I urn endeavouring to add to the strength of the country , without taking from the credit , power , or authority of any living man in the empire . I can not help being sensible of the contrast between the duties lately imposed upon me , and that of attempting to draw the attention of the house to a subject , which , however embarrassing the discussions of it may be to some persons , has at least this advantage , that it rests entirely on principles of general affection and good will , connected With views which every man must approve , and no man can condemn . The question , sir , that I have the honour of bringing before you , and I do feel it a great honour to have been desired to bring it before you , is no less than a petition , signed not indeed by any very great number of persons , but embracing , and I take it at the lowest calculation , when I say , one-fifth of his majesty 's subjects . Nay , further , I believe I shall not be incorrect , if I state them at one-fourth of the whole of his majesty 's subjects in Europe . My duty , therefore , calls upon me to plead the cause of 3 or 4 millions of the people of Ireland , without reference to the proportion they bear to the population of that part of the empire , but which must be allowed to contain the greater proportion of the catholic subjects of his majesty—a proportion amounting to nearer a fourth than a fifth of the whole population of the empire . I feel particularly fortunate , that when I am 835 * pressing the claims of the catholics of Ireland to the consideration of this house , I am not pressing them as adverse or hostile to the power or pre-eminence , much less the liberty , or privileges , of the subjects of any other part of the country . If I could persuade the house to do justice to the catholics , I should persuade them to render a most important service indeed , perhaps the most essential that remains to be done , or that ever was done , for the security , the greatness , and general weal of the empire , whether with regard to its internal policy , or external relations.—It may be somewhat difficult for me to choose on what part of the subject it is most proper to begin . The plain and simple statement of the question , and the first argument in support of it , would naturally be drawn from matter of fact , concerning which no controversy or difference of opinion ever did or can exist ; I mean the number of persons who are affected by the question . If I had not heard that different opinions were entertained with respect to the policy and expediency of granting the prayer of this petition , I should hardly think it could be a question , whether a portion of his . majesty 's subjects , so considerable as nearly one-fourth , should be on a footing With the remainder , or should have the enjoyment of equal laws , privileges , or advantages , and the full participation and benefit of the constitution and government of the country ? Against the principle so generally stated , cause may be shown , suppositions may be urged , and facts may be referrer
