trade was taken off , and , there was an excess of 3 millions of yards : so far with respect to trade . We stand not in the situation we did some years ago ; we are not in a declining way , taken upon a comparison with former years . The balance of the imports over the exports for the last five years , amounts to 1,195,000l . a year , official value . Take the excess of last year , and it is only 655,000l . so that the excess of the import over the export trade is not one half of what it has been for the last five years.—With respect to the debt of Ireland , let us see how it has increased . I shall not enter into the cause or the means of preventing so large an increase . We can at least shew that we have stopped the progress of that increase . In Jan. 1804 , the debt . of Ireland was 53 millions . The year before it was only 43 millions , so that there was an increase that year of 10 millions . The increase now will not be half that amount ; so that we may say we are in a better situation than we were at the close of the last year.—Having stated the situation of the trade and the , debt of Ireland , I will proceed to lay before the committee the demands , and the Ways and Means for meeting them . The whole charge of the year 1805 , for the debt of Ireland , including the sinking fund , is 2,611,623l . The proportion of 2–17ths of the sum raised by Ireland for the joint charge for the service of the year , is 5 , ,403,102l . British , or 5,853,360l . Irish , making together the sum of 8,464,98.3l . which is the sum Ireland is to provide to pay the interest of her debt , and her quota of contribution , Certainly it is a very large sum , and one can not apply one 's attention too much to the means of lessening it . In order to meet this demand , I shall take the revenues of Ireland at 4 millions . I shall explain my reason for taking them at that sum presently . A loan has been settled for 2,500,000l . which is 2,708,333l . Irish . A further loan is intended of 1 million . There was a residue , 8 on the 5th Jan. of the loan of last year , to the amount of 738,789l . British , or 800,354l . Irish , which has not been transmitted to the Irish treasury , and I shall therefore bring it forward . This comes to 8,508,687l . to meet a charge of 8,464,983l . The next thing will be to raise the Ways and Means for the interest of 2,500,000l . `` English , and 1,000,000l . Irish . On 2½ millions , at 6l . 17s . 7d . per cent , the British Irish charge is 172,062 186,400 On 1,000,000l . suppose at same rate , 68,825 Making in the whole a charge , including the sinking fund , of £255,255 I have stated that I take the revenues of Ireland at 4 millions . I shall now explain the reason why . They produced last . year 2,800,000l . The principle I go on is to put the revenues at a full peace establishment , and to raise the additional war expences . I suppose that the revenues will produce 1,200,000l . more than last year . It is pleasant to know , that the taxes which-the house thought proper to impose last year , with the exception of the taxes on excise , have operated , in the gross , perfectly to my satisfaction . The whole revenues of the country , for the two quarters ending Midsummer 1804 , amount to 1,334,000l . ; for the two quarters ending 5th Jan. 1805 , 1,886,000l . The excess of the two quarters ending 5th January is 5,52,000l .
