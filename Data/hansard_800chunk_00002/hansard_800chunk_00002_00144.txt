a single ecclesiastic of that persuasion ; and that the assertion in the said petition , that Irish Roman catholics are excluded from the privileges of corporations is wholly unfounded , inasmuch as they are admissible into all guilds and corporations on taking the oaths in their own petition recited ; and that many of them do at this time actually enjoy and exercise such privileges ; but the petitioners observe , that the object of this assertion seems to be to induce the legislature to compel the Protestant corporations of Ireland to elect Roman catholics into their franchises , in such numbers as to overbear and destroy the Protestant interest , an attempt which was made both in England and Ireland during the short and arbitrary reign of that unfortunate and infatuated king , James the Second , and which , with other serious innovations , led to the glorious re-assertion of the constitution in church and state , under the great king William ; and that the petitioners beg leave most humbly to impress upon the house , that the lower order of Roman catholics in Ireland are in possession of the same degree of civil , religious , and political liberty that is enjoyed by protestants of the same rank and station ; and even the restraints complained of by the said petition affect a very inconsiderable number of Roman catholics ; the petitioners therefore humbly conceive , that the inducement held out by the petition to the house , viz . `` that granting the demands of the Roman catholics of Ireland would extinguish all motives to disunion and means of discontent , '' is utterly fallacious ; and they most humbly submit , that if the demands contained in the said petition were acceded to , all the fences and securities of our excellent constitu- 220 tion , in church and state , established by Protestant legislators from the time of the reformation to the reign of his present majesty , would be destroyed and annihilated ; and therefore praying the house will continue to preserve unimpaired our excellent constitution , and reject the demands of the Roman catholics of Ireland . `` Ordered , that the said petition do lie upon the table .
