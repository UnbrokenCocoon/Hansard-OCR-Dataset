doctrine , that opinions without overt acts are not the objects of legislation ; because the overt acts of our own countrymen , and others , professors of this cruel and unrelenting superstition , for the purpose of subjecting the British empire to a foreign jurisdiction , since the commencement of the reign of queen Elizabeth , have been too frequent , flagrant , and notorious to be denied . Witness the bulls of Pope Pius V. and his successors , for the dethronement and assassination of that queen and James I. ; the conspiracies of her own Romish subjects , in conformity with these bulls , for her assassination , and that of her successor ; the projected Spanish invasion ; the gunpowder plot ; the desperate Romish rebellion and horrible massacre of the protestants of Ireland in the reign of Charles I. ; the obstinate and destructive rebellion of the Irish romanists in the reign of William III . ; the recent atrocious rebellion in Ireland , and the unprovoked murder of thousands of Irish protestants , men , women , and children , in cold blood : in extenuation and excuse of which rebellion and massacre , all the malevolence and falsehood of the whole republican , jacobinical , Frenchified faction in England , have been ever since employed ; in too many instances with a pernicious and even a fatal effect.—In justification of the present proposed measure , pleas of merit in the modern race of Romish subjects have been advanced ; and first , that they have conducted themselves peaceably and loyally ever since the revolution , though under the pressure of rigorous , impoverishing , and disqualifying statutes ; and a great minister of state , ( the present chancellor of the exchequer ) has been so far deluded by the misrepresentations and falsehoods of Romish advocates and emissaries , as to declare himself a patron of their claims , on the score of their patience and forbearance for a century past . Secondly , it has been asserted , that the Irish romanists heartily concurred in the measure of union of the two nations ( though it : was opposed by the Irish protestants ) , and by their power , influence , and interest , not only contributed to the success of that great measure , but were the chief instruments of it.—The truth of these two pleas I will separately examine , and reply to them both . 885 The first is a plea of loyal and peaceable conduct of the romanists of the empire since the revolution . When the Romish scheme of subversion of the protestant establishment in church and state , under the conduct , patronage , and influence of the bigoted monarch who then swayed the British sceptre , was completely defeated by the spirit of the nation ( raised and directed by the renowned William III . ) , but through the medium of a bloody civil war , from the obstinate resistance of the Irish romanists the political power and consequence of the romanists in Great Britain were annihilated , and in Ireland reduced to a very low ebb . In Great Britain their dwarfish number , compared with the gigantic multitude of protestants , ensured the political impotence of the seat ; but the case was different in Ireland : the romanists exceeded the other subjects in number in that country ( though not in the magnified ratio stated in their own inflated accounts ) , which prevented their sinking into political impotence . Yet their decisive defeat at that period reduced them to great political imbecility : though fallen to the earth in both kingdoms , their reiterated conspiracies and rebellions induced the state to guard against their acquisition of new strength after their fall , Antæus-like : hence sprung the system of what are called popery laws in both kingdoms , enacted since the revolution . These laws , by popish writers , and the abettors of popery throughout the empire , are represented as most oppressive and unjust ; and as the causes of the notorious disaffection of the romanists to
