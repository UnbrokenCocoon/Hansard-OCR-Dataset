service , unless protected by extraordinary exertions of the family , or under some very peculiar circumstances . The poorer protestants had therefore great difficulties in putting out their children . As officially a trustee of several charities in Dublin , as well as from the information of others , he had 1082 means of knowing the truth of this assertion ; and he could particularly state that the applications for the benefit of charities in Dublin , established , for pitting poor Children apprentices , were astonishingly numerous ; and the reason assigned by those who applied was , that they could not get employment for their children as domestic servants , or labourers , and were compelled to bring them , up to handicraft trades.—Viewing he state of Ireland as he did , he could not repeat his conviction , that it was necessary , though the necessity was much to be deplored , to keep with anxious care , the remaining restrictions on the Roman catholics of that country . In his opinion not only the security of the church establishment , but the properties and even the lives of the protestants , and the connexion of Ireland with Great Britain , depended on the preservation of those restrictions , until a great and important Change should be made , in the temper and conduct of the Roman catholics , and their priesthood should be put on a very different footing . To conciliation he had ever been , and ever should be , a warm friend , but the terms of conciliation must be very different from those proposed by the petition . He could not be deluded by pretence of conciliation to increase the power and means of offence of that hierarchy which tyrannised over those of their own persuasion , which set all law at defiance , and threatened at every moment the extirpation of the , protestants of Ireland . The abolition of that hierarchy was in his opinion the first step to that conciliation which he believed could alone produce peace to Ireland : and the Roman catholic laity , desiring a full participation of the benefits of the British law and constitution , one of which , and not the least important is freedom from ecclesiastical tyranny , must first throw off the yoke of their own priesthood ; which , whilst it exists in all its force , renders the participation which they require dangerous to themselves , and utterly incompatible with the peace of the country , the safety of the protestants , and the connexion of Ireland with Great Britain . rose and spoke as follows : I rise , my lords , to state the sentiments which occur to me , on the best consideration I have been able to give this important question ; and in support of the vote Which I this night mean to give . My lords , if I rightly understand the petition on your table , it goes to the claim of measures which become necessary to the relief of a great body of his majesty 's catholic subjects in Ireland , from certain restrictions and disabilities under which they still labour on account of their religion . And , thy lords , I consider that claim not as of a boon , but as of a right which every British , subject in this united kingdom should enjoy , as his birth , right , who is not dis-entitled thereto by any thing exceptionable in his principles , his character or his loyalty ! If considered it as a boon I should still say to your lordships 1083 —grant it to them—liberally and generously now , rather than at a future period , when the justice of the claim and the policy of acceding to it , will force itself upon your lordships ' wisdom ; and therefore , let it rather be granted now , and with the appearance of liberal concession , than at another period , when it will have that of being extorted from you . Much , my lords , has been said with respect
