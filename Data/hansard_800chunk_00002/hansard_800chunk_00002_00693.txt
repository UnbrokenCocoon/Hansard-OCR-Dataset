advantage to the claims of those whose petition is now under consideration , or with any hope of reconciling all differences , of burying all animosities , and of producing that perfect union in the advantages of which gentlemen on all sides so entirely concur . What the circumstances were to which I allude , m as having at that time prevented me from calling 1018 the attention of parliament to this subject , in the manner and With the Prospects Which I wished , it it not now necessary for me to state . All the explanation which I thought it my duty to give , I gave at that time—more I do not feel myself now called upon to give ; and nothing Shall induce me to enter into further details upon this subject . It shall therefore now content myself with stating , that the circumstances which made me feel that it was then improper to bring forward this question , and which led to the resignation of the then administration , have made so deep , so lasting an impression upon my mind , that so long as those circumstances continue to operate , I shall feel it a duty imposed upon me not only not to bring forward , but not in any manner to be a party in bringing forward or in agitating this question . Having said thus much , sir , upon the opinions I then entertained , upon the principles which then , and I trust always will , govern my conduct , I think it right to add , that the whole of the plan Which I had formed , the whole essence of the system . which I meant to have proposed , was a measure of peace , of union , of conciliation—a measure which I did hope would have had the effect of softening down all religious differences , of extinguishing all animosities , and of uniting all men of both religions in one common zeal for the preservation of the constitution , and for the general happiness and prosperity of the empire . But , sir , desirous as I then was of proposing this measure , and sanguine as I was in my hopes off its success , nothing could be further from my intention than to bring it forward if there did not appear a rational prospect of its being carried , ( not with unanimity , for upon such , an important subject that I knew was impossible ) , but with general concurrence ; because I knew , that if it were brought forward under other circumstances , instead of producing the effect I wished , it would only tend to revive those animosities which I wished to extinguish , to aggravate those difficulties which I wished finally to remove . Not being able , from the circumstances to which I have alluded , to propose the measure which I thought likely to be productive of such beneficial effects , I did then form the determination not to press it at any period , unless I thought it could be done with that prospect of success , and with that general concurrence , without which it can never be beneficial . When I use the term general concurrence . I am sure I shall not be supposed ever to have been so visionary as to suppose that a question of such immense 1019 importance , and upon which men 's feelings and passions are so strongly excited , could ever be carried with perfect unanimity , but I mean with that general concurrence which would have enabled us to gratify the wishes of one party , without awakening the fears , or exciting the jealousy of the other . Whatever gentlemen may think of the abstract rights of the petitioners , or of the expediency of complying with the prayer of their petition , I am sure they will agree with me in thinking , that the chance of extinguishing all those animosities which have unfortunately prevailed , and of producing that perfect union which we all wish , most depend upon
