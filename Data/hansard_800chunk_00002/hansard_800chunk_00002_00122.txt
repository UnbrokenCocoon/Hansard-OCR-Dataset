hon . bart . stated to be this , that the house should be put in possession of the nature and conduct of this singular commission . It appeared , that notwithstanding their appeal to the judgment of the attorney and solicitor general of England , they had acted in direct contradiction to the opinion delivered by those learned gentlemen . But still more , and it was particularly necessary to call the attention of par- 185 liament to the subject , this commission had now been existing for several years , without really having any thing to do , and seemed still determined to go on . The commission consisted of four persons , each of whom received a salary of 1,200l . per year , and it was now above three years since the commissioners wrote a letter to the lord lieutenant , stating , that their business was so much diminished that they had no occasion to meet every day , as they had previously done , and requesting that they might be called on to meet only every Monday . In order to contrive some appearance of employment , he understood that those commissioners prolonged an inquiry upon a particular claim for several months , dividing the inquiry between them two and two alternately , Monday after Monday . It really struck him as matter of surprize and shame that such a commission should have been so long tolerated , and there appeared no disposition whatever to put an end to it . Indeed , according as it went on , it was likely to continue for ever , unless something was done to terminate its existence .
