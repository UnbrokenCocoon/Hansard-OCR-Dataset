the purpose of opposing the motion ; for that , he thought , was called for by the particular circumstances of the present case , and he was aware of the importance of the bills in question to the revenues ; but , in discharge of the duty he owed their lordships , to endeavour to impress on their minds the general necessity of scrupulously adhering to their standing orders , on which so much of the dignity and correctness of their lordships ' proceedings depended . On that ground , he had therefore to express his earnest hope that no similar occasion would again occur where it might become necessary to suspend the standing order of the house . Sufficient time ought to be given for the due consideration of bills in that house ; and he regretted that tow or three instances had occurred this session in which the standing orders had been suspended . He was aware that the calculations respecting the accounts between England and Ireland were difficult and complicated , and might probably take up much time . He repeated however his hope that a similar instance of suspending their standing orders , for want of sufficient time to go through a bill in its ordinary stages , would not again occur.—The question being put : the Irish Sugar Bounties Drawback , and Promissory Notes bills , were , on the motion of lord Walsingham , accordingly forthwith read a third time and passed.—Adjourned . rose , and said , that agreeably to the notice he had given , he was about to offer to their Lordships a petition from certain of his Majesiy 's subjects in Ireland , professing the Roman Catholic religion .
