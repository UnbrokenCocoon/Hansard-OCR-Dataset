which it is allowed to prevail , let the recent experience of Ireland during the late rebellion attest , where wretches , reeking with the blood of their murdered countrymen , have been purified from the guilt of past atrocities , and prepared for the com- 809 mission of new , by the all-atoning virtues of popish absolution ; such a power as this over the conscience , engrosses and directs more than half the faculties and energy of the entire man , & c.â€”But , besides the spiritual power thus capable of being , and thus being in fact abused , the ecclesiastical power of the church of Rome over its obedient sons is enormous . It establishes and sustains in the instance of Ireland , an hierarchy dependant on the see of Rome as to the original nomination and subsequent control of its bishops and pastors , through the medium of which it enforces an obedience not in matters of faith only , but in temporal acts and concerns immediately connected with the duties and habits of ordinary life ; not only in the payment of money for the maintenance of the local ecclesiastical establishment , or for such other purposes connected with their political economy as may be thought fit by the same authority to be enjoined , but in the performance also of rites and ceremonies , particularly that of marriage , form which all civil rites originate , and which they enjoin to be performed by their own ministers exclusively , thereby ousting the law of the land , and endangering or destroying the legitimacy of its subjects , and all rights of descent , inheritance , and representation founded thereon . The power of excommunication is , in the hands of their clergy , a most powerful and dangerous engine , not of spiritual and ecclesiastical only , but of temporal power . it acts at once upon all the comforts of domestic and social life in this world , and upon all the hopes and expectations of happiness in that which is to come . With what harshness and rigour , and with what daring defiance of the established law of the land , this most operative power of interdiction has been recently applied , not to a few individuals only , but to large multitudes of people , a noble and learned lord detailed to us on a former evening . Why such an enormous conspiracy in the several parties concerned , against the established laws and government of their country , has , if fully known , been suffered to pass unpunished , I am at a loss to conceive . I can only account for it on a supposition that some insurmountable difficulties may have occurred in the obtaining of witnesses who would venture to come forward and state such facts upon oath in the face of their spiritual directors , or that a distrust of the disposition in local juries to convict under such circumstances has prevented the institution of such prosecutions as would 810 otherwise be proper for the correction of such crimes . Certainly these or some other adequate reasons must have operated to produce a temporary impunity , in cases where the safety of the state and the protection of its subjects from the enormous excesses of illegal authority seem to have so much required the application of immediate and exemplary punishment . I am persuaded it could not proceed from a want either of zeal or courage in those whose immediate duty it is to call forth and apply the energies of the law on such important occasions ; for I am well assured and know that the public spirit and manliness which hereto fore distinguished the profession of the law in that country , has by no means expired in the person of lord Clare . These are a few and but a few of the practical civil inconveniences which might be instanced as derived to the state and its subjects from the authority of the see of Rome , spiritual and ecclesiastical , as it is exercised over the sons of its church
