the Roman catholic church in England , or in any other country in Europe , where the protestant was the established religion of the country . For when the legislature of Ire- 1062 land thought fit to reform what it deemed to be corruption and abuse in the christian church ; to abolish the usurped authority of the court of Rome , from which it conceived the corruption and abuse had sprung ; and to require the clergy of Ireland , claiming the benefits of the ecclesiastical establishment of the country , to yield obedience to the sovereign power of the state , and to abandon the powers assumed contrary to the ancient laws , and paramount that sovereignty ; and when , to inforce obedience to its laws , it required all its subjects to withdraw from communion with the see , of Rome , as inconsistent with the reformation thus attempted : such of the people of Ireland as thought fit , notwithstanding , to persist in holding communion with that see , also thought fit , not only to refuse obedience to the legislature in a point for which they might allege religious scruples , but likewise to refuse , and those who now profess to hold communion with the see of Rome still refuse , to acknowledge the validity of those laws by which the powers and revenues of the church-establishment were transferred to such of the clergy as submitted to the change , and by which all ecclesiastical jurisdiction was made subject ( as by the ancient law it had been subject ) to the control and coercion of .the sovereign power of the state ; denying therefore one essential principle of the constitution , the subjection of the ecclesiastical to the civil power . Accordingly , the Roman catholics of Ireland have ever since maintained , and still maintain , a complete hierarchy , in direct and manifest opposition , not merely to the positive law , but to this essential and fundamental principle of the constitution ; representing that hierarchy as the duly lawful successors of the ancient clergy of Ireland , assuming all the powers , and claiming all the revenues , of that clergy , treating the clergy of the reformed religion , placed in the various offices of the church by the laws and in conformity to the principles of the constitution , as usurpers ; and refusing obedience to all laws framed to curb the encroachments of the papacy on the sovereign power before as well as since the reformation . Denying , therefore , to the legislature of the country all power over the ranks , dignities , and authori- 1063 ties , and even the revenues of the church ; and thus denying one of the most important principles of the constitution , as asserted at all times , even in the darkest ages . To yield to the clams of the petitioners , the house must not only submit to abandon this important principle , which their ancestors had at all times zealously maintained , but must also consent to break the solemn compact so recently entered into by the independent legislatures of Great Britain and Ireland ; the compact by virtue of which their lordships were enabled , in that house , to consider the petition before them ; they must repeal the fifth article of the union of Great Britain and Ireland , by which the protestant churches of England and Ireland were united , and made for ever the established church of England and Ireland ; and by which the maintenance and preservation of that church , as the established church , of England and Ireland was solemnly stipulated as a fundamental article of the union itself . They must therefore hazard the continuance of that union , by a direct breach of what has been thus solemnly declared a fundamental article of the compact by which it was made . But they must do more . The claim by the petition , and the arguments founded upon it , extended in principle , to the whole empire ; and their lordships must
