discord it is indeed of the utmost importance , that , in agitating a question like the present , we should be influenced by an increased anxiety to guard against every unfair or unfavourable impression from recent injuries , or internal discontents . It is essential that we should resolve to preserve inviolate and sacred the principles of the establishment , and to extend that toleration , forbearance , and Christian charity , which are its distinctive marks , to their utmost practicable limit.—Religious toleration , my lords , is the primary principle and peculiar characteristic of our established church . By the practice of it , we have been habituated to respect and revere even the errors of the conscientious Christian ; and we have been enabled to preserve harmony and good will , not only between protestant sects , but between every denomination of Christians . Under these impressions , my lords , I have attentively perused this petition . I have endeavoured to discover what extension of personal toleration is asked , that can be consistent with our civil and religious establishment ; I have not considered what they would have given to us , but what we could with safety give to them ; —not what we might in justice have refused , but what we could in kindness have good will . How far it has been our disposition to shew , not merely toleration , but real and active beneficence to persons differing from us in articles of faith , 709 may have appeared by the reception an protection which this country has recently afforded to the French priest ; where to religious prejudices was superadded political danger ; and when we had no security against the introduction of spies and enemies ; nor any reasonable assurance that there might not be individuals among them , desirous of purchasing their returns on almost any conditions which the usurped power of the French government might think proper to dictate . In that instance we had also to encounter religious danger from the bigoted spirit of conversion , which characterizes their religion ; from the unfavourable sentiments which they had nourished from their earliest infancy , with respect to English protestants ; and from a peculiar species of domineering intolerance , which distinguishes the French from all other nations . And yet these considerations , my lords , did not deter us from receiving them with all the warm charity of Christians , and the liberality of Englishmen ; exhibited not merely by the higher orders in the hour of plenty , but by the poor and necessitous at a period of general scarcity . If we could do so much , and do it so willingly , for foreigners and enemies , can it for a moment be supposed , that we are not prepared to show every degree of warm and affectionate kindness to our friends and fellow subjects in Ireland ; can it be imagined that we shall not be ready to forget every difference of opinion , and to endeavour to promote their happiness and improvement , to the utmost of our power ? In looking to the welfare of the great mass of Roman catholics in Ireland , I mean that useful body of men which in every country must compose the most numerous class of its inhabitants , it will be wise and benevolent so to use the power which the constitution has placed in us , as a part of a protestant legislature , as to do for them individually all that ( were the power in their hands ) they would be wise in doing for themselves . In this view , my lords , it may be a subject for our consideration , how far we can better provide for the discharge of their religious duties , and how far we may with propriety assist them that respect . We may inquire how far we can improve their temporal condition , by supplying the means and motives of industry , and by every exertion of kindness , which can promote their domestic comfort , improve their character
