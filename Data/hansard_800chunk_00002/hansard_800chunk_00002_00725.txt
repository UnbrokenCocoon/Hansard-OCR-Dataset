also repeal that article of the treaty of union with Scotland by which a similar provision was made for the maintenance and preservation of the presbyterian form of church government in Scotland . Even if the petitioners had not so broadly and openly stated their claims , it must be evident that their pretensions went to this extent and it would be absurd to suppose that the Roman catholic clergy in Ireland , claiming to be the lawful successors of the ancient clergy and considering those now in possession as usurpers , would ever be content with less than the possession of the powers , and revenues which they thus claimed as their right , and the ejection of those whom they deemed to be usurpers of that right . To suppose otherwise were to suppose that the nature of man is not what the experience of all ages has demonstrated it to be ; and it was absurd to suppose that whilst the powers and revenues of the church were claimed by the Roman catholic clergy , those powers and revenues were not objects of their desires ; and that whilst those desires Were nourished by hope , and the gratification of those desires was denied , they would never be content themselves , or ever cease to excite discontent in the minds of the 1064 laity . It was absurd , therefore to suppose that Ireland could be at rest until the Roman catholic clergy had attained those objects of their desires , unless all hopes of attaining those objects were utterly extinguished , and the desire to attain had fallen with the hope by which it had been nourished It was true that the Roman catholic clergy of Ireland could scarcely hopefully-to attain those objects , or , having done so , permanently to retain their acquisition , whilst Ireland remained united to Great Britain . Separation from Great Britain must therefore be in their view , at least as a probable event , so long as they should flatter themselves with the hope of accomplishing their wishes . If the Roman catholic religion had remained the established religion of Ireland ; or if it could be now made the established religion of Ireland , consistently with a just observance of the solemn pledge given by the compact of union ; or consistently with an observance of the faith so frequently , at various times , and in various ways , pledged to the protestants of Ireland ; or consistently with the principles on which the British constitution as it now stands , connected with the title of the family on the throne , can alone be supported ; perhaps ( though this may well be doubted ) Ireland as a Roman catholic country might remain united with Great Britain . But it is too late to consider what might have been done under such circumstances ; it is too late to conjecture whether Ireland , as a country wholly Ronan catholic , could probably remain united with the protestant government of Great Britain , By solemn stipulation , which their lordships could not he persuaded to violate , the protestant must ever be the established religion of Ireland , whilst Ireland should remain a part of the united empire : and the Roman catholic could by law become the established religion , only by the most daring breach of faith , and by a shameful abandonment of the principles on which the British constitution stands . The Roman catholic can therefore never be made the established religion of Ireland by a law of the united empire , sanctioned by a prince of the family now on the throne . It can therefore only become the established religion of Ireland by a separation of Ireland from Great Britain , and the extirpation or expulsion of the protestants of Ireland . Considering , therefore , the of the petitioners as utterly inconsistent with the established laws and constitution of the empire ; as requiring a complete change , or rather subversion of that constitution in a 1065 fundamental part ; convinced that between the two religions there could
