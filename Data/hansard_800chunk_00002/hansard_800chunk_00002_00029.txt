of 44 parliament claimed as their peculiar privilege . In the course of that impeachment which was still in their recollection , the impeachment of Hastings , it would be recollected , that many such difficulties did arise . He certainly felt that a measure of such importance as addressing his majesty to remove a judge , ought not to be adopted without grave and weighty reasons , but if their lordships should be convinced by cogent reasons that a judge was unfit to hold his office , he could see no reason why the houses of parliament should forbear from presenting those addresses for his removal which the act of settlement expressly stated as sufficient ground to remove a judge from his office . contended that a committee ought to be appointed , and that the constitutional mode of enquiring into the misconduct of a judge was by impeaching him . If the accusations brought against the learned judge , who was now the defendant , could be substantiated , there were very strong grounds , indeed , for such a proceeding ; for that learned judge had been charged with no less a crime than having used seditious language from the bench . This was certainly a charge of sufficient importance to ground an impeachment on , if it could be proved . He wished the house , in the present case , to conform itself to its established usages and precedents . could not see that there could be any necessity for appointing a committee to consult precedents , when it was well known that no precedent which could be found would come near the present case . When the judges were made independent of the crown , it was clearly stated , that they were only removable by address from both houses of parliament , or by impeachment . The precedents therefore of cases which happened before the passing this law , could have no application to the present case , and he could not conceive any other ground that could be required for those addresses , except the clear conviction of both houses of parliament on due and weighty consideration , that it was proper to present those addresses . If the house should , therefore , now think it impossible for them to proceed without finding out precedents , the same reason would always apply against addressing for the removal of any judge . allowed that it was competent to either house of parliament to originate the question ; and that since the passing of the act of W. III . it was as constitu- 45 tional for parliament to proceed by the way of address as by that of impeachment , which , of course , could not originate in that house , but must come from the commons . said , that highly as he respected the opinion of his noble and learned friend , he could not help differing from him on the present question . He thought that in an entire new case , as this confessedly was , and when the house was called on to decide on an act of parliament that had never yet been acted upon or brought into considerationâ€”an act of parliament of such immense importance to every subject of the empire , because it went to no less a point than the removal of the judges from their places , he thought it was necessary their lordships should have the advantage of the opinion of the 12 judges . He thought also , that , in a case like this , their lordships could not proceed with too much caution ; and , therefore , that they ought to have the advantage of all the precedents which our ancestors had made the rule and guide of their conduct , antecedent to the time of the act of settlement . He well remembered the time when he was obliged in duty , in the line of his profession , to object to the proceedings of that house , when they went from thence to the place below , day by day , for 7 long
