these conditions of the treaty of union judge Blackstone makes these observations : `` that whatever else may be deemed fundamental and essential conditions , the preservation of the two churches of England and Scotland , in the same state they were in at the time of the union , is expressly declared so to be ; and that therefore any alterations in the constitutions of either of these churches , would be an infringement of these fundamental and essential conditions . '' The fifth article of the union of Great-Britain and Ireland is in the following terms : `` that it be the fifth article of the union , that the churches of England and Ireland , as now by law established , be united into one protestant episcopal church , to be called the United Church of England and Ireland ; and that the doctrine , worship , discipline , and government of the said united church shall be and shall remain in full force for ever , as the same are now by the law established for the church of England ; and that the continuance and preservation of the said united church , as the established church of England and Ireland , shall be deemed and taken to be an essential and fundamental part of the union ; and that in like manner the doctrine , worship , discipline , and government of the church of Scotland shall remain , and be preserved , as the same are now established by law , and by the act of the union of the two kingdoms of England and Scotland . `` —It is clear that every measure tending to the breach of these fundamental and essential conditions of the two unions ought to be rejected by this house with indignation : the very proposal of such a measure to this house is an insult to it , as it must be found 901 ed on the presumption , that this house is capable of violating the public faith reciprocally plighted by the nations composing the British empire to each other , on their consolidation into one body . If this measure should be adopted , the act of the 30th of Charles II . requiring all members of both houses to take the oath of supremacy , and repeat and subscribe the declaration , will be repealed by its adoption , as well as the bill of rights and the , test and corporation acts : these are made perpetual by the conditions of the union of England and Scotland , being enacted for the preservation and continuance of the church of England ; and as Judge Blackstone expresses it , for the prevention of crude innovations in religion and government . Exclusive of this direct breach of the conditions of the union , it is already shewn , that the whole tendency of the measure , and . its notorious consequences , are , the subversion the established church in Great-Britain and Ireland , in violation of the public faith plighted on the completion of two incorporating unions ; the introduction of infidelity and atheism , by the annihilation of all the bonds of society springing from an established religion : and the consequent introduction of anarchy and democracy—the true reason ( however disguised under the mask of liberality ) why this desolating , faithless , Gallic measure has met the approbation , and acquired the patronage and support of all the jacobins in the British empire.—It is some consolation to reflect that the subjects of this empire , attached to the constitution , have yet one barrier left to resist that inundation of impiety , democracy , and barbarity , with which this measure is calculated to overwhelm it : that is , his majesty 's coronation oath ; a barrier , I am convinced , sufficient to defend us , during the precious life at least , of the pious and conscientious prince who now sways the British sceptre ; a barrier raised by the wisdom , piety , and patriotism of our forefathers.—The oath enjoined by the statute of the first of William
