united kingdom , so that it is impossible that Protestants and Roman catholics should ever agree in administering together the powers of government , and that such an attempt would be productive of the most mischievous distractions and weakness in the public councils of the kingdom ; and that though the petitioning Roman catholics disclaim some of the mischievous doctrines of the church of Rome , yet they still admit that they acknowledge some of the most dangerous ones , amongst which must be reckoned the acknowledgement of the supremacy of a foreign power in matters of their religion , which must have a most important influence on their moral and political conduct ; and that the petitioners can not but remember , that the partiality of king James the Second for the Roman catholics , and the influence which he gave them in the public councils of the 218 country , were the sources of all those grievances which imposed upon our ancestors the necessity of effecting the revolution in 1688 , and of establishing those securities by which a recurrence of those grievances was guarded against and prevented ; and the petitioners are persuaded , that no measure could be devised more disrespectful to that great event , or to the illustrious characters that were instrumental in effecting it , or more repugnant to the principles established by it , than the attempt to give to the Roman catholics a power in the government of this united kingdom ; and that the petitioners can not but further recollect , that , by the existing laws , no Roman catholic can wear the crown of this united kingdom ; a restriction which the petitioners conceive to be founded in the soundest policy and wisdom ; nor can the petitioners help thinking , that the same wisdom and policy require their exclusion from the other branches of the legislature ; and for this , amongst many other reasons , that nothing seems more incongruous to the petitioners , than that the king should be obliged to discharge his share of the government upon Protestant principles , and that his council should consist of persons devoted , to a church of principles not only of a different hut of a repugnant nature ; and therefore praying that the laws by which Roman catholics are at present excluded from being members of the parliament of the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , and from filling the principal offices in the executive government and civil and military administration of Ireland , may not be repealed . `` â€”Ordered , that the said petition do lie upon the table . A petition of the lord mayor , sheriffs , commons , and citizens , of the city of Dublin , in common council assembled , was presented to the house , and read ; setting forth , `` that the petitioners have seen with the deepest regret a copy of a petition presented to the house by certain persons in , the name of the Roman catholics of Ireland , containing demands of political power , which , if yielded , would be ruinous to our happy constitution in Church and state ; and that the good conduct of the Irish Roman catholics , as recognized by the Irish legislature in 1779 , took place under the ope- 219 ration of severe laws , which since 1779 have been from time to time repealed , so as to place the Roman catholics of Ireland upon a footing of political power not enjoyed by any other dissenters from the established religion in any other state ; but though the Roman catholics declared , at the time of relaxing those laws , they would be fully content , yet the petitioners are sorry to observe , that that cordiality and union of sentiment which would be so desirable in Ireland has not yet taken place ; and further , the petitioners can not but observe , that the petition of the Irish Roman catholics , though professing to explain the tenets of that sect , as affecting political duties , is not signed by
