submission of the people.—In protestant despotic states it is not of great moment to the despot , what religious opinions are held by a part of his subjects : the people have no power in the state , and it is little consequence to the despot whether the men he employs as his servants are of one religious persuasion or the other , they being merely his creatures , and extinguishable at his pleasure . But in protestant states , in which the people , or their elective representatives , have some share in the government , romanists were excluded , before the baneful progress the French revolution , from all share of political power . The Swiss confederacy , composed of a league of small protestant and Romish states for their mutual security , is a strong instance of this : in the protestant cantons no romanists were admitted members of the senates , or even to any places of trust or confidence in the state a similar regulation took place in the Romish cantons with respect to protestants . In the United Provinces , so often cited as models of toleration , though all sects were tolerated , yet civil offices were only enjoyed by professors of the established religion : `` It was not there considered as a punishment on men to be excluded as a punishment on men to be exclude from public offices , and to live peaceably on their own revenues and industry . '' ( See Hume 's history , vol . Viii . Page 274 . ) Romanists were also exclude in Holland from seats in the assembly of the states general.— If therefore the British empire is to be influenced by the practice of every popular protestant state in Europe , romanists should not only be excluded from all places of trust and power , but from all situations which would invest them with any share of political power ; and above all from seats in the supreme legislative assemblies , the house of lords and commons.—But the very constitution of Britain is such , as renders the exclusion of romanists from seats in the legislative assemblies not only expedient , but of absolute imperative necessity . In the 882 British empire the supreme legislative power rests in the king , lords , and commons ; the commons being the representatives of the great mass of the people , or the democracy ; the peers the representatives of the richest and most dignified part of the people , or of the aristocracy . In these two assemblies , but particularly in the house of commons , vastly the most powerful of the two , is vested the greatest and most efficient part of the sovereign power of the state : and to admit the avowed enemies of the constitution in church and state , is so manifestly and absurdity in politics , that it is surprising such a measure should be supported by men of ability professing themselves to be friends of the constitution.—As it has been more than once openly and confidently asserted by an able member ( Mr. Fox ) of this house , that the exclusion of romanists from the houses of lords and commons is an unjust invasion of their natural rights , it is necessary here to repeat what has been already mentioned , that romanists exclude themselves , by their rejection of the oath of supremacy ; an oath enjoined to be taken not by them alone , but by all members of the houses of lords and commons , not being in its own nature an oath of exclusion , but an oath of allegiance to the state , abjuring all foreign jurisdiction : and their rejection of of this oath amounts to an avowal , that they are in principle traitors to the state , in acknowledging a foreign jurisdiction . The argument by which this able senator support this opinion is , that all members of the state are by natural right entitled to an equality of political power , so far as a capability of enjoying all the honours , emoluments
