councils too , that are infinitely better authority on these points than any arguments , assertions , or garbled quotations , that have been urged in the course of this debate , to maintain that the principles of the catholics bely their oaths ; or that in taking those oaths they have exaggerated all their other crimes by the addition of perjury . I can refer , sir , to the answers given by the first catholic universities in Europe on these points , to the queries put in 1789 , at the particular instance of a right hon . gent . on that side of the house , then and now at the head of his majesty 's councils . I mean , sir , the universities of the Sorbonne at Paris , and those of Louvaine , Douay , Salamanea , and Valladolid , some of which express the highest astonishment that such opinions should in this enlightened age and country be conceived to be maintained by the catholic church , and all which deny in the most solemn manner that any such opinions ever were at any time , ancient or modern , any part of the principles of that church.â€”In the course which I have taken , you , Mr. Speaker , and the house will have observed , that I have confined myself to those objections alone , which , in the language of my right hon . and learned friend , are paramount to all the inferior circumstances of accident and locality ; and I have endeavoured to demonstrate fully ( it may be thought , I fear , too fully ) that in the first place , there is nothing in the principles of the constitution , as modified by the reformation or as settled at the revolution , which is incompatible with the unrestrained admission of the catholics to every civil right enjoyed by their protestant fellow-subjects ; and that , secondly , there is no foundation for imputing to their religion any that , secondly , there is no foundation for imputing to their religion any principle dangerous to civil society . If in these points I have sufficiently effected , what I proposed to myself , I have done all that appears to me necessary to the support of the present motion . For the question is not now , whether we shall grant the prayer of the petition in its full extent or indeed in any extent , but whether we shall discuss with the freedom only to be had in a committee , the expediency of granting the whole or any , or at the present moment , no part of the desired relief , on a detailed view , of the principles recognised in the several acts formerly passed both by the British and Irish parliaments 995 in favour of the catholics , of their adversaries , of the actual juncture of our affairs , and in short of all the considerations , by which political action is usually influenced and determined . All who think that any thing should be granted , and even all , who merely on motives of present expediency think that although nothing should be for ever denied , nothing should be now granted , ought to agree in going into a committee for the sake of that discussion ; they only can consistently vote against the motion of my hon . friend , who are fixed and resolute to oppose now and for ever against the wishes , affections , and loyalty of their catholic fellow-subjects an impassable bar , an eternal system of exclusion , an irreversible decree of political excommunication and interdict , on account of religion alone ; and against the catholics of Ireland in particular , to draw a line of everlasting separation in the outset of that union , which they had been among the most zealous to accomplish , and from which they were encouraged to entertain farther hopes and expectations . When we go into that committee , sir , as I trust we shall , let it be recollected always , that the
