is not granted ; but that misfortune I hold as bearing no comparison in extent with the mischiefs which inevitably must have ensued , if no opportunity had been allowed for a fair and full discussion of this momentous question . It will , I am sure , be respectfully entertained and deliberately discussed . The question will be placed on such grounds , that , whatever the decision of this night may be , no man will go away without the fullest conviction that the day can not be far distant when the great and important objects of the petition will be attained . But , my lords , if instead of laying it before parliament , those who brought it forward had gone back and told those from whom they had received it , that there could not be found one individual ready and willing to present their petition ; that not only the voice of parliament was against them , but that the doors of parliament were shut to their complaints—if such had unhappily been the case , I ask every considerate and temperate man , what must have been the impression on the minds of that body on whose behalf I am addressing you—what other impression could there possibly have been , but that of absolute despair ? What would it have been short of shewing the great majority of the people of Ireland , that all the expectations which were held out to them by the union were to be completely frustrated ? The effect which has been produced on their minds by receiving their petition is , that they are convinced they will have an impartial parliament , worked upon by no local prejudices , to consider their wishes with all the attention due to so numerous and respectable a class of our fellow-subjects . I have said thus much in order to vindicate myself , and explain the reasons why I am clearly of opinion , that this petition , if rejected , would have been attended with the most fatal consequences ; and also to vindicate the petitioners themselves , for the solicitude they have expressed , that their petition may be respectfully submitted to your lordships ' consideration.—And now , my lords , how shall I begin to lay before you this grave , extensive , and most important question ? My lords , I would begin with that which is the system , the fact , and foundation of the whole proceeding , but which , simply and plainly , appears to me hardly to have made the least impression on the minds of those who are averse to the petition ; I 654 mean the fact , that you have , in the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , a population consisting of 3 million according to the lowest , and of 5 million according to the highest computation , of fellow subjects , who have been brought up and educated in the catholic religion , who profess that religion , who are attached to it , and whom therefore you must consider , for every purpose of government , as persons to be treated as Roman catholics . When this question is brought before you , you are not to consider it as we in this country are apt to look at the Roman catholics , as a body of men , however respectable , small in number , and forming only an exception to the general mass of population ; but you are to consider , that in that part of the united kingdom called Ireland , three-fourths of the population are of the description of Roman catholics ; that it is impossible for you , in taking any one single step towards providing for the exigencies of government , the happiness of the people , or the various matters committed to the legislature , ever to lose sight of the fact that three-fourths of the people of Ireland are Roman catholics , and must be provided for as Roman catholics . If I am asked , whether , supposing a man could regulate the
