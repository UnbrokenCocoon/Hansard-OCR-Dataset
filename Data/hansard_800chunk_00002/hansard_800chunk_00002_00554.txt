speak of their being driven to despair , and of their groaning under long and endless oppression . Imagination often creates more sense of suffering than does reality of cause ; and we are frequently led to suppose ourselves objects of pity or disregard by the mistaken or officious suggestions of pretended sympathy . If we for a moment appreciate the real case as it is , and as it is pretended it ought to be , we shall find that no penalties or restrictions remain which can be felt by the great mass of that people , and that not the grant of all which is required , would add a grain to their real wants or wishes ; and in respect of the few who might be objects of supposed benefit by the further indulgences , they are excluded only from certain situations by necessary regard for our constitutional establishment , and from which , in fact , they exclude themselves by refusal to aspire to them upon equal conditions with their protestant fellow subjects.—In justice to the liberality of the legislature , let us estimate the value of the last concession , that of the elective franchise ! I can not conceive that a more powerful incentive to habits of industry , and thereby to acquisition of property , could have been conferred ; and it must be evident , that the competition was thus made more than equal in favour of the catholics . It ought also to be observed that a protestant legislature , part of it against its own immediate interests and convenience , made this in some degree at least , a sacrifice of the comparative superiority and even independence of the protestants , by the necessity imposed upon future candidates for parliament solicit the favour of even the lower orders of the catholic freeholders . At all events , the token of wish for harmony and good fellowship was manifested beyond a doubt . It is not imputable to the protestant legislature in depreciation of the real boon , that all the benefit to which it was 835 unquestionably conducive , was not derived from it by the objects of its participation.—Long as there shall exist the uncontrouled dominion of factious demagogues of what ever class , but especially that of the monkish priesthood over the minds of these wretched people , they will not be suffered to exert their resources with uniform and steady attention to any pursuit best calculated for their own advantage , and for the peace and prosperity of the country . And here we may reflect perhaps with regret upon the change ( to which I before alluded ) in the influence of the higher over the lower orders of the catholic community , which not only weakens the constant channel of communication with government , but disables those , who are in reality time most , if not the only petitioners immediately interested on this occasion , from strengthening their pretensions by the pledge of sure responsibility for the political conduct of the whole body.—I will not attempt to discuss the question of present relation in point of authority or subordination between the several branches of this catholic community in abstract matters of religion . This has been largely considered by other noble lords , with sufficient examination of the imperium in imperio , the catholic hierarchy . I would simply remark , that here assuredly is an instance of connivance beyond the usual cases of to legation ; and I had ventured to regard it as an ever striking proof , admitted by the catholics , of the liberal forbearance of the protestant establishment . What may be the degree of danger which , in case of an allowance of catholic power , may be incurred from temptation and resources in this quarter also to assume a more independent condition and unfettered acknowledgment , is a subject worthy of very serious reflection.—I will confess that I had persuaded myself of a remedy to all causes of uneasiness and alarm in the last great measure of an union of the kingdoms ; I did expect from
