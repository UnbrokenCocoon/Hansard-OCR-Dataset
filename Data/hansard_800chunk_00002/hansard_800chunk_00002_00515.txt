, to which at a future time , for the sake of consistency , they might think it necessary to adhere . It was a matter of satisfaction to him to think that he had been preceded nearly in the same line of opinion and conduct by two of his Majesty 's ministers ( Camden and Mulgrave ) .— He was aware that such a line of conduct might he liable to observation in debate , but he nevertheless flattered himself that it might not be unattended with advantage . He thought that it would be a matter of satisfaction to the respectable body from whom the petition came to know that they had friends on both sides of the division , and that the numbers who divided for the motion of the noble lord did not constitute the whole of their strength ; but he hoped that knowledge would not lead them hastily and prematurely to reintroduce the subject ; and that the dignified and temperate discussion which the question had received , and particularly the temper and moderation of the reverend bench , would operate as an inducement to such forbearance . stated that before their that lordships consented to resolve themselves into a committee for the purpose of considering in what manner they could best carry into execution the prayer of the petition , entitled the petition of the Roman catholics whose names were subscribed , it would surely be matter of prudence to enquire , whether the principle upon which the petition rested , was such as their lordships could with safety admit . If , in 776 this enquiry , it Should appear , that under no possible modification could the principle and substance of the petition be conceded , without danger to the establishment in church and state , their lordships hardly be disposed to employ their time and talents in devising , the best possible means for the downfal of both . What then was the history , and what the substance of the petition ? The archbishop could not help considering the petition as the consequence , and natural consequence , of a long series of concessions , obtained by the Roman catholics of Ireland , during the present reign : of which series , the subject matter of the petition , if granted , would assuredly not constitute the ultimate term . His grace begged to be distinctly understood as in no degree calling into question the wisdom of those concessions . Many of them , in his judgment , were absolutely necessary , most of them extremely reasonable , and perhaps all of them in policy expedient . The archbishop , adverting to them , wished only to discover the causes that had led to the petition in its present form . The Roman catholics had obtained all that belonged to toleration ; and it was not to be wondered at , that , they should desire , at least , the acquisition of power.—After the 18th of his majesty , which removed from the Roman catholics the restraints that affected the grant and acceptance of leases , and provided against the consequences of the conformity of the son with the established church , so far as those consequences concerned the estates of the Roman catholic parent ; blotting for ever from the Irish statute books , that corrupt and unhallowed motive of conversion : after the 22d of his majesty , which enabled the Roman catholic , on taking the oath of allegiance , to purchase and dispose of lands in like manner as his majesty 's protestant subjects ; and on the same terms , freed the ecclesiastic of that persuasion from the pains , and penalties of former acts : after the statute of the same year , authorising Roman catholics to teach schools , and giving new facilities to the guardianship of Roman catholic children : after the 32d of his majesty , which removed disqualifications from lawyers and attornies of that persuasion , sanctioned the intermarriages of protestants with Roman catholics , and repealed laws that prohibited foreign , and embarrassed domestic education : after
