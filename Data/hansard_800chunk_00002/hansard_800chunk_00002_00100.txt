An account shewing the numbers and tonnage of shipping which have been built in the merchants ' yards of G. Britain , between the 1st Jan. 1793 , and the 31st Dec. 1804 , or as late as the same can be made out , by the returns at the customhouse . '' From this it would appear , that in the merchant yards nearly 100,000 tons per year , exclusive of the ships of war on contract , have been built.—Next for `` An account , shewing the number of ships and vessels of each class in the royal navy , and their tonnage ; the foreign built ships to be distinctly stated , and those which have been built in the merchant-yards from those which have been built in the king 's yards . '' From this account it would appear , that the whole navy amounts to about 530,000 tons ; of which about 114,000 tons have been taken from the enemy , and about 260,000 tons built by contract : only 156,000 tons have been built in the king 's yards , although they contain 3000 shipwrights , besides apprentices.—He would next move for 151 `` Copies of all letters and representations which have passed between the admiralty and the navy boards , and between these boards , and the master shipwrights of his majesty 's dock-yards , or any other person since the 27th Oct. 1803 , on the subject of shoaling the shipwrights . '' Repeated representations had been made on the impropriety of the system pursued in working the shipwrights in the king 's yards , which the late admiralty had endeavoured to correct.—He would also move for `` Copies of all letters which have passed between the navy board and the master shipwrights of the several dock-yards , since the 1st of June 1804 , respecting the time when the ships ordered to be built in his majesty 's yards can be completed . '' This would shew , that if the men were properly shoaled , and not detained , by the want of materials , there would be no occasion to employ the merchant builders.—His next motion would be for `` A statement shewing the number of shipwrights that should build a 74-gun ship of 1730 tons in one year , to be entitled , according to the prices for workmanship allowed by the present scheme of task , to three days pay for one , or 6s . 3d . per diem . '' At the rate of 6s . 3d . per day , the present wages , 48 shipwrights should build a 74-gun ship , of 1730 tons , in one year , or 312 days ; and the whole sum for workmanship would amount to 46711.—His two next would be for `` A list of ships which have been launched from his majesty 's dock-yards , between the 1st of Jan. 1793 , and 31st of Dec . 1804 . '' Also , `` An account shewing the number of shipwrights borne in all the yards , on the 31st of Dec. of each year , from 1793 to 1804 inclusive ; the sums paid to them for wages in each year , and the number of ships of 74 guns , and 1730 tons , which the sums so paid in each year would pay for the workmanship in building , according to the prices allowed by the present scheme of task . '' In the 9 years prior to 1802 , only 11 ships of the line , 2 fifties , 14 frigates , and 4 sloops had been launched in the king 's yards , and money has been actually equal to the building of 523 sail of the line.—His next would be `` For a statement of the grounds upon which the merchant ship builders declined to contract with the Navy Board for the building of ships of 74 guns , at a lower price than 361. per ton , such parts thereof to be distinctly stated as were adduced at the time they made their first offer , and 152 the
