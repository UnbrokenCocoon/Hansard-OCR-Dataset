and strongly participate in the sentiment which so generally pervades all ranks of 378 his majesty 's faithful subjects , of the wisdom and fidelity with which it has discharged its most sacred trust , by the progress it has made towards protecting the people against such gross violations of the law and breaches of public duty ; and that the petitioners approach the house , as the guardians of the liberty and property of the people , under a full conviction that such shameful abuses will induce the house to do ample justice to the outraged feelings of the country , by bringing to condign punishment convicted criminality ; and that they beg to submit to the house , that it would be highly derogatory to his majesty 's government , prejudicial to the public service , and insulting to the house , and the nation at large , for lord Melville any longer to continue in his majesty 's councils , or to hold any place of trust , profit , or honour , in or under the government ; and that they conceive all other persons who may be implicated in , or who have connived at , such abuses , to be incapable any longer of serving the country with honour or advantage , and ought equally to be brought to a severe account ; and therefore praying , that the house , taking these matters into their most serious consideration , will vigorously promote and prosecute those inquiries , and cause the powers of the said commissioners to be prolonged and extended , and other measures to be adopted , in order that such further enquiry may be made into the receipt , management , and expenditure of the public money , and the conduct of the public offices , as may lead to the detection of all abuses and the punishment of all offences , and that such a system of vigilance and economy may be established , as may effectually guard against the recurrence of such flagrant abuses . '' presented a petition from the mayor and coproration of the city of Salisbury , setting forth , `` That the petitioners have perused , with much concern and interest , the resolutions of the house of the 8th and 10th days of this instant April ; with concern , that any charges of the nature therein implied should attach upon any individual in a high official situation , and with interest , that the representatives of the nation have , under the circumstance of such charges , marked such individual with their censure and reprobation ; and that the petitioners beg leave to state , that , in common with the nation at large , they 379 have to lament the weight of the heavy burthens to which the legislature has found it necessary to submit them , but they claim to themselves , in common with the nation at large , the merit of having borne them with patience , readiness , and equanimity , trusting that what had been granted liberally would be applied faithfully ; but when a suspicion is gone forth , under the authority of parliamentary commissioners , and that suspicion apparently adopted by the house , that peculation has been hard at work , the petitioners take leave to call upon the national representatives for redress , reminding them that it is of little consequence as a public grievance , of little consequence in point of official morality whether the actual peculation be by men of great authority and power , or by their deputies and subalterns under their permission and connivance ; and therefore praying the house to continue such commission of enquiry as has already discovered such abuses , and to institute any new commission which may be necessary to ascertain whether in any other department of the state the national finances have been misapplied , and also to devise such legal proceedings upon those instances of misapplication already before the public as may satisfy the general cry for justice , by bringing all persons concerned to a strict responsibility .
