a libel as this is before the house , I certainly do think this a more serious libel than many others , and confess that it has made a stronger impression on me for exactly the reason that has been stated , of its not being in favour of my own side of the question ; not however , because I am myself indivi- 443 dually concerned , but because I think that libels are much more serious when they are most agreeable to the executive power ; for , in that case , there are strong suspicions that they may possibly come from those who receive the pay of the goverment . defended the sentiments which be had formerly expressed , but spoke so low , that we could not follow him in the particulars.â€”The motion was then put , and carried without a division . Mr. Atkins Wright then moved , `` that Mr. P. Stuart be called to the bar , reprimanded , and discharged . '' observed , that if it was the general sense of the house that a libel of this nature should be passed over in this manner , he had no objection to the motion . He was of opinion , however , that when the house interfered , its sentence ought to be something heavy . The paragraph in question had been voted a high breach of privilege by the house , and the author ought therefore to meet with some marks of the displeasure of the house .

In 1795 , government had thought proper to give orders to seize neutral vessels going to France with provisions . These vessels and the cargoes had been consigned , after a part of the provisions had been taken for the use of government , with the remaining cargoes to Mr. Claude Scott , to be disposed of for the public account . He was informed that the produce of the sale , amounting to two hundred thousand pounds , had been suffered to remain in the hand 's of Mr. Scott , down to the year 1800 . During this period , Mr. Scott had frequently supplied government with corn to a large amount , which there was reason to suppose he
