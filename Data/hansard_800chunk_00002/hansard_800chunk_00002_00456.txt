been equally , tranquil and equally safe in what we refused and what 688 we granted . My , lords , the conduct of myself , and of those with Whom I have acted , will prove that we have been at all times friends to a mild and conciliatory exercise of the laws in Ireland : but whilst I state this to have been our opinion and our practice , I must be allowed to say that I have formed a very erroneous judgment of the character of the people of Ireland , if have not learned that that policy which in my judgment is most compatable with mild laws , namely , a steady system of government , is the best chance you can have for the internal peace and tranquility of that country . The maxims which I have adduced in support of our established laws , are neither new in themselves , nor confined to the country in which we have the blessing of being born ; they are the maxims and principles which have been hitherto adopted by every free community of Europe , as well in ancient as in modern times . It has been till within these few years a principle uniformly recognized , that the state and the established religion of a country must be connected ; and that those who possess political power in the former , owe a certain degree of obedience and homage to the latter . If look to the ancients , I find that , in the republic of Athens , no citizen could take a share in the civil administration , or enter upon any public office before he had taken an oath that he would defend and protect his country and its religion , and that he would conform to then national worship . In the republic of Rome , the great civil and military officers could only be appointed through the concurrent sanction of the established rights ; â€”without the due performance of these , the appointments were not good , the parties were said to be vitio creati , and they lost their situations . If I look to modern times , I find that , in the republic of Holland , the principal offices of the state could only be holden by those who professed the established religion of the country . In the government of Poland , ( a limited monarchy in principle , however vicious it might be in practice , ) the same maxim was entertained and acted upon . Similar principles will be found to have pervaded almost all the free governments of and I know not how I can better sum up what was understood to be the system and practice of Europe in this respect , than in the words of our glorious deliverer , king William ; who , when applied to by king James , on the subject of indulgence to the catholics ; made , through Mr. Fagel , the following answer : `` Their 689 highnesses ever had a profound submission to his majesty ; but since the matter that was then in hand , related not to the making of new laws , but to the total abrogation of those already made both by king and parliament , their highnesses did not see how it could be expected of them , that they should consent to such an abrogation , to which they had so just an aversion ; as being a thing contrary to all the laws and customs of all Christian states , whether protestants or papists , who admitted none to a share in the government or public employments , but those who professed the public and established religion , and endeavoured to secure it against all attempts whatsoever . '' There are , I know , two most important exceptions , in recent times , to this policy : the first is to be found in the conduct of the national assembly of France , who proclaimed the equality of all religions ; which was only a prelude to the destruction of every description of religion in
