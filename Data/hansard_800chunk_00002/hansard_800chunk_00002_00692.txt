; thought jacobin principles were the foundation of the rebellion , yet I do not mean to deny , that the influence of the priests , themselves tainted with jacobin principles , might not have aggravated the evil , though they were not the cause of it . My idea , sir . was not to apply tests to the religious tenets of the catholics , but tests applicable to what was the source and foundation of the evil , to render the priests , instead of making them the instruments of poisoning the minds of the people , dependent in some sort upon the government , and thus links , as it were , between the government and the-people . That , sir , Would have been a wise and a comprehensive system ; that would have been the system which I should have felt it to be my wish , and thought it to have been my duty , to have proposed . I never thought that it would have been wise or prudent to have thrown down rudely or abruptly the guards and fences of the constitution ; but I did think , that if the system I have alluded to had been deemed proper to be adopted , it ought to have been accompanied with those checks and guards , and with every regulation that could have given additional respect and influence to the established church , to the support and protection of the protestant interests , and to the encouragement of every measure that could tend to propagate and spread the example of the protestant religion . These were the general views and intentions . I entertained . And if , sir , it had been pos- 1017 sible to have found that general concurrence which I so anxiously , desired ; if I could have carried them into effect its the manner I have stated ; if persons of more ability and experience than myself would have digested them , I am still inclined to think , that instead of being attended with those dangerous consequences which some gentlemen apprehend , they would have afforded increased security to the church , and have been favourable to the welfare of the state , to the stability of the constitution , and to the general strength and interest of the empire.—But when I state this , sir , I must also remind the house , that I considered the period of the union as the period favourable for the adoption of such a measure ; not because any pledge had been given , but because there was a greater likelihood that the measure might be adopted after the union than before it . The period was favourable also on another account ; favourable from the recent impressions that might be expected to be made on men 's minds , of the probability a increased security from the union ; from being amalgamated and incorporated with the imperial legislature , remote from the dangerous influence that might at times be supposed to operate upon , and overawe the local legislature of Ireland . Sir , I repeat , that it under the recent impression of these circumstances I could have brought forward the measure as the first fruits of the union , I should have hoped there might have been a disposition to have received it Without rekindling those religious animosities , or reviving those contending interests , between catholic and protestant , which , whenever they do exist , are most adverse to the welfare , the prosperity , and the happiriess of the state . This , sir , was the view in which I considered this most important subject ; these were the objects which I wished to attain ; but circumstances , unfortunate circumstances in my opinion , rendered it at that period impossible to bring forward the measure in the way in which I then hoped it might be practicable to bring it forward—in the only way in which I think it ought at any time to be brought forward—in the only way in which it could be brought forward , With
