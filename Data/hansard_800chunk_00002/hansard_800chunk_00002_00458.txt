that if the church owes its existence to the protection of the state , the constitution owes not less its existence to the support it has occasionlly , met with from the church . In the reign of Charles the First , the party who meditated and ultimately accomplished the ruin of the monarchy , meditated at the same time , and equa1ly accomplished , the ruin of the church establishment they fell together , and at the restoration they rose again together . In the beginning of the reign to 691 Charles the Second when the tide ran high in favour of monarchy , the only resistance which was made to that prince for some years , was made by the church party ; and to their opposition at that time , we were indebted for the preservation of any part of our political liberties . I come then to the revolution : and let me ask any person acquainted with the history of that period , whether the zeal of the whigs for liberty could have effected it , if they had not been aided , seconded , and abetted by the zeal of the tories for the established church ? —I call not therefore upon any one of the great parties into which this country has been divided ; I call upon them all , for support this night ; I call upon the whigs , who have ever gloried in the lead which they took in the revolution of 1688 , who have ever considered themselves as the principal promoters of the bill of rights and act of settlement ; I call upon them to support the system of King Williams , and the laws enacted under his auspices ; I call upon the tories , the firm , steady , and persevering supporters of the monarchy and the established church ; I call upon them to maintain those laws which are the bulwarks of these establishments . The question between me and the noble baron , is shortly this ; —he desires you , for the reasons which he has stated , to repeal your test laws ; to repeal your corporation acts ; nay , to repeal the bill of rights , and act of settlement , in some of its most important stipulations . I implore you to cherish the laws under which you have lived and prospered , to cling to that policy which , in my conscience I believe , has made you what you are , and under which you have , enjoyed liberty , toleration , wealth , tranquillity beyond whatever was enjoyed by any country on the face of the earth . Avoid rash innovations shun new experiments : the future destiny of our country is not in own hands ; kingdoms may rise and fall , flourish or decay ; but let us not be ourselves the instruments of that blow which may occasion our destruction ; let us not despise the wisdom of our ancestors , nor forget the dangers which they have averted ! Let us reflect that all past experience and all authority is in favour of our laws , and that it is only by a steady adherence to that system which we have received from our forefathers , and a firm determination to transmit it to our descendants , that we can hope to exist with credit , or to fall ( if we must fall ) with honour . Impressed with these considerations ; fully convinced that the propo- 692 sition of the noble lord leads to the repeal of those laws which are the foundation all our happiness , security , and prosperity ; satisfied that the advantages which he expects to arise from the repeal of them , would not be gained , and that the best interests of the country would be exposed to the most serious danger ; I deprecate his experiment ; and I shall therefore give my negative to referring the petition to a committee . —My lords : after the very able manner in which my noble friend has explained to this house ,
