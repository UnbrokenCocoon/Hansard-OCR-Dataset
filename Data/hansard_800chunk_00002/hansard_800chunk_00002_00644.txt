a power possibly greater than any possessed by the state , from its general diffusion , unsuspected influence , and extensive consequences : add to these considerations , the recollection of confiscated property , the long series of injuries alleged to have been committed by the English against the Irish , the remembrance of which has been constantly kept alive by tradition , and by recent exaggerated statements ; and the well-known historical fact , that claims to property can not fail for want of hereditary succession , as , by the Brehon law , it , exists not in individuals , but in the name and Sept ; and the house will see the reasons and motives for that dislike to British connexion , which ever has , and still continues to influence the lower and more numerous part of the catholics of Ireland , a peasantry directed by a clergy generally ignorant in every point but their school-divinity , all influenced by common motives of action , irreconcileable to British connexion at present ; under such circumstances , though we can not anticipate what growing wealth and more diffused intercourse may hereafter effect , we must still be on our guard . For these reasons I consider a knowledge of the doctrines of the see of Rome , and their actual influence upon the Irish clergy and the Irish catholics , as a most serious subject of consideration upon this occasion . As long as these prejudices and habits continue to influence their people , I am convinced no good effect can result from concessions . I am equally convinced that the better informed , the nobility and gentry , feel too many advantages resulting from their present situation , not to act with the utmost loyalty , and many , I admit , have already distinguished themselves by their conduct . But it would be reasoning like novelists , and not like statesmen , to make the great fundamental principles of a con- 948 stitution like that of this mighty empire , bend so far , as to sacrifice its bulwarks in exchange for the strength expected to be derived from the gratification of the feelings of a few individuals ; those new doctrines which teach a man to forget all he owes to the laws , the constitution , and the king ; all that he owes to his family , his property , and his honour , if checked or controled in the pursuit of objects which he may be taught to over-value ; and I lament that such loyalty is represented as only to be of retained and secured by the sacrifice of our constitution ! The numbers of the Irish catholics have been stated with a double object , to describe them as a source of strength , if conciliated , and of terror , if not gratified in their demands . If the higher classes of the catholics have influence , and have not hitherto exerted it , they can have no claims upon the confidence or gratitude f the legislature ; but if ( as I believe the case to be ) they possess no power when opposed to the passions of the inferior people and the interested exertions of their clergy , I consider the yielding to their claims , a sacrifice of the constitution for a most trivial consideration . On more general grounds , the introduction into parliament and the cabinet of a certain number of the catholics , heading and acting as the organ of the catholic people , might be productive of the most fatal consequences ; divisions might arise among the protestants , and a misguided monarch might attempt to obtain powers incompatible with the safety of our church and state , by the aid and : support of that catholic party or interest . Such views were imputed to Charles the First ; such conduct was certainly adopted by James the Second ; and of that misguided effort we only escaped the fatal consequences , by placing the present royal family on the throne . The concessions now sought might also prove fatal to
