, respecting commissions , exchanges , and promotions in the army ; consequently another thing to be laid out of the present consideration , is all that concerns mere recommendations to offices or emoluments not in the army , nor within the Duke 's patronage , otherwise than as they may tend to throw any light on the question before us . Having thus laid aside these extraneous matters , my next step was to separate , and throw aside , so much of the evidence as is mere hearsay , or of such other description as ought not to be received on any judicial proceeding . As there is much of this , if I should be asked why I neglected to object to it , when it was offered at the bar , my answer is this : the house , or the committee , whenever it is sitting as the grand inquest of the nation , has to pursue two objects : one , to examine and record proper evidence produced before it ; the other , to exert all due means of discovering and acquiring proper evidence ; and this latter can not be executed without asking questions of hearsay , and such others as may lead to the procurement of proper witnesses . It must therefore always remain a subsequent task to separate the chaff from the grain , and to strike out so much of the testimony as ought not to be received . I do not mean according to technical rules , but according to sound principles of justice . The next endeavour was to disencumber the case from the testimony of such of the 29 witnesses as , however competent or admissible they may be , are nevertheless entitled to no belief : an investigation this , of some labour , the persons examined at the bar being no fewer in number than seventy-eight . Of all the witnesses it is required that they should speak the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ; but of none is it more peculiarly expected than of such as appear in the light of accomplices ; and it may not be useless that I should here state , what I take to be an undeniable rule respecting persons of that description . It is , that no man should ever be convicted of any of the higher crimes , upon the testimony of accomplices , unless they show themselves worthy of credit by consistency with themselves , and unless they are continued by other evidence not simply in their history of the offence , but particularly in that link of it which connects the offence with the person accused ; for without this indispensable ingredient , no man could be safe . Whenever an offence has been committed , the accomplice must necessarily know the whole transaction . If , therefore , he be desirous to accuse an innocent man , he would have nothing to do but to tell his tale according to the truth , except in the substitution of the innocent person for the guilty , and his end might be accomplished— Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur.— Suppose , for instance , a murder or burglary perpetrated by two or three , one of whom is admitted king 's evidence , and either to screen if friend , or to revenge himself against an enemy , he accuses an innocent person in the stead of one of his guilty companions ; he has only to relate the crime just as it was committed , and in all probability he will be confirmed in many of the circumstances . The time , the place , the number , the noises , the stolen goods , and so forth , are likely to be confirmed , because they correspond with the truth ; but if it were to be inferred from hence , that he spoke the truth also in naming the partner in his guilt , without evidence to corroborate that particular point of his testimony , many an innocent man must lose his life , unless
