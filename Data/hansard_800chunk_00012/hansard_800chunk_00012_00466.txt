gent . the Master of the Rolls , and that giving it as he did upon full conviction , he had `` come honestly by that conviction , '' but this he would not attempt to do in the present temper of the house.â€” He would however beg the house to be upon its guard against being led step by step into conclusions not in their contemplation . The Chancellor of the Exchequer had recommended his proposition by assuring them that , even after voting it , they might address the throne either for the removal of his royal highness , or for his continuance in office . But should they , in a manner so decisive acquit his royal highness , not only of corrupt practices , but even of the remotest connivance at those practices , with what propriety or consistency could they then address the king for his removal ? He must give his negative to the proposition of the Chancellor of the Exchequer as it now stood and should be glad if the amendment of the hon . baronet were drawn so as to admit of the distinction proposed by Mr. Bankes , but should the hon . baronet persist in his amendment he could not withhold his assent from it , believing it , as he did , to be made out by the evidence .

The question then before the house was the most important branch , though not the whole of the case ; but unless the house should entertain it with patience , they would not get out of the business with the same credit to which their past proceedings were entitled . The motion of the noble lord he must observe , had not arisen from any wish to interrupt the discussion ; but had been forced upon him by the impatience of the house ; he should not therefore propose to negative that motion , as he honed the noble lord would with draw it , and then he trusted that the house would pay that attention to the sentiments of gentlemen who might be disposed to take a part in the debate , which the importance of the subject merited . had no objection to withdraw his motion , if the house was disposed to attend with patience and temper to the discussion . meant not to object to the withdrawing of the noble lord 's motion , but to urge to the house the propriety , from personal consideration for the Speaker , of abstaining from any course by which the fatigues to which he was subjected might be increased .
