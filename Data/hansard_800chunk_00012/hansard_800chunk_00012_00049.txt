of further inquiry . Ludowick Orramin , who is proved , not only by himself , but by Pierson the butler , to be the only servant ever permitted by h.r.h . to come to Gloucester-Place , denies having changed that , or any other note . To contradict his evidence , Mr. Pierson is called by the hon . gent . I am sorry to be under the necessity of dragging the house through the detail of Mr. Pierson 's evidence , but it is much too important a part of the case to be left imperfectly stated . He was Mrs. C. 's butler . He recollects the time when she went to Worthing , and the Duke to Weymouth , in 1805 . He is asked , `` Whether he recollects Ludowick , the servant , who used to attend the Duke , being ordered by the Duke , on an evening about that period , to take a note out and get it changed ? '' He answered , `` I DO NOT . '' `` Do you recollect any servant being ordered by the Duke to get a bank note changed ? '' His Answer is , `` I recollect Mrs . Favorite , the house-keeper , bringing down a bill in the morning , and Ludowick going out and getting it changed , and coming back and giving it to Mrs . Favorite again , and she took it up stairs . '' `` Do you recollect any servant being ordered by the Duke to get a bank note changed ? '' — '' No . '' `` Do you recollect any servant taking out a bank note to be changed ? `` — '' Yes , I do , on a morning . '' `` Did you hear him ordered to do so by any body ? `` — '' The housekeeper gave him the note , I saw her give him the note , and he took it out . '' `` Do you know the amount of the note ? `` — '' No , I do not . '' `` Do you recollect what order she gave , in what words ? '' `` No , I do mot , in particular , what order she gave , but she gave him a note , and he was to go and get it changed . '' `` Are you positive that that note was not given on the night , and the change brought back in 88 the morning ? `` — '' I am positive , I saw it given . '' `` Was h. r. h. the D. of York in Mrs. C. 's house at the time this note was given to Ludowick to get changed ? `` — '' Yes , he was up stairs . '' Now , I trust the house recollects that the fact in Mrs. C. 's evidence , which this witness was called to confirm , is , that the identical note of 200l . which she received from Mr. Knight in the morning of the 31st of July , was changed by the Duke 's servant , on the night of that day , on which h. r. h. left town for Weymouth ; Mrs. C. leaving town at 4 o'clock on the following morning for Worthing . But this witness knows nothing of the note changed on that or any other night ; he recollects only the changing of a note on some morning , the amount of which he does not recollect , but which could not by possibility have been the note which Mrs. C. speaks of ; and therefore , Pierson 's evidence , instead of confirming Mrs. Clarke 's , as far as it goes , contradicts her . He is asked , `` How long was it before Mrs. C. went to Worthing ; was it the day before , or two days before , or three days before ? `` — '' I do not recollect exactly , but it was a short time before she went to Worthing . '' Now ,
