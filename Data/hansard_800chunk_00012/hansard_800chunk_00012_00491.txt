this house over the people , depends on the due vindication of this vital principle , so I am persuaded our present venerable sovereign is too enlightened at present not to feel that the security of the crown in his illustrious family is no less eventually interested in it . His majesty , born and bred in this country , having filled its throne near half a century , must know the mighty share 721 this house must have in tempering and regulating the feelings of the people of England : he must know that the crown of this country stands not on , superstition or an armed force , but on the more permanent support of a conviction in the minds of an immense majority of its inhabitants , that monarchy , limited as it is by the constitution , is the form of government best calculated to afford the enjoyment of rational liberty which has been devised by the wit of man during the progress of successive ages . As long as the sober part of the community shall be satisfied that their representatives will vindicate the privileges of this house , by animadverting on the abuse of the prerogative of the crown , as the case may require , so long will it be able to be a barrier against wild democracy . Much has been said , in the course of the present debates , on the members of this house yielding to popular clamour , while others assert that it is deaf to the voice of the people . If I am not mistaken in the object of the cunning artificers of the British constitution , their view was to give the people due weight with the government of the country , and at the same time to avoid those evils which have afflicted all governments where the people individually decided on public measures , as was the case in the Athenian and the latter periods of the Roman Republics . The anarchy , oppression , and bloodshed which prevailed in those unhappy states are as well known to the enlightened body of men , which compose a British House of Commons , as it is that foreign conquest and internal despotism were the sequel of that state of things . Anarchy begets despotism , which is again followed by oppression ; oppression begets resistance and revolution , and they thus succeed each other in a perpetual round . To avoid these evils , and at the same time give the people their due weight , our artificers devised their chusing representatives from among themselves , over whom they must have great influence , but who , being at the same time almost universally men , whose circumstances in life have exempted from the necessity of bodily labour , have had leisure to acquire the advantages of education and reflection , which the situation of the lower class of mankind will not admit . An assemblage of men of this description , though they will have the people always in view , will also think it their duty to stem the intemperance which a mass of well meaning but uneducated men may be apt to run into . He is 722 not more unworthy to be a representative of the people , who acts always at the nod of the crown , than he who conducts himself always arbitrio popularis aurÂ™ . What is called a tool of the crown is not more dangerous to the happiness of the people than he who is a pander to their passions . They will both betray what they were sent here to protect , and are equally foreign to what it was intended a representative of the people should be . In this view of the duty of a member of parliament , I should have voted for the Resolutions proposed by the right hon . gentleman ( Mr. Bathurst ) , in the persuasion that on the affirmative of these Resolutions by this house it was impossible the royal Duke could continue in office , and I considered his relinquishing that great trust as an amende
