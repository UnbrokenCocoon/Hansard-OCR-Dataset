however I may have a preference of one over the other . I speak , of course , of the forms of proceeding , not of the opinions , by which they may be accompanied or intended to ; be followed , with all of which it will not be possible to concur , because many , of them are in contradiction with each other . There is , however , a higher and more general question of proceeding , paramount 495 to those just enumerated , which it will be necessary previously to discuss , and which I shall endeavour to explain.â€”There seems to be an intention of calling upon the house to resolve the great subject before them into certain issuable points upon which separate decisions should be taken , and then upon the decisions so taken , and as a consequence derived from them , to ground an Address , expressing the opinion of the house as to what ought further to be done . However plausible this may sound , and however true it may be , that such is the course , which each individual will pursue in forming his opinion , I am clear that , as a mode of judging to be adopted by this house , or by any other tribunal consisting of numerous members , it is as little true in theory , as it is conformable to general and established practice . With respect to practice , it is obvious , that it is not in this way that the house determines the numerous complicated questions that are continually coming before it . For the purpose here considered , it is of no consequence , whether the question is of a judicial nature or of any other . The laws of reasoning and the rules by which one truth is deduced from another , are the same in all subjects . A question of peace and war may involve in it a great variety of subordinate questions , such as , Whether the war projected is consistent with the good faith of the country , and with subsisting treaties , whether it is consistent with its commercial interests , is likely to prove conducive to its object , & c. & c. Yet the house does not come to a separate decision upon these points , and then from these separate decisions , derive its general conclusion upon the whole . It goes at once to the general conclusion , leaving to each man to adjust in his own mind the value to be attached to each of these separate considerations . In fact , in the very plan now proposed , we 110 sooner lay down the principle , than we feel ourselves compelled the moment afterwards to abandon it : for if we did not , when we are deciding the question of guilty or not of participation , & c. , we must say , guilty or not of participation in the case of San-don , in the case of Knight , and so on in each case to which the question of participation can apply . I protest , therefore , against the whole of this mode of proceeding , and declare beforehand , that should it be adopted by the house , and should I concur , as I certainly shall , in acquitting the Duke of York of participation or connivance , I 496 shall not feel myself precluded from taking into account , the presumptions established in those very charges , cu which t have so acquitted him , in deciding upon the general question , of Whether or no the Duke of York should be advised to withdraw ( or the king be advised to remove him , ) from the situation of Commander in Chief ? When I shall have pronounced a verdict of acquittal on all and every one of these charges , I shall have said nothing , that would be inconsistent with the opinion , that the Duke ought , notwithstanding , and with respect to those very charges , no longer to remain in his situation at
