He began by shortly stating to the house , what had been the result of the experiment of last year . There were at present 250 regiments of Local Militia—of these 184 regiments were for England , amounting to 149,440 men , and 66 regiments were for Scotland , amounting to 45,721 men , making together a force of 195,161 men . The 250 regiments would then be rated at an average of 800 rank and file for every regiment ; of these 125,000 men volunteered into the Local Militia , the remainder had been established by what were called Volunteers under the Act , those who had voluntarily entered the Local Militia without having been in any former corps ; to the 125,000 before-mentioned there might be added for the volunteers under the Act 50 or 60,000 men . Now , according to the plan of last year , each of the volunteers under the act received an additional bounty of two guineas per man , but owing to the strong representations which had been made to government from different parts of Great Britain , particularly from Scotland , where the assessments on the parishes were felt to be peculiarly heavy , it has been thought advisable to do away that bounty of two guineas , and leave it to the separate districts voluntarily to assess themselves at any rate not exceeding one guinea per man . Another consideration that made this alteration less objectionable was , that it did not appear that there was any necessity for this bounty , in order to encourage the volunteering into the Militia . It would therefore be one of the objects of the Bill he should move for , to abolish that
