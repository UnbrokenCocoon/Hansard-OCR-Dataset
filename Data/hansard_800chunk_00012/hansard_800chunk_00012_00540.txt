noble barons adverted . There evidently was of late years , in consequence of the unprecedented increase of the commerce , wealth , and internal prosperity of the empire , such an increase and accumulation of legislative acts and regulations , of more or less importance or necessity , as unavoidably to afford less time for the detailed consideration or discussion of each particular measure ; and this was an unavoidable consequence . In the present session , their lordships would have to consider that the other house of parliament was engaged so closely , for an unexpectedly great 795 length of time , in the discussion of a topic of a very different nature from those which ordinarily came under its consideration , so much so as to leave , comparatively , very little time for deliberation upon measures which it was necessary , from circumstances , should be adopted at an early period of the session . With respect to the accumulation of legislative acts , to which he had referred , it perhaps admitted of some degree of remedy , by merely adhering to the principle of generalization instead of particularization , and of avoiding to interpose legislatively , except in cases of commensurate necessity . This was a principle which he would wish to see more acted upon than it was of late years ; and as to the inconveniences of which the noble lords complained , he agreed with them , they were such as called for as extensive a degree of remedy as was practicable , and for his own part he would willingly assist and co-operate with any noble lord in endeavouring to counterac the evil . approved of the sentiments expressed by the noble Secretary of State , towards the close of his observations ; he fully agreed with what was said by his noble friends near him on the subject of so serious a grievance ; but he could not avoid remarking the silence of the noble lord as to the circumstance of such a large portion of the bills passed should have been suffered to take place in the last three weeks of the last session . in explanation , enforced his former remarks . He agreed in much of what fell from the noble secretary of state , particularly as to the great increase of the wealth and commerce of the empire , a consideration which , perhaps , could not be better exemplified than in the circumstance , that in the year 1761 only twenty-nine public bills were passed ; and in the last four weeks of the present session , no fewer than seventy-five bills passed the legislature . As noble lords seemed to coincide with him that something was proper to be attempted in the way of remedy , he would move for the appointment of a committee to inquire into the number of public and private Acts which have passed through both houses of parliament within a given period , and to report their opinions thereon to the house . however he acknowledged the propriety of endeavouring to apply some remedy to the inconveniences complained of , begged the noble lords to recollect that it was of the most serious 796 importance to consider what that remedy should be ; and he trusted his noble friend would not press such a motion as he had notified , at present , but afford time to noble lords to consider more maturely upon the subject . suggested , as one part of a remedy so much to be desired , that parliament should be assembled earlier in the winter , and not prorogued until near the end of January , which obliged it to keep sitting during some of the hot months of summer . After some further conversation between the earl of Liverpool , lord Grenville , and lord Auckland , the latter consented not to press his intended motion at present . requested leave , before their lordships proceeded to the order of the day , to address a few observations to the house , and to submit a proposition which he deemed of great
