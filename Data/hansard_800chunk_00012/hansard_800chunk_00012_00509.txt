seven years . Mr. Cuthbert 's accounts , ending in March 1785 , amounted to £ 1,024,526 . Strange to say , but it is too true , and proves the necessity of the resolution I am about to propose , these accounts were not settled until twenty two years after their being closed . The honourable Bazil Cochrane 's account , involving the sum of £.1,418,236 not settled accounts , have been eighteen and twenty years ready for the Board 's decision , and not yet passed . Between the period of the 9th Dec. 1806 , and the 18lh May 1807 , six Cash Accounts have been passed , which reduces the imprests to £.9s , 8d . exclusive of about 177 uncleared Imprests or promiscuous Accounts of old date from 1774 to December 1791 . Foreign Agents Store Accounts in arrear from 1779 . Home Agents and Store Keepers Store Accounts in arrear from 1785 . It also appears that Store Accounts have been ready fur the Board 's decision from seventeen to 748 twenty years , and not yet passed . Additional arrears of Store Accounts at the places undermentioned . spoke at considerable length , in answer to the hon . baronet . He said that he should be totally at a loss to understand the real object of the honourable baronet 's motion from his speech this night , if he had not heard the conversations both within and without those walls which had their origin in the suggestions of the hon . baronet , and were calculated to throw blame on the present Board of Admiralty . This , he conceived to be the true motive of the hon . baronet for wishing now to enter upon the Journals of the house the Resolution which he proposed ; the truth of which no man could deny , and which was the very ground laid for what the present Board of Admiralty had done , towards the very system of Reform in the Naval Department , now urged by the hon . baronet . He must , therefore , be excused from imputing the motion of the hon . ba- 749 ronet merely to the motives he avowed . He must call things by their right names , and freely avow his own conviction , that the true object of the hon . baronet 's motion was to cast an indirect censure on the Board of Admiralty ; and , therefore , ; without dissenting from the truth of the Resolution , he would oppose it by the previous question . It would have been more honourable and manly to name the persons to whose appointments He had objected , and thereby give to the friends of those gentlemen the opportunity of defending them fairly and openly . The hon . member then named severally the different members of the Victualling Board , to whose characters he paid high encomiums , and wished the hon . baronet to state to which , if to any of them , he could personally object . The persons at shut Board against whom he conceited the honourable baronet 's motion chiefly directed , were col. Welsh and eapt . Stuart , and this for no other cause than that they were military men , and therefore in ( he hon . baronet 's estimation unfit to sit at the Victualling Board . He ( Mr. Ward ) however conceived that military experience was us necessary as naval experience to the efficiency of that Board ; inasmuch as ever since the year 1793 , by a new arrangement of the Board , with increased salaries , additional clerks , and the appointment of a Military Inspector of Provisions , the duty of purchasing victualling stores for the army in foreign stations , as well as for the navy , devolved upon them , although the victualling of both branches no the public force was carried on under distinct departments , was different in Kind , and distributed differently on shipboard , and in garrison . The Commissioners of Revision had said there should be some military and some
