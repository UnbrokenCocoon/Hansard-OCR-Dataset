letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , announcing his resignation , does not allude to any effect produced on his mind by what has passed here on this subject ; but it is plain his advisers saw what would have been the consequence if he had not resigned , and that , had not the house thus shewed itself , a resignation would not have taken place ; but actions are more emphatic than words . The fact of the resignation establishes this salutary truth , that the sons of the crown , if a great public office is confided to them , 724 are de facto , as well as de jure , responsible to this house , if any misconduct in them should be proved before it . When a favourite son of our much loved , much respected monarch , a son , who , having been Captain General , and Commander in Chief during 14 years , had the means of attaching so many military and near connexions of the military in this house ; a son , to whom much credit is due , for having introduced institutions and regulations well calculated to improve and maintain the efficiency of our army , has thus been made responsible , no doubt can remain in present or future times on that subject . If it was possible that any future sons of future monarchs of this country , surrounded as they probably will be , with flattery from the moment of their birth , should lose sight of this sacred principle of our constitution , this fact must recall to their ' minds that this house will not acquiesce in their holding offices of great trust , if consequences injurious to the public have been proved to have proceeded from misconduct in them . But the amende honorable having being made by this resignation , I am now disposed to concur in the proposition that no further proceedings are necessary . As I know how disorderly it would be to introduce the king , as having any influence on an opinion to be given in this house , I shall abstain from such irregularity , but I will say that if the son of a venerable private gentleman , who by the observance of all moral and religious duties had acquired the respect and affection of his neighbours , could be brought before this house on a case similar to that now before it , I should say , My paramount duty is , to take care that the case should be so marked as to deter others from similar misconduct ; this object being attained , my mind would then feet for such a father , and I would say , I will not give him an additional pang . If these feelings would not be reprehensible in such a case , I conceive that , as the advantages to the public from exemplary manners , are in proportion to the elevation in rank , I can not be less disposed on the present occasion Co concur with the amended motion , that the Duke of York having resigned , no further proceeding is necessary . thought , that although this motion was not so necessary after the resignation as before it , yet still it was proper for the house to express its sentiments upon those other points , which their 725 former votes bad not included . He had to complain of some misrepresentations of what he had formerly said upon the subject of this investigation ; for he was convinced there was no part of the conduct of his royal highness that could deserve that degree of reprehension which he was stated to have expressed . This much be should say , however , upon the immorality disclosed in this business , that although it did not fall to the house to take cognizance of private immorality , yet when it had a public effect upon official duties , it unquestionably should come before them , and it was their duty to express their sentiments regarding it . Under such circumstances as
