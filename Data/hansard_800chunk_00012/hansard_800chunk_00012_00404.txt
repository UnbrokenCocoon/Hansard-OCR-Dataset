Duke of York of any real knowledge of those transactions , of any direct corruption or participation in it ; but still he could not , under the impression of the evidence , say , that he could conceive that his royal highness could be utterly without suspicion on the subject . After the scenes which had been disclosed at the bar , and exposed to the country and to all Europe , it was absolutely necessary that the house should express its sense of these abuses ; and the motion of his honourable friend he considered as wise , prudent , moderate , and just . He thought , moreover , that it was necessary to make some reparation to public morals and decency , and that the public safety required that the house should communicate to his majesty , that in their opinion , the command of the army could be no longer with prudence or safety confided to the Duke of York.â€”It was customary in that house to call things by very soft and gentle names . That which used to be called 'adultery , ' was now only 'living under protection . ' It was in this way that when religion and social order were attacked in France , we heard of ' a mother without being a wife . ' The applying those delicate expressions to acts of immorality , was striking at the root of the morals of this country . The house had been now sitting , day after day , in the consideration of those transactions , and in tearing of the veil which covered them . If , when they were now laid bare , the house was to abstain from passing an opinion upon them , they would do an irreparable injury to the morality of this country . It would be found throughout the page of history , that religion and morals were the best preservers of States , and that when they were upon the decline in any country , it was a sure prognostic of that country 's approaching fall . He would not say that the charges were of that nature that it was absolutely necessary to bring forward ; but when the house had been compelled to take notice of them , he did not see how they could avoid coming to that conclusion which was impressed on their minds by the evidence which had been stated . He should read an extract from an author who was not considered either as a religious or moral authority , but who was eminently distinguished for political knowledge and sagacity . Machiavel had stated , that `` the rulers of all states , whether kingdoms or common-wealths , should take care that religion should be honoured , and all its ceremonies preserved inviolate , for 591 there was not a more certain symptom of the destruction of states , than a contempt for religion and morals . '' As to the slight censure conveyed in the Resolution of his right hon . friend ( the Chancellor of the Exchequer ) , he really thought it would have been better not to have touched upon the subject at all , than to touch upon it so lightly . It seemed as if the laws of courtesy were more to be attended to than the laws of God . As to the confidence that was expressed in his royal highness following for the future the illustrious example set him by his royal father , that was an extraordinary degree of confidence , for which he would be glad to know the grounds . The noble lord behind him , in adverting to the influence of mistresses , had naturally turned to the time of Charles the second . This called to his recollection the circumstance , that when Charles H. conducted himself improperly in Scotland with respect to a loose female , a deputation from the Kirk was sent to remonstrate with him . Their spokesman , Douglas , having left the rest of the deputation at a considerable distance , went up to his majesty , who expected
