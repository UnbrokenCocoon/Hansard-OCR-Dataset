the house might then adjourn ; by which means it would be made manifest on the Journals that the house had not come to a conclusion on the general subject . The Chancellor of the Exchequer , who had already moved the Order of the Day , refused to withdraw his motion , and observed that as he should propose a call of the house on Monday , it would sufficiently appear that the deliberations on the subject had not come to a conclusion . intimated , that a certain event might possibly take place before the house should meet again ; and that 712 in that case it would be for ever disgraced as it might express no further opinion on the subject * After some further discussion , it was understood that Mr. Bathurst 's motion was to have the precedence on Monday . rose , and said that before the house proceeded to renew the debate the house proceeded to renew the debate he would beg leave to take that opportunity of making to them a communication which his right hon . friend ( Mr. Bathurst ) might think with him was of a nature that rendered further proceeding unnecessary . He had , then to state , that on last Saturday morning , after the decision of the house had been known , his royal highness the Duke of York , of his own immediate and spontaneous motion , waited upon his majesty , and tendered to him his Resignation of the Chief Command of his majesty 's Army ; and that his majesty had been graciously pleased to accept of that resignation ; the motives which evidently influenced the mind of his royal highness in taking that step appeared to him , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , to be of a nature so honourable and proper that he was sure , when he had stated them to the house , the house would think of them as he did .
