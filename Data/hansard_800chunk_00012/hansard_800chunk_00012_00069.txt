and after shortly recapitulating the points of the Case which he had observed upon the day before , and making some additional observations on , col. French 's Levy , he proceeded as follows : The Case , sir , of col. Shaw , which I am now proceeding to examine , will be found extremely to deserve the attention of the 115 house ; and I wish particularly to direct that attention to the evidence of Mrs. C , upon this charge ; because it will appear that it is most completely falsified . It is not merely that there is reason to doubt of her truth , but there is distinct and full evidence of her falsehood . She states , that col. Shaw promised her a remuneration of 1,000l . in the event of his obtaining a situation upon the staff ; that he wished to be colonel of the Manx Corps in the Isle of Man , where his father had been deputy governor . She is then asked , `` Do you mean to say that you applied for this situation for him ? '' She says , `` Yes , I did ; but there were stronger claims in another quarter . '' Her examination thus continues : `` Did you then apply for any other situation for him ? '' `` Yes , I did . '' `` What was that ? '' `` That which he now holds . '' `` Do you know what that is ? '' `` Barrack-Master at the Cape of Good Hope ; Barrack-Master-General , I believe . '' `` Did you receive any pecuniary consideration in consequence of this appointment ? '' `` Yes , I did . '' `` What did you receive ? '' `` 500l . '' `` Do you recollect how you received that money ? '' `` I had 300l . from col. Shaw , and 200l . brought by some man , I understood it was a clerk of Coutts 's , but I am not positive , and on that account had a great mind to send it back again , thinking it would be made public ? '' `` Were you satisfied with this 500l. ? '' `` No , I was not . '' `` In consequence of your not being satisfied with the 500l . did you make any complaint through the Commander iii Chief ? '' `` Yes , I did . '' `` What was the consequence of such complaint ? '' `` H. r. h. said , he had told me all along , that I had a very bad sort of a man to deal with , and that I ought to have been more careful , and that he would immediately put him upon half-pay . '' `` Do you know whether major Shaw was put upon half-pay , in consequence of that ? '' `` He sent me several letters , complaining , but I did not trouble myself much with reading them : one of the letters I gave in to-night , I believe . I thought him already too well off , for his conduct to me . `` â€”This is her evidence with respect to col. Shaw : so that the house may observe , that she confirms the statement of the hon . gent. , in his opening , namely , that in consequence of her having been disappointed in receiving the money she expected from col. Shaw , and which he had promised her , she complained to the Commander in Chief , who thereupon reduced him to half-pay . As 116 to the further application of col. Shaw , she says , she paid no attention to it , because she considered that person to have been already too well used . Now , sir , if the house will indulge me with their attention , I will undertake to prove that this letter of col. Shaw , the very document which she brings forward , and refers to as part of her story , is utterly inconsistent with the story she relates .
