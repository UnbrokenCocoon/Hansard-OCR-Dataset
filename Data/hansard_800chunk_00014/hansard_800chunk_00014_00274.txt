requires some previous study and qualifications ; and all writers on political economy agree in considering the time thus bestowed , and the expence thus incurred , by every individual , as a part of the useful productive capital of the state , as well as the just property of the party , in the enjoyment of the fruits of which he is entitled to legislative protection . I am aware that the occupations of an insurance broker and underwriter are generally considered as requiring but very superficial attainments ; but a candid investigation of the subject will prove this idea to be erroneous . An insurance broker can only qualify himself for his business by considerable study and application : he must learn how to fill up policies of every description , with all the various clauses adapted to every possible circumstance ; he must be able to make accurate declarations of interest , so as to cover the parties in case of loss , and yet not expose them to the payment of any unnecessary premium in case of arrival ; he must know how to make up complex 415 statements of average and partial losses on every species of merchandize , and on the various principles applicable to every different case . He must be informed of the current rates of premiums on every voyage , in order that he may be enabled to transact the business entrusted to him to the best advantage ; and he must be well acquainted with the character of the different underwriters , to guide him in the selection of the names he takes upon his policies . The underwriter must possess every species of knowledge requisite for the broker , ( except indeed as to the solidity of his brother underwriters ; ) it being his province to examine all his papers and statements ; in addition to which , he must be well versed in geography ; must be informed of the safety or danger of every port and road in every part of the world ; of the nature of the navigation to and from every country ; and of the proper season for undertaking different voyages ; he should be acquainted , not only with the state , but the stations of the naval force of his own country , and of the enemy ; he should watch the appearances of any change in the relations of all foreign powers , by which his interests may be affected ; and in short , constantly devote much time and attention to the pursuit in which he is engaged . Those who commence underwriters without the necessary qualification , or continue underwriters without the necessary caution , generally soon find their error , in their own ruin , and the injury of those with whom they are connected . The gentlemen who have subscribed to this new company , wish to become brokers and underwriters , without loss of time or hindrance of business ; to put themselves in possession of their emoluments , without that study and labour , or those qualifications , by which alone they can be fairly acquired . Archimedes told Hiero , who wished to be a great mathematician all at once , that there was no royal road to geometry ; and this observation may be justly applied to the acquirement of any other species of knowledge , or to the fruits of that knowledge . But the subscribers to this new company are endeavouring to find out a royal road to the profits of the insurance brokers and underwriters ; and this royal road is an act of parliament , enabling the king to grant them a charter of incorporation.â€”The effect of establishing a company possessing such vast influence within itself , must be that this great leviathan will swallow up 416 all the small fry ; that it will deprive the insurance brokers and underwriters of those avocations to which they hare devoted their time , in which they have embarked their fortunes , and by which they have maintained themselves and their families . But it is contended , that
