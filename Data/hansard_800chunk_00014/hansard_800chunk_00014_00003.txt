now imperiously called upon to do our duty , and to institute those inquiries which the misconduct of ministers have rendered absolutely necessaryâ€”a misconduct , from which a series of unexampled disasters and calamities have resulted to the country . My lords , my heart is full , and I must give vent to my feelings . The day must come when ministers will have to render an account to parliament of the treasure which they have wasted , and the lives which they have sacrificed in useless and unprofitable expeditions . We owe it to the country , that the king 's ministers should be called upon to render that account , and we shall fail in the discharge of our duty to the country , if we do not insist upon it . The day will come , when the mere fact of an 10 overflowing treasury , alluded to in the speech of the king 's commissioners , will be utterly insufficient to satisfy this House , or the people of these realms ; when we must inquire , not merely as to the fact , but as to the foundation of it , and the consequences which result from it . The day will come when the conduct of ministers , respecting America , must come under discussion , and be brought to the test of inquiry ; when it must become a subject for deep and serious investigation , whether in a country that yet boasts of freedom ; whether in a house of parliament that yet keeps up the forms of discussion ; whether it is to be endured that garbled , mutilated , and misrepresented documents are to be laid before parliament , not merely concealing what it was not thought fit to communicate , but actually , upon the face of those garbled and mutilated documents , giving an interpretation directly opposite to the sense of them in their entire and original state . In the same manner , with respect to our expeditions , it is due to the memory of those who have fallen in the service of their country ; it is due to the memory of those who have bravely but ingloriously fallen a sacrifice to the ignorance , the incapacity , and the misconduct of ministers ; it is due to a deluded and a suffering people , who demand it at our hands , that we should institute a rigorous and an effectual inquiry into the conduct of those ministers to whom these disasters are to be attributed . Yet in spite of the disgraceful and calamitous expedition to Walcheren , where the treasure of the country was so lavishly wasted , and the lives of its gallant defenders so uselessly sacrifised , did his Majesty 's ministers advise his Majesty to tell the city of London that he did not think it necessary to institute an inquiry ; however , we find in the Speech of the king 's commissioners , that ministers , from a sense of their guilty situation , from a consciousness of their own glaring misconduct , and from a fear of the consequences of that misconduct , have condescended to tell us , that they will lay before parliament , certain documents and papers relative to this subject . But let us not be deluded by this shew of a readiness for inquiry ; the Speech merely says , such papers and documents as shall be deemed satisfactory by ministers themselves . It becomes us , my lords , to adopt a course of proceeding adequate to the exigency of the case and the difficulty of the times . The Address 11 moved by the noble earl does not contain any pledge to the country of an intention on the part of your lordships , to institute inquiry ; it does not even declare , the necessity of having all the papers and documents laid before us , relative to this disastrous expedition ; but merely consists of a complimentary expression of thanks , that certain papers are intended to be produced . My lords , we shall not this
