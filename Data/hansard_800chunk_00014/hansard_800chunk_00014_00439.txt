Whitbread 's Amendment was then put from the Chair , and negatived without a division ; and the original question for taking the report of the Committee of Supply 'now ' into consideration was carried in the affirmative . The House then agreed to all the resolutions of its Committee , excepting that relating to the Home Staff , the further consideration of which was postponed until this day fortnight . â€”I have in my hand notes of the precise conversation which passed between lord Mulgrave and myself on the 4th of June , which I am ready to give in , if it is the pleasure of the Committee that they should be inserted in the minutes , instead of the statement I made from memory ; the statements are the same in substance ; there are no material variations .
