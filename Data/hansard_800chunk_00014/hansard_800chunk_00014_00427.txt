for the complaints of the Irish distiller on the fluctuation of the revenue laws , and would endeavour to obviate similar complaints , in the system he now proposed to have adopted , by granting licences for three years , which would give stability to speculation , instead of for one year , as had hitherto been the practice . There was another point which was deserving of all consideration , and which he had been induced to adopt , after the most minute investigation . It was at once , to reduce the duties from their present rate , 5s . 8d . per gallon , to 2s . 6d . He was satisfied that the revenue would not suffer by this ; for though in the first year there might be a risk of diminution , yet , when the illicit trade was destroyed , which he was convinced would be the tendency of this measure , the sum paid to government by the legal distiller , would much more than counterbalance the lower rate of duty . Another of his objects would be to simplify the law . Those who now entered into the distillation trade could not be expected to be men of much education . The less complicated the revenue laws were , it would be the more advantageous ; he would , therefore , abolish entirely the existing distinctions and drawbacks on the quantity of malt or spirits , and simply to charge 2s . 6d . per gallon on the quantity distilled . To avoid the increased expence of collecting the revenue , he proposed to have the collectors of hearth rates and assessed taxes employed also in collecting this branch of the revenue , without the intervention of the excise . His object was to pass a law beneficial to Ireland , and he would gladly listen to suggestions from every side of the House , without thinking of party , or difference of feelings on other points . He therefore invited gentlemen to communicate to him every idea that would tend to render the measure generally useful . Revenue , though from his situation it might be thought so , was not his sole object . By the proposed system , the morals of the people also , which were so injured by those illicit stills , would be improved , and the laws , now contemned , would , by being enforced , become more respected . A dangerous class of persons would be put down . He alluded to those , who without the cognizance of , and unknown to the magistrate , kept houses for the sale of spirits , illegally distilled , under whose roofs had originated many of the evils 655 which had lately so much distressed Ireland . With these objects in view , he moved , `` That the chairman be instructed to ask leave to bring in a hill to alter and amend the laws in force respecting the distillation in Ireland . '' expressed his satisfaction at the measure proposed by the right hon . gent . and his readiness to co-operate with him as far as lay in his power , in carrying it into execution . He accorded most cordially with the proposition , which went to do what he had for the last four years pressed upon the consideration of the House.â€”He had ever wished to impress upon them the necessity of dispersing small stills over the country ; and he had twice taken the sense of the House upon the question of withdrawing the bounties from the large stills . On one or two points of minor importance , however , he differed from the right hon . gent . He could not impute the increase of the illicit trade so much to the prohibition of distillation from grain , as it was known to exist to a very great extent before passing of that measure . Neither could he accord with the principle of survey , as necessary or beneficial to the revenue . It gave rise to frauds on the part of the trader , and
