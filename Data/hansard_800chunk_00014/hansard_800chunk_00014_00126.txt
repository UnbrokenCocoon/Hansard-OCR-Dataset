, that he was almost tempted to leave the room , ( a buz of murmur , and Order ! order ! ) However , as there were so many of them in the House , if they would but shorten their speeches , ii would afford an opportunity to hear the sentiments of many able gentlemen , who would be prevented by long winded harangues from addressing the House at all . With respect to the question before the House , he must remark , that if ministers were really disposed to inquiry they would have produced the papers to the House on that very day . They would , in that case , not have given an opportunity to any gentlemen to move for a Committee of inquiry ; an inquiry , which in his view was absolutely necessary . The whole country , from one end to the other , was loudly calling for it ; and the country , he must say , had a right to be informed where the fault lay whether the Expedition had been badly planned , or badly executed . The inquiry , therefore , was indispensably necessary ; and the sooner that House should decide upon it , the sooner they would prove themselves to be the real representatives of the people who sent them there.â€”As to what had been said respecting the language of the King 's Speech , and the Address , that was of little signification , because they all knew , that these were always drawn up in a complimentary form , ( a laugh ) . But it would have a bad effect , that it should go to the enemy , that on such a subject any difference of opinion existed ; or that when the necessity for it was universally felt and known , no inquiry was to take place . An hon . member opposite ( sir J. Sebright ) , had on a former night talked of his not having confidence in the existing government ; but he would ask that hon . member , what confidence he could repose in him , who had done him all the disservice in his power , in order to turn him out of that House ( loud laughter . ) Another hon . gent . had used language towards his majesty 's ministers , which was even still more severe . That right hon . gent . ( Mr. Tierney ) , forsooth , did not mean to affront them , whilst he was , at the same time , applying to them the most pointed invectives . But he did not think it necessary to say more on the occasion , than that he should vote for the question for the inquiry . This was no time for shuffling ; and if they wished to set aside the distrust which had been industriously ex- 186 cited against that House , nothing could remove it more effectually than to agree to the inquiry . If they should not he would tell them that something worse might come . The prosperity of this country , which contained more wealth , comforts and happiness , than any other in the world , was an object worth securing by inquiry . He was not for any new-fangled doctrines for altering or reforming the state of the representation in that House ; but he thought that parliament should go further than the present inquiry , and appoint a Committee to examine into sinecure offices . They ought to take care that no man should hold a sinecure place without doing the duties of the office . They should ascertain what every man did for the money he received It was more particularly necessary now , when the tax-gatherers were at every man 's door threatening to proceed to extremities , unless they were paid ; and when the orders for such rigour were given by persons holding sinecure offices of 10 or20,000l . a year . He should , therefore , support the motion . The Chancellor of the Exchequer declared , in rising to state a
