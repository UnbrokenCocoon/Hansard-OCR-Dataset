House uncontradicted ; and that by the Statute commonly called the septennial act the same House of Commons may sit for a period equal to one half of the probable duration of human life , taken at the most favourable age ; and that the right of the Commons to send representatives to parliament was , by our ancient constitution , vested in the freeholders and householders , and long parliaments were heretofore as unknown as the modern practice of members procuring their seats in the House by purchase , nomination , or by barter of patronage ; and that every departure from this undoubted right of the people to a substantial representation in short parliaments was a violation of the fundamental principles of the constitution , and is a grievance dangerous alike to the liberties and property of the people : and that this deplorable state of the representation co-operating with the septennial duration of parliaments , has an alarming tendency to destroy that constitutional balance which ought to subsist between the three branches of the legislature , and threatens the free subjects of these realms with a tyranny more hateful and degrading than a despotic monarchy—the usurpation of our rights by an oligarchy of the proprietors of boroughs ; and that the elective franchise ought to be entrusted to those , 355 and to those only , who are likely to exercise it for the common good , which , by the act passed in the last session of parliament , to regulate the disposal of seats in the House , the petitioners conclude not to be the case in the venal or depopulated boroughs : in the wisdom and justice of the House the petitioners confidently rely , that the House will take their Petition into their early and most serious consideration , and will grant them such relief in the premises as shall be most consistent with that leading principle of our happy constitution , a full and free representation of the people in parliament . `` —Ordered to lie upon the table . brought down a Message from the King , which the Speaker read from the chair as follows : — `` George R.—His Majesty being desirous of conferring a signal mark of his favour and approbation on lieutenant-general Arthur lord viscount Wellington , knight of the most honourable order of the Bath , in consequence of the eminent services rendered by him in the brilliant and decisive victory obtained by the troops under his command , against a superior French force at Talavera on the 28th day of July , 1809 , and of the valour and skill displayed by him on that occasion , recommends it to his faithful Commons to enable his Majesty to make provision for securing to the said lieutenant-general Arthur lord viscount Wellington , and the two next succeeding heirs on whom the titles of viscount Wellington of Talavera , and of Wellington in the county of Somerset , and of baron Douro , of Wellesley , in the said county , shall descend , a net annuity of 2,000l. , in such manner as shall be thought most effectual for the benefit of the said lord viscount Wellington , and his family . addressed lord Gambier to the following purport , — '' Baron Gambier , I am requested to inform you that this House has passed an unanimous Vote of Thanks for the skill , zeal , ability and anxious attention which you so eminently displayed against the enemy in Basque roads , whereby you were enabled , 356 under the greatest disadvantages , to destroy the enemy 's ships , enjoying a peculiar situation amidst their shoals , and under the imagined security of their shores . The eminent services , baron Gambier , which you displayed on former occasions in the cause of your King and your country , have not escaped the recollection of this House . It is remembered , when his Majesty thought you worthy of the high honours which he conferred , this House also considered you entitled to the greatest reward it could bestow , namely , their thanks
