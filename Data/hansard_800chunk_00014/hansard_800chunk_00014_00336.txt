to adopt the address which he should now have the honour of proposing . The noble Marquis concluded with moving an address to the effect we have already mentioned . felt it an ungrateful task , a painful duty , to recal their lordships attention to predictions formerly made to them , but then despised and rejected ; though now , unfortunately , all of them , too fatally , fulfilled . He knew how little acceptable it was to anticipate , by a referrence to our past experience a continuance of the same disasters ; but in discharging that duty , he did it with the more consolation , because it was not a mere barren censure of past errors , that was his object , but rather from the consideration of those errors , to conjure them to rescue the country from similar calamities , to pay some regard to the valuable lives of their fellow-citizens , and to ask their lordships whether they were disposed to sit in that House day after day , and year after year , spectators of wasteful expenditure , and the useless effusion of so much of the best blood of the country in hopeless , calamitous , and disgraceful efforts . Such being his object in rising to address their lordships , he might plead to them the cause of the British army , which might soon be wanted for our own safety , and should , therefore , not be exposed in wild , impracticable , and useless expeditions . What return did their lordships think was due to that army for the eminent skill , and discipline , and valour which it bad displayed ? it was a sacred duty imposed upon their lordships , to see that not one more life was wasted , not one more drop of blood shed unprofitably , where no thinking man could say , that by any human possibility , such dreadful sacrifices could be made with any prospect of advantage to the country . Could it be agreeable to their lordships to be fed from day to day with views of unprofitable successes—of imaginary advantages to be gained by our army , for ourselves or for our allies ? —Let their lordships ask themselves the question—was there any man that heard him , who , in his conscience , believed , that even the sacrifice of the whole of that brave British army would secure the kingdom of Portugal ; and if he received , from any person , an answer in affirmation of that opinion , he should be able to judge by that answer , of the capacity of such a person for the government of this country , or even for the transaction of public business in a delibe- 512 rative assembly . By whatever circumstances , by whatever kind of fate it was , he must say , in point of fact , that , in his opinion , he always thought the object of the enterprize impossible : but now he believed it was known to all the people of this country , that it had become , certainly , impossible . Could any man who looked at our immense exertions for the last seventeen years—at those efforts we were making at the present time , and had still to make , in defence of our best and dearest interests—were this even a mere question of a million of money which the country was now about to expend through this measure , a feature in the business which his noble friend in his statements had very prudently suppressed ; could any man say , that the expenditure of such a sum , amounting at least to a tenth of the income-tax , collected under such circumstances of privation , was not a subject of serious consideration and concern to the country ? —A sum proposed to be expended , not to save the government of a prince who had abandoned his states , but to support the very vices which had been described as the cause of all the mischiefs of that government which , for
