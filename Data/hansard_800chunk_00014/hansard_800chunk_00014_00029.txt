the Convention of Cintra . So that , on the whole the result is this ; that during the time they have conducted his government , his Majesty 's ministers have attempted every thing , every where , on the largest pos- 38 * sible scale , and that in every thing they have failed ; except indeed in that instance in which they directed his arms not against his enemies but against his allies . Entrusted with the largest means and with the most unbounded confidence , thanks to the liberality and to the folly of the people of England , they have proceeded to engage in the mightiest enterprises , and these enterprizes have all had either a ludicrous , or a disastrous termination . Now , Sir , I say that to maintain , that accident has been every thing , and misconduct nothing , in these transactions , is to maintain , that a species of miracle has been worked against us.â€”Accident may account for some detached failures in the course of a long administration ; but a man must have a high opinion indeed of the King 's servants , and must moreover have an understanding most singularly constituted , who can persuade himself that the Convention of Cintra , the miserable expulsion of our army under sir John Moore , the ludicrous capture of Ischia and Procida , the second useless , expensive and destructive campaign in Spain , and to crown all , the expedition to Walcheren ; that all these things following each other with the utmost rapidity , not a single success intervening to break the chain of calamity , happened by pure ill luck , and without the smallest of blame to the wisest and best , but most unfortunate of administrations . And then , Sir , in whose favour is it that we are required to believe this paradox ? Is it in favour of a firm united government , guided by some person of acknowledged abilities , and directing an undivided attention towards objects of great public concern ? No , Sir , we are required to believe in favour of a government of departments , at the head of which till lately , stood a nobleman of no very distinguished talents , enfeebled by age and suffering , and labouring ineffectually during the latter days of his life , to keep together the discordant parts of a precarious administration ; we are required to believe it in favour of a cabinet , the members of which , entertained for each other the most profound contempt , or the most deadly antipathy ; we are required to believe that an unremitting attention was paid to the interests of the state by ministers , whose time , ( as we have since learnt by documents which are in every man 's hands , and ought to be imprinted on every man 's recollection , ) was spent 39 * in dark machiavelian intrigues , in personal discussions , and in devising schemes for parcelling out the great offices of state , which they seem to have considered as a private inheritance to be divided for their common benefit , not as a solemn trust to be administered for the public good . We are required to believe in the fitness of those who had pronounced upon each other 's incapacity ; and it is from discord at home and disgrace abroad , that we are to infer wisdom and good conduct . For my own part , Sir , I am content to direct ray view of the case by those plain concurring rules , that guide men in their judgments upon the ordinary affairs of life , who wherever they see disunion , are apt to suspect weakness ; who where they observe constant failures and mistakes , always presume ignorance , incapacity or neglect . Therefore , when I call to mind the ignominious history of their internal dissensions , when I see that their whole administration has been one uniform tissue of calamities , a foul and detestable blot in the annals of the country
