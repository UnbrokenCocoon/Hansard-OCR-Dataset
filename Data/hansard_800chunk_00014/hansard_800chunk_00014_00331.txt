had of late prevailed , he thought it high time some measures should be adopted effectually to check such proceedings ; and , that the House should mark its sense of its own dignity on the present occasion , by inflicting some exemplary punishment on the person at the bar . He therefore moved , That John Gale Jones , for his 502 offence , be committed to his Majesty 's gaol of Newgate . then adverted to the case of John Dean , the printer , who attended at the bar yesterday , and was now in the custody of the Serjeant at arms , and said , that from the manner in which Dean had conducted himself , the readiness with which he gave up the name of the author of the libel in question , the contrition he had shewn for his offence , and the consideration that he was an honest and industrious man , with a family , and not in affluent circumstances , he should now move that he be discharged without paying fees . said , he understood the prisoner was prepared to comply with the usual forms of the House , by presenting a petition praying for his release . presented two petitions from the Roman Catholics of England , the first stating the hardships arising from the disabilities under which they laboured , and respectfully praying to be relieved from them ; and the second expressing their willingness to consent to any arrangement that might be deemed necessary for the security of the existing establishments which might not be inconsistent with their own religious opinions.—The petitions having been read , his lordship said he should merely now move that they be laid on the table , and should not probably make any motion relative to them during the session . He could not , however , omit the opportunity of making a few observations upon the subject to which these petitions related , and which , in whatever point of view considered , was one of the greatest importance .

They were indeed placed in a worse situation than the Catholics in other parts of his Majesty 's dominions . In Canada his Majesty 's Catholic subjects were allowed all the benefits of the most enlarged toleration , or , in other words , were eligible to all offices in common with their protestant fellow subjects . In Ireland Catholics were allowed to act as Magistrates under commissions of the peace—to become members of lay corporations , except Trinity College , at which , however , they might take degrees , and to vote at elections for members of parliament ; all the ranks of the army were also open to them , except that of a general on the staff . In England Catholics could not act as magistrates , could not be included in a commission of the peace—could not become members of any Corporation , and were debarred from taking degrees at either of the Universities ; the ranks of the army and navy were closed against them , and even if giving up the rank to which they were born and becoming privates in any military force , they were dependent upon the will of others , not merely as to whether they should he allowed to exercise their own religion , but whether they should not
