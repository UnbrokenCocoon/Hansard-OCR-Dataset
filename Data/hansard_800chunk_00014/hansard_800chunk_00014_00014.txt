gratifying his animosity against this country , and it was well known with what indefatigable zeal and unceasing activity he followed up every favourite design formed by his revenge , or dictated by his ambition . He had often loudly boasted of having brought his designs and his means at Antwerp to full maturity and perfection ; and , indeed , when he had a main object to gain , he left nothing untried , and no practicable effort unexerted to accomplish it . Was not this , therefore , a proper object to engage the attention of a British government , and could any doubt be entertained of the policy , nay of the necessity of frustrating or endeavouring to frustrate so formidable a design . Accordingly , it was resolved to make a well directed effort to destroy the arsenal and navy , and to deprive our bitterest enemy of the mightiest means by which he was enabled to annoy us . The design , through various unexpected and unforeseen , because unascertainable difficulties , had not been wholly accomplished ; though so far accomplished as to render abortive his schemes of hostility from that quarter ; that end , the complete demolition of the harbour and arsenal of Flushing had secured . Whatever disastrous effects had arisen from the operations necessary to its attainment were indeed to be lamented ; but they were not in the first instance to have been apprehended . The design promised to be executed in a short time , and before the season set in , whose pestilential influence was particularly to be dreaded and most essential to be guarded against . The Expedition was ready to sail about the middle of July ; but was detained nine or ten days by contrary winds , and the other unforeseen and uncontroulable obstacles occurred afterwards to protract the operations till the unhealthy period of the year ; but all these obstructions could not possibly have been foreseen or guarded against . This the information would shew which his Majesty had ordered to be laid before their lordships , and until that information was in the possession of their lordships , it would be impossible for them to decide upon the subject , or to institute a fair inquiry . These 27 reasons , he conceived , would be of themselves sufficient to induce the justice of the House not to accede to the Amendment proposed by his noble friend.â€”The other point so much insisted upon and reprobated by his noble friend , was the Expedition to Spain and Portugal . Here again his noble friend 's strictures and censures were almost in every respect without foundation ; great and important objects had been achieved by that Expedition ; it had rescued Portugal from the French ; it had covered the British arms and the character of the British army with glory , and by the position that army afterwards occupied and maintained , it rendered infinite service to the Spanish armies . It covered them in several points ; it secured the defence of Estremadura , and in a great measure that of La Mancha . To this Expedition was also owing the deliverance of Gallicia , and the securing of the ships at Ferrol . Were not these important objects , and did not the attainment of them afford very just grounds of triumph and congratulation ? Would it , therefore , be fair to condemn in the gross the conduct of his Majesty 's ministers ; to precipitate an inquiry into the measures they had pursued , or rather , to pronounce judgment and condemnation on them without instituting any inquiry at all ? Such , he thought , would be the effect of adopting the Amendment moved by his noble friend , and he therefore felt himself imperiously called upon to resist it as a proceeding unprecedented and unjust . said , if he thought any power of speech or language necessary to excite the indignation of their lordships or of the country , at the scenes which the government had lately exhibited to the world , he would not
