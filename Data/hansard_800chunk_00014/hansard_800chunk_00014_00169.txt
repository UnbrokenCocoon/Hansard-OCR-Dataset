thenceforward be granted . When that Resolution , and the bill grounded upon it , were brought before the House , his right hon . friend , though not then minister , but yet a member of the House , said not one word of opposition against the bill . It was read a second time , and was proceeding to a Committee , when the dissolution of that parliament stopped its progress . On the meeting of the next parliament , his Majesty , in his speech from the throne , expressed his peculiar approbation of that Committee . On the meeting of the second session , his Majesty , in his speech , again repeated the same approbation of that Committee . The bill founded on the Resolution of the House was again brought forward and passed , but was , unexpectedly , towards the close of the first session , thrown out in the Lords ; when the House , taking into consideration the lateness of the period , and the quarrels that were going on in the House , and finding there would not be time to pass another bill , thought proper to address his Majesty not to suffer any place in reversion to be granted during the recess.â€”The propriety of the principle that places ought not to be granted in reversion , was universally acknowledged . The bill , however , again failed . A consultation took place , and the Lords ' Journals were inspected , to see if the Committee appointed for that purpose could find any particular reason why the bill had been rejected , but all in vain . Under all the circumstances of the session before last , when he found it was impossible to do more than he had done , he was himself the author of a temporary suspension bill , as he thought it afforded an opportunity to shew the temper and moderation of the House , and in order to avoid any thing that might lead to a misunderstanding between the two Houses . In doing this , he 253 did all he could to render the measure as palatable and as gracious as possible , but in no one panicle of his conduct had he ever shewn the smallest tittle of inclination to give up his perpetual bill , and by inserting words suggested by his right hen . friend , as likely to ease the feelings of some particular individuals , he had acceded solely as thinking them of no very particular consequence . He should , therefore , think it peculiarly hard , if those words inserted in the preamble of the act just before read , should be urged against this bill ; because he expressly stated , at the time , his reasons to be what he had just said , and that he had never lost sight of a perpetual one . It now became the House to shew they were determined to carry into execution that which they had already so unanimously resolved . That bill which had been rejected , could not be brought forward again ; and , therefore , the best way was to resort to their former one . Suppose it should fail again , they might then do as they had done before . He thought after the House , and the whole country also , had shewn so great and unremitting an eagerness and anxiety to pass the bill , it would not be right to assume such a thing as that prejudices against it could still remain in the breasts of any persons elsewhere , after so much had been done to allay them first , and afterwards to eradicate them . It was needless , he thought , for him to call their attention to the necessity there was that the House should endeavour , by every means in their power , to preserve the good opinion of their constituents . The eyes of all classes in the country were fixed on them , and it was their incumbent duty to shew , at this important Crisis , that the
