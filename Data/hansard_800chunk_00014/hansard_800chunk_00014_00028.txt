all those things that ought to form the main topics of an Address of the House of Commons , under circumstances of great public distress , and acknowledged weakness in the national councils , it will be a vain and hopeless task for me , or any man even to address you upon any similar occasion hereafter . If we do not act now we must be considered as having determined not to act at all ; as having resigned ourselves implicitly to the guidance of any persons that may happen to be placed at the helm , and as having completely renounced that salutary controul , which we were once accustomed to exercise over the servants of the Crown . The main point , Sir , to which the attention of the House will naturally be directed , is , the conduct of the war . Every person that now hears me must remember with grief that during the few months that have elapsed since the last session of Parliament , this country has been engaged in various military operation upon a most extensive scale , and that these operations have been attended by failure more complete , by loss more deplorable , and by disgrace more signal , than any that we find recorded , within an equal space of time , in the history of this or any former war , in which the country was ever engaged . This is the plain statement of the fact , which gentlemen may endeavour to extenuate , but which they can not substantially contradict ; and it is therefore for us to consider , how far 37 * these things affect the character and pretensions of those persons who then were , and who for the greater part still are , entrusted with the management of affairs . And if upon a review of these transactions , it should appear to us , that we have reason to impute our misfortunes to the misconduct of our rulers , it will become us , not only to institute an immediate , vigilant and severe enquiry , but at once to carry our suspicions to the foot of the throne , and humbly to represent to his Majesty , that we no longer feel ourselves able to rely on those persons , whom he has chosen to be his advisers . But before we proceed , as we must proceed hereafter , to look at these questions in detail , I must in the first place remark , that the very magnitude and number of those failures which have disgraced their administration , do alone form a strong prima facie case against his Majesty 's ministers , even independently of all consideration of the particular circumstances by which they were attended . For though it is unjust and absurd to say , that failure necessarily implies blame , and though enterprises the most wisely planned , and the most skilfully executed may fail , from causes which human wisdom can neither foresee nor controul ; yet constant repeated invariable failures do create a fair presumption of misconduct , and if that presumption is coupled with any thing suspicious or unfavourable in the history and composition of the administration itself , it becomes almost irresistible . It would be an insult to the understandings whom I have the honor to address , if I were to spend a moment in endeavouring to elucidate a principle which is so evidently consonant to reason and experience , and a thousand of which , must at once present themselves to the mind of any person who gives himself the trouble to think at all upon the subject . How then , does it apply to the case of his Majesty 's ministers ? Why , Sir , it appears that during the last seven or eight months they have failed in no less than three great and deliberate designs ; that , if we extend our view a little further , we shall conclude the campaign which terminated in the death of sir John Moore , which again was preceded at no long interval by
