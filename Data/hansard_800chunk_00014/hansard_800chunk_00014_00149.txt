of the tremendous batteries of Aix , which , separately or united , '' according to the testimony given , in support of the assertions of lord Gambier , must have demolished every vessel `` locked up in so confined an anchorage . '' Though at the same time , and for the safety , I suppose , of his Majesty 's ships , that might have been sent in , in defiance of `` such unwarrantable peril , '' the vessels aground 223 are removed , by the contriver of the chart , from `` the NW part of the Palles shoal , the NW part nearest the deep water flanking the passage , '' where , he had sworn , they were situated , and which was the fact , to the SE side of the shoal , farthest from the deep water , and beyond the Tonnére , which was not within range ; and `` where they never could have been approached by our ships for the shot to reach them . '' This , Sir , is not all : by Stokes 's deposition , the Cassard , one of the ships that would have raked us with such terrible effect , is stated , and in truth it was so , to have been about one-third of a mile from Aix , and the Foudroyant , another of them , about three cables ' length from her ; but , Mr. Stokes , in his chart , has cunningly put them in a corner , between two shoals , and close to both , where , he has sworn , they could not be got at , though he had positively sworn , first , that they could have annoyed us , and next , that he did not know the distance between the shoals . I have already asserted , Sir , that contradictions of facts , on which the charge was founded , are frequent in the defence of lord Gambier ; but I have yet to tell this House , that these contradictions , in substantive facts , are , in several , nay , many instances , confirmed , sometimes one way , and sometimes in another , by the same individual witnesses , examined in behalf of `` what may be termed '' the defence.—For instance : by some of those witnesses it is said , that the Cassard , Foudroyant , and some of the grounded ships , would have fired with complete effect on the British ships , had they been sent earlier to attack them ; and ; again , that we never could have got near them for the shot to reach.—Assertions that are , in the nature of things , incompatible ; as in positive contradiction to each other , and given in support of lord Gambier 's statements , that three out of the seven ships aground on the Pallés were never within reach of any of the fleet that might have been sent in to attack them ; and , that the other four of the eleven were never in a situation to be assailed , after the fire-ships failed in their main object ; although at another time the noble lord declared , that some of those very ships would have raked our ships had they been sent in earlier than they were . I therefore call on the House to insist on the production of the Minutes of the Trial , and I pledge myself to prove , to the conviction of this House , and to my country , all that I have as- 224 serted . I will also prove partiality on the part of the court , and illegal and unjust conduct on the part of the judge advocate , who admitted , and even courted , evidence on one side , which he rejected on the other ; and urged inquiry into the conduct of officers , whose conduct the court were not empowered to investigate , in order that he might , by insinuations , ( for there could be no other motive , )
