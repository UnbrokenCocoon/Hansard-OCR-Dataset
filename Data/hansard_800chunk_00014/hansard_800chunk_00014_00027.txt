destructive to our arms in 1747 , at which time the proportion of sick to the healthy was as four to one . What the proportion of sick was in the late Expedition remained yet to be ascertained . It was quite impossible that ministers could be ignorant of the fact , which had been thus stated , and he trusted that the country would hold them 35 * answerable for the lives of those brave men that had been thus unprofitably wasted , after all hopes of ulterior success had entirely disappeared . He would only mention another proof of the known un-healthiness of Walcheren , and that was , that the Swiss troops formerly in the pay of the States General , always made it a stipulation that they should not be obliged to serve in Walcheren , at that very season when his Majesty 's ministers determined to keep British soldiers in that country . He mentioned these things to shew , that had ministers possessed the most common information , they must have foreseen the calamities which pestilence and disease would bring upon our troops , if retained at Walcheren at that season of the year.—The noble lord then concluded a speech of very considerable force and strength of argument , by observing that he had confined himself to those two points of the policy of ministers , not from any want of other subjects of crimination , but from a conviction that these would fall into much abler hands . His only reason for occupying so much of the time of the House , and for which he had now to beg their excuse , was , that he might be able to assign his reasons for refusing to concur in the present Address , and in justification of the Amendment he had now to propose . The noble lord then proceeded to read the Amendment , and moved , That all the words of the paragraph relating to the Expedition to Walcheren after the word `` that '' be left out , for the purpose of inserting the following words : `` We have seen with the utmost sorrow and indignation the accumulated failures and disasters of the last campaign , the unavailing waste of our national resources , and the loss of so many thousands of our brave troops , whose distinguished and heroic valour has been unprofitably sacrificed in enter-prizes , productive not of advantage , but of lasting injury to their country ; enter-prizes marked only by a repetition of former errors , tardy and uncombined , incapable in their success of aiding our ally in the critical moment of his fate , but exposing in their failure his majesty 's councils to the scorn and derision of the enemy.—That we therefore feel ourselves bound to institute , without delay , such rigorous and effectual inquiries and proceedings as duty impels us to adopt , in a case where our country has been subjected to unexampled calamity and disgrace . '' said that he was the more anxious to trouble the House with a few words upon the question that was now before them , because it appeared to him that it was not only of great consequence in itself , but that the fate which it should experience , would , in a great measure , enable the country to judge as to the fate of all future questions , relating to the mismanagement of public affairs , and lead to some very important conclusions as to the temper and composition of parliament itself . For , if this House , agreeing in the proposition of the two gentlemen , who spoke first in the debate , should determine , after all the calamities that we have experienced , to present to the throne an Address , which is the mere echo of the words , which the authors of these calamities have thought fit to place in the mouth of their sovereign ; if we express neither resentment at the past , nor anxiety for the future fate of the country committed to such hands ; if we omit
