have the honour to submit to the House , it was my intention to propose the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the conduct of the whole campaign . Upon reflection , however , I am persuaded that it will he much more conducive to the object I have in view , namely , to prove the incapacity and total want of system , that pervade all the military measures of his Majesty 's ministers , to separate the different branches of the campaign , and institute a distinct inquiry into each ; after which particular investigation , the several results may he more clearly summed up , and a general conclusion drawn with greater accuracy , justice and truth . I shall , therefore , in what I have to address to the House and in the motion with which I mean to conclude , confine myself exclusively to the policy and conduct of the late disastrous Expedition to the Scheldt ; and when the House considers that , neither in the Speech from the throne nor in the Address to his Majesty upon it , is any thing contained , that holds out a promise or a pledge , that any inquiry will be instituted , I am persuaded , that gentlemen must feel not alone the propriety but the necessity of agreeing to my motion . The House has heard a noble lord ( Castlereagh ) who is so much concerned in these transactions , express his readiness , nay , his solicitude , to meet inquiry . I will call then , upon that noble lord and upon others , implicated equally with him in this transaction , who are heard to speak with an equal tone of confidence , as to their means of justification , to support me upon this occasion , in my endeavour to afford them an opportunity of redeeming their character—of rescuing themselves from a most severe imputation , by voting for that inquiry , which they have so boldly courted . It is due to that noble lord , therefore , it is in justice due to the administration and to the country at large , that inquiry should be instituted accordingly ; and , as mercy has been disdained , and even penal visitation boldly challenged , that the scrutiny should not be denied nor deferred.—Before I proceed however , to state the grounds upon which this inquiry appears to me indispensibly necessary to answer the ends of justice—to comply with the wishes , and to vindicate the ho- 162 hour of the country , I think it right to anticipate some of the objections usually made to a proposition of this nature , and which are , of course , likely to be brought forward in this instance . I never , indeed , recollect any proposition made in this House , for inquiry , in which something evasive has not been urged on the part of ministers , and I am inclined to apprehend that the desire for inquiry , on this occasion , professed by those , who were ministers—those who are now in office will Contrive , if possible , to elude and to thwart . The objections likely to be made to my motion will , I suppose , apply to the time and the form in which it is submitted . To the latter I will first direct my attention.—My object is , that the inquiry shall be conducted by a Committee of the whole House , because that appears to me the most eligible mode of proceeding ill the investigation of a question of such magnitude and importance . That magnitude and that importance are , indeed , such as to demand the exercise of the highest inquisitorial powers belonging to this House . Considering the sentiment , that universally prevails respecting the conduct and result of this Expedition—considering how loud and strong is the demand of our constituents upon this subject—and let us hope that they will not by any disappointment of their just expectations be urged to address us with mote energy—I can not consent to delegate the right
