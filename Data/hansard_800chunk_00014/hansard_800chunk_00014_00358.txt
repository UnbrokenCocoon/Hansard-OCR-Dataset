the Brazils , and they had to support their army in Spain . In such circumstances it became them to be particularly frugal of their resources , and to present unnecessary waste of grain . He should therefore give his vote for the noble lord 's motion . rose and said : Sir , the right hon . gent , who has just sat down considers the exemption of Ireland as a measure at best called for by her local interests , in opposition to the general interests of the United Kingdoms , and he further seems to think , that the mere circumstance of prohibiting the distilleries in this country involves in itself the necessity of prohibiting it also in the other . Sir , I differ from him on both these grounds ; I think the question of the prohibition as it relates to Ireland , is to be determined by reasons totally distinct from those which are to determine the expediency or inexpediency of continuing it here , and it further appears to me that the repeal of it in Ireland , is called for by the general interests of the Empire more , if possible , than by the local interests of Ireland . It has long been the habit at least , if not the policy of this country to depend upon its 546 neighbours ; not merely for a portion of its sustenance , but for other supplies almost equally indispensable , and the ablest writers have demonstrated the general expediency of procuring them wherever we can procure them cheapest . But all their arguments assume the supposition that some foreign markets shall be open for us to resort to . A whole world closed against us , ( at least almost all the productive part of it ) , is a circumstance which is neither presumed in their arguments , nor could have occurred to their imagination : a spectacle , however , which the awful times in which we live threaten speedily to realise , and with such a prospect before us , in all due deference to the opinions of the economists , I must contend that if we can procure our supplies within ourselves , even if encreased expence is to be the consequence , it is a measure worth the purchase . If I thought that Ireland produced any thing approaching to her maximum of Corn , and that the question really was , now , whether Great Britain should eat or Ireland should distill , God forbid that for any petty considerations , we should withhold our utmost contribution ; but convinced as I am on the contrary , that no one of these countries which have in their turns been characterised as the granaries of nations , but must yield in its powers of production to the hitherto almost untried and still unknown capabilities of Ireland if duly stimulated into operation , and that she presents to you a granary for all your wants if you only determine to employ it , I can not refrain from protesting against that short-sighted policy , which for the sake of a present mouthful , would dry up the sources of future and permanent abundance . Where our judgment is so much to be determined by the extent of what Ireland can produce , it may not be improper the Committee should be imformed that in the course of the last year , after supporting nearly 5 millions of inhabitants , she exported provisions of the value of about three millions sterling , exclusive of 800,000 quarters of corn supplied to this country , and of probably a still greater quantity consumed in her private , distilleries , notwithstanding your prohibition : and I will appeal to every person who has seen the half cultivated fields of Ireland , whether he can entertain a doubt , that if they had the benefit of only the same degree of agriculture which adorns the face of this country , they would produce twice or threefold what is obtained 547 from them at present . I say this of that portion of Ireland
