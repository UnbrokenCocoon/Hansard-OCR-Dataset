France and Spain , in the year 1797 , on the plea of their navi- 410 gating without the role d'equipage required by treaty ; and the seizure of all the British ships in the ports of Russia , by the emperor Paul , in the year 1799 . Had this intended new company been established previous to either of those periods , comprehending within itself , as the proprietors themselves declare it does , 9-10ths of the commercial interest of this metropolis , and of course doing 9-10ths of the business , and sustaining 9-10ths of the losses , it must have been totally ruined . But , the proprietors , sheltered under that limited responsibility which is the great object of their present application to parliament , would still have continued men of opulence : their carriages would still have roiled along the streets , and have splashed with mire the unfortunate individuals , who had been ruined by their insolvency as a company . When these disasters happened , some underwriters certainly failed ; but the number was comparatively small : the blasts that would have torn up this company by the roots , scarcely brought down a leaf from the tree at Lloyd 's . Whether , therefore , we consider the amount of the capital employed at Lloyd 's , or the subdivision of risks attended to by the individual underwriters there , it is obvious that the public security , so far from being augmented , would be diminished , by 9-10ths of the insurance business being transferred to this great and chartered company.â€”It is also asserted , that much litigation would be prevented , and losses be recovered with greater facility and promptitude from this new company than from the underwriters at Lloyd 's , who are accused of being litigious , and even unprincipled , in the defences they set up against just demands . That some individuals have at times availed themselves of points of law , of which underwriters in general have not taken advantage , I admit ; but there are very few men whom interest , if not principle , would not prevent from selling their good name for any sum they could possibly gain by evading the payment of a loss . Underwriters , speaking of them collectively , are much more sinned against than sinning ; no set of men on earth are so much the dupes of fraud and villany . They have paid , not only for vessels purposely lost , but on cargoes of stones and brick bats , packed up as bale goods ; nay , even for vessels which it afterwards appeared never were in existence , though forged invoices , bills of lading , certificates of their having sailed , 411 and every requisite document , were regularly transmitted ; and in order to prevent suspicion , one of the most respectable houses in the city was made the innocent instrument of this nefarious transaction . Such impositions practised upon men naturally tend to make them suspicious , and sometimes they certainly are so without just ground ; but the question is not as to the positive degree of facility with which losses can be recovered at Lloyd 's , but as to the comparative degree of greater facility with which they can be recovered at public offices . It is true that in settling with a public office , the assured has only to settle with a single person , instead of having to settle with the various individuals who have underwritten his policy ; but this task is one which requires neither much time nor trouble , for almost all the parties sit under the same roof , and when the first underwriter on a policy has settled the loss , the others generally follow without any investigation of the papers . On the other hand , public offices are necessarily governed by certain fixed rules , and will not settle without regular documents , the production of which is frequently dispensed with at Lloyd 's . Public offices will not pay on missing ships till the period
