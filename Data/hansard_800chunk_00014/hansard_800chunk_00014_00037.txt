becoming better , is infinitely worse than it was before , and with the honours of a victorious , we experience the fate of a beaten army . It was the art of the great man whom I have mentioned , to render defeat harmless , it is the art of ministers and generals of these days , to make , victory itself unavailing . 50 If we had possessed a wise government , skilful in procuring the best information , and firm enough to act upon it , instead of calculating its measures upon the vulgar ignorant cry of the moment , we probably never should have heard even of the first campaign in Spain . But supposing that another opinion might have been reasonably entertained upon that subject , and that it was necessary both for their own satisfaction , and for the satisfaction of the country , to try at least whether a British army might not have been employed with effect in aid of the Spaniards ; still , when the history and result of that campaign were known , and when the novelty of the case and ignorance of the real state of the country could no longer be pleaded as an excuse , how any man should have advised a second is almost unintelligible . If , indeed , the plan had proceeded from some of those romantic persons , for such these were , whose imaginations heated upon this subject had completely extinguished all the other faculties of their minds , one should not have been surprised . But , that , to do them justice , was neither the character nor the feeling of his Majesty 's ministers , least of all for instance of the noble lord , who then presided over the war department ; a man of a calm mind , not liable so far as I know to be infected with the contagion of popular enthusiasm , not a person whom the mere name of patriotism was likely to transport into any acts of imprudent zeal , or who might be expected to make immoderate sacrifices in the cause of national independence . We must , therefore , look for some other explanation of the conduct of the noble lord and his colleagues , and the explanation of it , I believe , is to be found , and to be found only in that vague determination to do something , no matter what , and to keep the public force employed , no matter how , which formed one of the main principles , and let me add , one of the most mischievous principles of their administration ; that principle too upon which they were most directly and most ostentatiously committed against their opponents . It is this which has been to them instead of prejudice , instead of enthusiasm , instead of folly , and which has precipitated them into all those acts which more resemble the desperation of a losing gamester , than the deliberate plans of a government . To that principle we owe that other great event of the last year , the Expedi- 51 tion to Walcheren . Upon that subject , Sir , I shall not trouble the House at any considerable length , both because I am unwilling to take up your time , and because it is really difficult to speak upon such a question , with that command of temper and that moderation of language , which become any person that has the honour to address you . For , whether we consider the plan , the object , the person to whom the execution of it was entrusted , our history does not afford an example of any thing so disgraceful or so absurd . The object of this memorable enterprize is understood to have been two-fold : first , and principally to seize the ships and destroy the arsenal at Antwerp ; and in the next place , and collaterally , to make a diversion in favour of Austria ; Austria to which in her last struggle we have not been able to afford the
