professions ; In peaceable submission to the laws , and in the discharge of moral or civil duty , they have not been 556 exceeded by any of his Majesty 's subjects ; they have served him effectively and honourably in his fleets and armies ; there never has been a call upon Englishmen to do their duty , which the English Roman Catholics have not been forward to answer ; and that several penal and disabling laws are yet in force against them : They are not equally entitled with their fellow subjects to vote at the election of any member of the House , and they are excluded from a seat in either House of parliament ; they are not admissible into corporations ; every civil and military office is denied them , every laudable object of ambition , all that elevates a man among his fellow subjects , all hopes of public distinction , all means of attracting the notice of their country , or the favour of their sovereign , are placed without their reach ; and the more they deserve of their country , the more sensibly their country makes them feel this exclusion : In the ranks , she suffers them to fight her battles , but to them victory is without its reward ; promotion is wholly denied them ; no services can advance , no merit enable them to meet their country 's favour ; and , even in their humble situation of private soldiers , the law follows them with pains and penalties ; and , by the articles of war , if soldiers refuse to attend the religious worship of the established church , they are punishable by fine , imprisonment , and death : Thus the English Catholic soldiers are incessantly exposed to the cruel alternative of either making a sacrifice of their religion , or incurring the extreme of legal punishment , than which the Petitioners humbly conceive there never has been , and can not be , a more direct religious persecution ; and to an alternative equally oppressive the English Roman Catholics are exposed on their marriages : The law requires for the legal validity of a marriage in England that it should be celebrated in a parish church ; as Roman Catholics believe marriage to be a sacrament , the English Roman Catholics naturally feel great repugnance to a celebration of their marriages in other churches than their own ; and they are cruelly debarred from any means which their fellow subjects possess of providing for their families by employments of honour or emolument , so that , while they bear their full share of the general contribution to the wants of the state , they are denied even a hope of participating in those advantages by which the burthen of their fellow sub- 557 jects is alleviated ; and in other occurrences of life , the law has the same humiliating and depressing operation on the Petitioners : Thus every Roman Catholic subject of his Majesty is forced below his fair line in society , and the general body is a marked and insulated cast , yet the Roman Catholics form more than one fourth of the whole mass of the subjects of the United Empire : Whatever there is of genius , of talent , or of energy among them , is absolutely lost for public use , and this at a time when the United Empire is engaged in a conflict formidable beyond example ; and it therefore seems important , if not essential , to her preservation , that she should call into action , without qualification or limit , or any religious test or declaration , the genius , talents , and energies of all her subjects : It is true that the Petitioners profess some religious principles which are not professed by the established church , and to this , and to this only , their refusal of certain tests , oaths , and declarations is owing , which subjects them to the pains and disabilities they complain of ; but none of the , principles which occasion their
