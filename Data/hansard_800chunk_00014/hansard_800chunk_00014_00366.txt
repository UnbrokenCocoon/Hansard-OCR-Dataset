refusal affects their moral , civil , or political integrity ; and the Petitioners humbly submit to the House , that no principle which leaves moral or political integrity unimpaired is a proper object of religious persecution ; besides , the whole creed of the Petitioners was once the creed of the three kingdoms ; it is the actual creed of four fifths of Ireland , and of much the greater part of Europe : It was the creed of those who founded British liberty at Runeymeade , who conquered at Cressy , Poictiers , and Agincourt : among those who repelled and annihilated the Spanish Armada none bore a nobler part than those by whom this creed was professed ; and in all those achievements , in every other scene in which the ancient valour or ancient wisdom of this country has been displayed , the ancestors of several of the Petitioners have been distinguished ; their creed did not lessen their zeal for their king and country , it does not lessen that of their descendants ; and every disloyal or immoral principle , which malice or credulity has imputed to them , the Petitioners have solemnly and repeatedly disclaimed ; they believe there does not now exist an honourable man who imputes these principles to them : they have sworn to be faithful and bear true allegiance to his Majesty , and have acted up to their professions ; 558 they most confidently appeal to the House and to the whole empire , whether in loyalty to his Majesty , attachment to the constitution , or zeal for their country 's good , they are not equal , and are not universally known and acknowledged to be equal , to his Majesty 's other subjects ; therefore , conscious of the truth of these representations , and with the most perfect reliance on the wisdom and justice of the House , the Petitioners humbly pray for a total repeal of every test , oath , declaration , or provision , which has the effect of subjecting the Petitioners to any penalty or disability whatsoever on account of their religious principles .

'' And the said Petitions were severally ordered to lie upon the table . in rising to make the motion of which lie gave notice , observed , that as many more members were then present 559 than wore in the House when lord Chatham 's examination before the Committee closed on the preceding evening , he would state some circumstances which
