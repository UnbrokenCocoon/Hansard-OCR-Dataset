it displayed in the battle , he still must , in the execution of his duty as a member of that House , and for the reasons he had stated , oppose the motion now under consideration . replied to the noble earl who had just sat down . If it was painful , he said , to the noble earl to perform a public duty by opposing the present motion , and that it was really painful to him would be readily believed by all who knew the honourable feelings which belonged to the character of that noble earl , the generosity of his nature , the liberality of his sentiments , and his proud descent from a person so highly distinguished for military talents and services : how painful must be the situation in which he stood , who could not but be open to private feeling , while he also had a public duty to perform : who had to vindicate the character and conduct of so 146 near and dear a relation as a brother ; of an officer whose eminent qualities he had had such frequent opportunities of observing , qualities of which whatever opinion it might please the noble earl to entertain , were attested by the universal voice of the officers and soldiers of the armies he had commanded , and of the countries in whose defence they had been exerted : of Portugal where he was almost adored , and where he was invested with power little short of royal : and of Spain , where he was equally beloved by the people , and respected by the government . In standing forward on the present occasion in defence of lord Wellington , he might safely contend that his noble relative had taken a judicious view of the objects which he had to accomplish ; of the means which he possessed for their accomplishment ; and of the mode in which these means were to be applied . On these public grounds he was willing to try and rest the merits of lord Wellington , and confident of their strength , he would endeavour as far as possible to discharge his mind from the influence of all private feeling.â€”And now in the outset he must beg leave to observe that the noble earl did not seem very clearly to understand the objects of lord Wellington 's operations . They were briefly these : His first thoughts were directed to the situation of Portugal . On the arrival of his brother in that country , he found that the enemy were not only in possession of its northern provinces , but that they manifested a disposition to advance into the south . It was indeed evident that the French did not intend to act merely on the defensive : but that they had formed a plan by which , Soult and Victor were to advance from , different points . The first object , therefore , of lord Wellington , was the deliverance of Portugal ; and on the praise of the operation by which he expelled Soult , it was not necessary for him to dwell . In the eyes of all Portugal and of every military man , it was an operation as able , as active , as rapid and conclusive as any which the page of military history records . It was therefore surely unfair , as some noble lords have done , to describe such an operation merely as an affair with the rear-guard of Soult 's corps . Having thus achieved the expulsion of Soult from the north of Portugal , lord Wellington proceeded to the south to oppose Victor , who had actually advanced in that direction , but who on the approach of lord 147 Wellington had thought it prudent to retreat . But here again lord Wellington was reproached with a delay of 10 days at Abrantes . This was another misconception , which it was proper to rectify , for in point of fact the delay imputed to his noble brother , was not protracted a moment beyond what was absolutely necessary ,
