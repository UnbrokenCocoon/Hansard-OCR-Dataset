objects of its attention , and that no class of men can , without an infraction of the spirit and essence of the British constitution , be deprived of any of their rights , civil or political , by the act of writing for the newspapers , which are published in this free country.—That , some time previous to the year 1S07 , your Petitioner was a writer for several of the newspapers , and , from his literary exertions in that capacity , derived considerable emoluments . And your Petitioner humbly suggests , as the result of his information and belief , that some of the most accomplished scholars , eminent lawyers , and enlightened statesmen , who have ever adorned society , or sat as representatives of the Commons of the united kingdom , in your honourable House , have been persons who , in the early period of their lives , have written for hire in the newspapers , and other periodical publications.—That the benchers of the honourable society of Lincoln 's Inn , have , as your Petitioner submits , violated the principles of the constitution of the united kingdom , and usurped the powers of the legislature , by making a rule , or bye-law , to the following effect—'1807 . That no person , who has written for hire , in the newspapers , shall be admitted to do exercises to entitle him to be called to the bar .

This is the only restriction which shall ever have my concurrence . I have to add , that this regulation has been sent to all the other Inns of Court , and that every one of them has refused to adopt it . after a few prefatory observations , presented a Petition from the Roman Catholics of England , setting forth , `` That the Petitioners beg leave to represent to the House , that , at the time of his Majesty 's accession to the throne , the laws in force against his Roman Catholic subjects deprived them of most of the rights of Englishmen , and of several of the common rights of mankind ; ; and that , by the acts of the 18th and 31st years of his Majesty 's reign , several of the penalties and disabilities under which the English Roman Catholics laboured were removed ; and that the English Roman Catholics are most grateful for the relief granted them by those acts , and have taken and subscribed the oaths and declarations contained in them ; and that their conduct hath been conformable to their
