as it were , into one focus at Lloyd 's . On this conviction the public offices , very wisely , refuse to undertake what they do not understand ; and wholly decline the only species of competition with Lloyd 's , which could in the smallest degree conduce to the public advantage.â€”Another argument urged in favour of establishing this new company is , that greater security is offered to the public by them , than can be given by individual underwriters . It is not necessary for me to undertake to disprove particular instances that may be brought forward of the insolvency of underwriters , or to contend that they are immaculate as a body , either in property or character ; but , this I will assert , that a man who suffers by the insolvency of underwriters at Lloyd 's , suffers , generally speaking , strange as it may appear , with his own concurrence . A broker will tell his merchant , that he can not complete his insurance with good men , unless he will give a higher premium . The answer frequently is , you must not give more , for such a house has effected the same risk at the same premium ; therefore , get the best names you can ; and thus the merchant frequently sets the advantage to be gained by the reduction of premium , against the risk to be run from the want 409 of solidity in the underwriters . No merchant who offers a fair premium , and whose business is transacted by brokers of respectability , is ever under the necessity of taking a doubtful name on his policy ; and I maintain , that Lloyd 's offers better security to the assured than can be given by any chartered company . I say so , for this plain reason , that every man at Lloyd 's is responsible for his engagements to the last shilling of his fortune , while the members of an incorporated company are responsible only for the amount of the capital originally invested ; and the capital of the underwriters at Lloyd 's infinitely exceeds that of any chartered company whatever . For instance : the capital of this new company is intended to be five millions , of which only one million , I understand , is to be actually advanced . In point of fact , then , the one million so advanced , is the whole extent of the security offered to the public ; for though the original subscribers to this undertaking are men of fortune and able to pay the other four millions in case of need , yet they , from various motives , may be induced to sell out , and may sell to men of straw , mere speculators , who would not be able to pay the other four millions . But giving them the whole advantage of this argument , and taking their capital at five millions , that sum bears no proportion to the aggregate capital of the underwriters at Lloyd 's ; for could name fifty out of the 1,500 subscribers to that house , who could pay down these five millions at any time , without the smallest inconvenience , leaving the capital of the other 1,450 subscribers wholly untouched . Events have occurred within these few years , that would have more than swallowed up the capital of this company , and yet have scarcely occasioned the failure of a single individual at Lloyd 's ; for every prudent underwriter regularly classes all his risks , and proportions the amount he hazards on those of each particular description to his means of payment in case of loss ; a precaution which could not possibly be observed in the vast mass of business that would be undertaken by this new company . The events to which I allude , are the detentions and subsequent condemnation of the Dutch ships , in consequence of the hostilities that took place between this country and Holland , in the year 1794 ; the capture and condemnation of American vessels by
