they ought never to be granted , but in order to procure some advantage for the public , which can not be procured by any other means . To use the words of lord Coke , ( 3rd Inst . 184 ) , `` there must be , urgens necessitas , et `` evident utilitas . '' These pleas have been justly admitted in the case of several corporations lately established , not only in this metropolis , but in the out-ports ; I mean the Dock Companies . The urgent necessity and evident utility , of giving adequate security to the public revenue and to private property , was so strongly felt , that Parliament thought it advisable to encourage these undertakings , by the exclusive privilege of warehousing certain commodities , at certain rates , for a certain , period ; but at the same time , with a due regard to the interests of individuals , they indemnified every description of persons who might be deprived of their accustomed occupations and profits by this new change of system . If we try the merits of the petition now before the House , by the principles here laid down , it is impossible that we can accede to it ; for no case has been made out , either of urgent necessity or evident utility . The parties merely propose to do that as a company , for their own emolument , which is already done by individuals ; and this , too , without making any provision to compensate those who would be deprived of their present means of subsistence , by the intended innovation.—It has been urged in favour of the present application , that the preamble of the Act of 6th Geo . 1 , by which the two Marine Insurance Companies now existing were established , expresses itself in language favourable to chartered and joint stock companies . If , however , we look into the history of that Act , we shall find that the application of these companies for a charter , was in the first instance rejected : but that the civil list being soon afterwards much in arrear , and the proprietors offering 600,000l to supply this deficiency , the minister of the 403 day , anxious to provide means for defraying the too lavish expenditure of the court , without imposing new burdens on the people , exerted all his influence in favour of the measure ; and that then this Act was carried through the House . Thus the existing companies owe their establishment to a job ; and this surely is no very great recommendation to the pretensions of any new companies of a similar description.—Indeed , although the preamble of this Act justifies the establishment of these two companies , in consequence of the numerous failures which had then recently taken place among the underwriters ( a consideration by no means applicable to the present times ) , yet , in the subsequent clauses , it provides that his Majesty may revoke their charters , if they are found inconvenient of hurtful to the public ; enacts , that no other such corporations shall ever be established ; and recognizes the general principle , that all joint stock companies `` manifestly tend to the common grievance , prejudice , and inconvenience of great numbers of his Majesty 's subjects , in their trade or commerce , and their other affairs ; '' ' declares them to be public nuisances ; and parties engaged in joint stock companies without the sanction of the legislature , are liable to prosecutions under this very Act.—If we refer to other Parliamentary authorities , we shall find that grants of exclusive or particular privileges , have ever been viewed by our ancestors with great jealousy , and have frequently excited their just reprehension . In the reign of queen Elizabeth , the House of Commons voted such grants to be breaches of the privileges of the people ; and the Queen , in consequence , annulled the greater number of them , and subjected the rest to the controul of the
