most anxious to set right—I do not mean to say , that Mr. Jackson has directly asserted that Mr. Erskine was ordered to give an explanation to the American government of the reasons which had influenced his Majesty 's minister to disavow the arrangement he had made ; but if he is not to be considered as asserting , at least he insinuates it so strongly , that I am bound on the part of my hon . relation to say , that he was not ordered to give that explanation—that he was not authorized to give it either directly or indirectly : and I am the more anxious to state this , because reasons were assigned for his having withheld it , of a private and personal nature ; he is supposed to have withheld it from some delicacy attaching to the peculiar situation in which he found himself from the disavowal ; nay , more , he is supposed to have relied on the goodness of the President , as affording him an excuse in that respect . What is this , in other words , but saying , that he was guilty of a dereliction of his public duty from some considerations which were purely personal to himself ; and how is this charge aggravated when that explanation having been withheld , is one of the principal complaints made by the American government ; so that from some supposed personal motive he has abstained from the discharge of his public duty , and by so doing , has increased the irritation already excited in that country ? What is the House to think , when I state that he was not ordered or authorized to make the communication , and that under the circumstances in which he was placed , to have made that communication 113 without order or authority , would have been to the last degree indecorous or unjustifiable ? From Mr Jackson 's mode of describing that explanation , too , it does not seem as if the communication of it was likely to have conciliated the American government . The forcible terms in which it was said to have been conveyed , do not sound as if they were likely to have allayed the resentment , or soothed the feelings of the American government ; but whether they were or not , he had no discretion given to him upon the subject ; and to make a charge upon him for having kept back this explanation , from motives of a private nature , is to inflict a wound upon his reputation . I do not mean to lay any imputation upon Mr. Jackson . I must presume he acted according to the best of his judgment in the discharge of his public duty ; but , Sir , I deny that any motives for embarrassment existed , or any cause from which it could have arisen—that Mr. Erskine had hoped to have considered himself the instrument of his Majesty 's government , for allaying the animosity which had unhappily prevailed between Great Britain and America , is most true ; that he had hoped to bring about , with due attention to his instructions , a re-union between two countries connected by ties of blood , by identity of interests , by congenial sentiments of liberty , at a time when the very name of it is banished from the rest of the civilized world ; that he had hoped to have accomplished this , not a tame , passive re-union , but one which would lead to cordial , active co-operation against France ; that this was a proud object of ambition , and that he was humbled , mortified , and grieved when he found that he had failed , I am free to admit ; that his being thus mistaken in his view of what were the wishes of his Majesty 's government , and that this mistake was painful to him in the extreme , I believe ; but that there were any other sentiments , or any ideas of delicacy or embarrassment , which induced him to
