is expired when the loss can be recovered by law ; the underwriters pay without insisting on this delay , on an undertaking from the assured , that if the vessel should hereafter appear , he will put them in the same situation as if the loss had never been settled . Claims of liberality , which could not be maintained by law and which could not , perhaps , with propriety be admitted by the directors of a public company , acting for others , are frequently admitted at Lloyd 's by individuals , each of whom is acting for himself . But , it is said that underwriters frequently go to law in order to put off the payment of losses , and that in such cases an action must be brought against each individual ; whereas , if the insurance was effected with a public office , a single action would decide the contest , and thus much money now spent in litigation would be saved . That much money is now unnecessarily spent in litigation the underwriters know to their cost , for it is spent at their expence . The solicitor to the assured commences proceedings against every underwriter ; the underwriters apply for a rule to consolidate , which the judge grants on condition of their paying all the charges hitherto in- 412 curred , and these fall so heavy , that an underwriter , where a case is doubtful , will frequently rather pay than litigate the demand . The public offices are not influenced by this consideration in the same degree , for they can contest a loss of 100,000l . at as little expence as an individual underwriter can contest his subscription of 100l . ; and it is not very reasonable to expect that those parties will be least disposed to be litigious who have the strongest temptation to be so , unless we believe the directors of this new intended Marine Insurance Company not to be men of like passions with ourselves.—One of the allegations in the petition of this intended new company is , `` that the trade and commerce of these kingdoms have increased so much since the two existing companies were incorporated , that these two companies do not at present insure more than three parts in one hundred of the ships , goods , and merchandize insured in Great Britain . '' On this it may be observed , that if the trade and commerce of these kingdoms have increased , the number of underwriters has increased in a still greater proportion ; for the number of subscribers to Lloyd 's in the year 1771 was only 79 , and the present number is near 1,500 . The small proportion of insurance business effected by the public companies , shews the general preference given by the commercial world to individual underwriters ; and is the strongest proof that could possibly be adduced , not only of more moderate rate of premiums at which they transact business , but of the general confidence placed both in their probity and solidity—The petitioners also state , `` that several insurance companies have been established in the East and West Indies , and America ; '' and seem to wish to have it inferred , that these companies have been established for want of more insurance companies in Great Britain . Insurance is a natural appendage to commerce ; and the establishment of insurance companies , or of individual underwriters , in every commercial country , may be sufficiently accounted for , by the desire merchants feel to transact their own business , rather than pay a commission for having it transacted by others ; and the satisfaction they derive from holding in their own hands the policies of insurance by which their property is secured , instead of confiding the important trust of recovering upon them , in case of loss , to their foreign correspondents . In- 413 dependent of these general considerations , circumstances of a local and peculiar nature , will shew the indispensable necessity of such establishments being formed , in all the countries
