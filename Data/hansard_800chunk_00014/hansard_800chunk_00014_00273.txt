named by the petitioners . In the East Indies , opportunities of writing to England for insurance occur so seldom , that many voyages , more particularly those from one port to another , or country voyages as they are called , must be insured upon the spot , or not at all . It is also to be considered , that parties resident in India , if they insure there , recover a loss without delay ; but if they insure in Great Britain , they can not recover , and realize their funds , in less than eighteen months or two years ; and this circumstance , coupled with the high rate of interest paid for money in India , will account for their preferring to insure there rather than in Europe : nor would the inducement so to do be at all lessened , by the establishment of this , or any other new insurance companies . In the West Indies , vessels going from one island to another , or from any of the islands to America must be insured there unless one of the packets , which sail only once a month , should happen to be on the eve of her departure when the voyage commences ; otherwise the issue of it may be known in England before the order for insurance arrives there . With respect to America , it is not to be expected that a country rising so fast into commercial importance , should form none of those establishments by which alone commerce can be secured ; and it is also to be remarked , that our law-prohibiting the insurance of enemies ' property , not only prevents property really belonging to the enemy , but property liable to be suspected of belonging to the enemy , from being insured here ; for as British underwriters can not pay in case of British capture , parties whose vessels are brought in for adjudication , might , if they insured here , be ruined for want of their funds while the cause was pending , and therefore they insure in countries where there is no bar to their immediate recovery . From these observations , it appears that the extension of the insurance business in America is to be attributed to various causes , but more particularly to this law , which sacrifices commerce to policy ; and that the case would not be altered by the establishment of this new company , unless , which I can not suppose , they mean to insure against British capture , in violation of the law of the land.—The only ad- 414 vantage that I can discern in the establishment of this new company , is an advantage of which the gentlemen concerned have told us nothing , but which I shall now endeavour to develope ; the advantage that would accrue to themselves . Their plan is to unite a very great proporportion of the leading mercantile houses in this metropolis into a company , for the purpose of effecting their own marine insurances ; and thus to retain , and divide among themselves , the emoluments hitherto made by the insurance brokers and underwriters at Lloyd 's . They would retain the profit of the brokers , by effecting their own insurances at their own office ; and as proprietors of that office , they would also divide among themselves the profit of the underwriters . They propose , too , acting on a scale hitherto unprecedented in point of extent and magnitude . Thus , by the boldness of their speculations , their profits may be increased to an almost incalculable amount ; while their losses can not possibly exceed the sum they offer to invest as the capital of their undertaking.—Before the House give their sanction to this measure , I trust they will seriously listen to the objections that offer both on public and private grounds , to the carrying it into effect.—The first objection that I shall state , is founded on its interference with the rights of individuals .
