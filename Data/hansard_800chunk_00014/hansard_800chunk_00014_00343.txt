, would conjure their lordships , but for a different object , to call to mind the losses that had been sustained ; not that they should go on in the fruitless profusion of lives and treasure , but that they should , whilst there was yet time , arrest the fatal progress of national calamity and disgrace . He should conjure their lordships not to lend themselves to such a system , in order that new millions should be squandered , that fresh thousands should be sacrificed ; but to take care that no time should be suffered to elapse , before they obliged the government to pursue such measures as would be best calculated to promote the national interest , by enhancing the national character and honour . He particularly called upon their lordships not to suffer the remnant of our brave army to be exposed to the same disastrous fate which had befallen the armies already sacrificed . He trusted that their lordships would come to that determination which all , who felt for the hardships of our brave army , —who valued the lives of our valiant soldiers , —who were anxious for the honour and true interests of their country—must approve , They had but 522 to bear in mind the useless sacrifices which bad been made without any possibility of any advantageous result : —the destination of sir John Moore 's army to the North ; when that general was of opinion that it should have been sent to the South of Spain : —the loss of 6,000 men in that calamitous campaign ; —the loss of 6,000 more in the late campaign under lord Wellington ; and all the fruitless waste of treasure that must have been incurred in both these disastrous campaigns . Were their lordships to be told , after all that had happened , that as his Majesty 's ministers alone entertained any hope upon the result , they were still to go on in the indulgence of expectations of future success in Spain , and under that vain , that idle and delusive impression to expose still more of the valuable lives of British troops ? The Portuguese soldiers , upon whom so much dependence was to be placed , might perhaps hereafter become good troops , and be capable of acting in concert with regular armies . But when their lordships looked to the weak and imbecile state of their disorganised government ; —when they considered that all the energies of the nation were extinguished by the spirit of that government in which the people could place no confidence , their lordships must be convinced of the total impossibility of obtaining any native force in Portugal , competent to effectual co-operation with a British army . When the British army had first entered Spain , it was to have been supported by a Spanish force of 30,000 men , but throughout the whole of its disastrous progress in that country , the British army experienced no co-operation . To expect , therefore , any effectual cooperation from a Portuguese army , in the case under consideration , would be to set all experience at defiance—to derive no benefit from the lessons they had received during the late operations—and madly to expose the best interests of the army and state to imminent but unprofitable hazard . Yet with such facts in view , the foundation of the proposition before their lordships was the expectation of that co-operation , which had not been experienced in either of the two former expeditions . But though so much was to depend upon the state , the amount and efficiency of this native army , the noble secretary was not yet acquainted with its actual condition . A force of 30,000 men was to be provided for ; but it did not appear that more than 16,000 of them were actually in existence . Was it then to be supposed , that this small force 523 could , in the short interval between the present moment and the period when the trial would be to be made , be augmented to 30,000 ,
