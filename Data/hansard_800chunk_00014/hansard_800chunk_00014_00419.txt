They had taken the earliest opportunity of alledging their complaints , in order that they might be heard by counsel at the bar of the House . Their lordships were in the habit of permitting those who petitioned to be heard by counsel , and he trusted the same indulgence would be allowed the present petitioners . For this purpose , he hoped the noble earl would have no objection to 643 postpone the present motion for the second reading , and , therefore , he should move `` That the order of the day be discharged , end that the Bill be read a second time on Monday .
