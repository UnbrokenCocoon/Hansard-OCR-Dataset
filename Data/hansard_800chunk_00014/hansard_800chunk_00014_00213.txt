Petition ; and they state that the Roman Catholics constitute the most numerous and increasing portion of the inhabitants of Ireland , comprising an immense majority of the trading , agricultural , and manufacturing interests , and amounting to at least four-fifths of the Irish population ; that they contribute largely to the exigencies of their country , civil and military ; that they pay the greater part of the public and local taxes , and even defray the charges of building and repairing Protestant houses of worship , and of maintaining in affluence the ministers of the Protestant religion ; that they supply the armies and navies of the Empire with upwards of one third part in number of the soldiers and sailors employed in the public service ; and that notwithstanding heavy discouragements , they form the principal constituent part of the strength , wealth , and industry of Ireland ; yet such is the grievous operation of those penal laws , of which they complain , that the Roman Catholics are thereby not only set apart from their fellow subjects as aliens in this their native land , but are ignominiously and rigorously proscribed from almost all situations of public trust , honour or emolument , including every public function and department from the houses of legislature down to the most petty corporations ; and they state that wherever public duty , arduous and unprofitable , is to be exacted and enforced , the Catholic is sought out and selected for its performance ; where honours or rewards are to be dispensed , he is neglected or contemned ; where public burthens and taxes , of what kind soever , are to be imposed and levied , the Catholic is distinguished by the weight of impost ; but where emolument or subsistence is to flow from those taxes , all clause of beneficial participation is closed against his hopes ; when the military and naval strength of the empire is to be recruited , the Catholics are eagerly invited , nay compelled to bear at least their full share in the perils of warfare , and in the lowest ranks ; but when preferment and promotion , the dear and legitimate prize of successful valour , are to be distributed as rewards of merit , no laurels are destined to grace a Catholic brow , or to fit the wearer for command ; â€”the petitioners state thus , generally the condition of the 322 Roman Catholics , occasioned solely by the fatal influence and operation of those penal laws ; and , though they forbear to detail particular instances , yet they do not the less trust to the influence of reason and justice , which eventually must prevail for effecting in their favour a full and deliberate enquiry into their grievances and finally accomplishing their effectual relief ; and that the petitioners do beg leave , however , most solemnly to press upon the attention of the House the imminent public dangers which necessarily result from so inverted an order of things and so vicious and unnatural a system of legislation , a system which has long been the reproach of these nations , and is unparalleled throughout modern Christendom ; and they state it as their fixed opinion , that to impart to the Roman Catholics of these realms a full , equal , and unqualified participation in the benefits of the laws and constitution of England , and to withdraw all the privations , restrictions , and vexatious distinctions which oppress , injure , and afflict them in their country , is now become a measure not merely expedient but absolutely necessary , not only a debt of right due to a complaining people , but perhaps the last remaining resource of this empire ; and therefore praying the House to take into their most serious consideration the nature , extent , and operation of the aforesaid penal laws , and by repealing the same altogether , to restore to the Roman Catholics of these , realms those liberties so long withheld , and their due share in that constitution which they in common
