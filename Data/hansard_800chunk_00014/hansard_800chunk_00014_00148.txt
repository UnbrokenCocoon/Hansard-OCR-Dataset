decide justly ; and on which the court martial could not decide for us . Indeed , sir , even in lord Gambier 's written defence , we might find his lordship 's pretension to our thanks , which would be some satisfaction ; for in the sentence pronounced by the court , and offered as a ground , on which to rest our judgment , I protest I can find no claim . I shall go farther , Sir , and , though it is not the object to criminate , by the production of their Minutes , yet , Sir , I shall boldly assert , that the charge of delay will be found , not only to have been proved by the witnesses produced , but admitted also by his lordship 's written defence ; a delay of four hours elapsed , by the noble lord 's own account , even before he took up the position , which he has stated to be the best , for observing the motions of the enemy , and for sending ships to the attack , and five hours afterwards elapsed before any attack was made , which is in direct opposition to the sentence delivered by the court ; —if a court it can be called , when it appeared so extraordinary that the president could not give it a name , as he always spoke of it ambiguously ; thus , `` what may be termed , '' or , `` what may be called the prosecution . '' Not only do I assert , Sir , that the charge has been admitted by his 222 lordship , and proved by witnesses ; but his lordship 's written defence , also , will be found to contradict itself in points on which the charge hinged , and in others of material import : that his lordship 's official letters contradict that defence , and each other ; and that many of the witnesses falsify their own evidence in substantive facts , and contradict themselves when deposing only to the best of their knowledge . In other instances they swear positively to things , of the truth of which they had no knowledge , which I believe is an offence against the law . The fabricated chart , Sir , will then also come under review ; that chart produced by the master of the Caledonia to the court , in order to explain the various positions of the British and French fleets , `` on and previous to the 12th of April , '' for the purpose of inducing the members , assembled on `` what may be called '' the trial of lord Gambier , to believe , that no more of the French ships could have been destroyed than were destroyed , had the British force been sent in at an earlier period ; although the fabricator of that chart , after having , on his first examination , sworn that it was a chart of the 12th , swears afterwards that it was meant for the 13th , inasmuch as that `` the only vessels marked on the chart for the 12th , were those that had been destroyed ; '' —those , Sir , that did not exist.—I have one word more to say , respecting the falsity of this vile fabrication , which the master of the Caledonia professes to have copied from the Neptune François . The distance between the shoals are contracted to little more than one-third of the size of the Neptune , from which , as I have already remarked , it is declared to have been taken , in order to shew ( for there can be no other reason ) that the space for anchorage , as deposed by the masters , without knowledge of the fact , was confined ; the water round it shoal , and the passage narrow ; and that the British ships must have been within point blank range , `` not only of the destructive broadsides of the two ships afloat , but of the upright ones on shore , and
