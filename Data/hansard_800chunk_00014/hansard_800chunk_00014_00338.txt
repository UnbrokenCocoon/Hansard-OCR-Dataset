but the last persons from whom he should have expected to 514 hear it so praised were those who had constantly and unalterably hitherto condemned it . He was glad , however , to find them now applauding what they before thought proper to reprobate ; and he congratulated his Majesty 's ministers , their lordships and the public , upon this even late return to the principles of truth and justice . But there was one part of the case to which he had alluded , which had been passed over by his noble friend , and that was , that in the instructions given to the military commanders on that occasion , they were restricted from acting , unless they had a reasonable prospect of success ; and here they came to the main gist and matter of the question of the present day . Would any one say , that in the present situation of affairs in Portugal and Spain , there was the least ground of rational expectation of success ? In the former instance , France was fully occupied in another quarter ; the situation of Europe was far different then from its situation , at the present moment ; and there was at that period every reason to hope , that a manifestation of a determination to defend Portugal would have the effect , as it really had at the time , of delaying the attack upon that kingdom . Would any one say , in the present instance , that the British army in Portugal , aided by the native force which it was now proposed to provide for by a subsidy , would be sufficient to retard or finally to resist such an attack ? What reliance could any man place on this subsidiary force , unaccustomed to the use of aims , unpractised in the operations of war , and wholly ignorant of military discipline , except the little they might have learned from a few British officers ? That Portugal could be defended by such a force , was a thing absolutely impossible ; and therefore it was that he perceived with regret , that a measure of such , not only questionable , but defective policy , should have been the first official act , as he might consider it , of his noble friend . But to return back to the question . He had never denied nor attempred to deny , I that Portugal presented a favourable situation from which to assist and encourage the efforts and the spirit of the people of Spain . His objection to the policy and measures of his Majesty 's ministers , had always been , that the system of occupying Portugal with that view had been departed from ; and that instead of keeping 515 the British army in a concentrated state , in a commanding situation , and at all times applicable to any operations which might be undertaken with a good prospect of success , the British forces had been divided , and diverted to useless , or worse than useless expeditions . When the noble Secretary stated , that it was impossible for the British army to land at Corunna , he seemed to forget that that army which landed at Lisbon had been afterwards marched to Corunna , under circumstances of great calamity and disaster , in prosecution of an operation under all the circumstances of the case hopeless , which the able officer who had the command , had the candour to declare he disapproved of , and which terminated in the loss to the country of that highly distinguished general and thousands of his brave army.â€”But it was not his intention on that occasion to enter into the consideration of the proceedings during the campaign in Spain , as an opportunity for the discussion of that subject would afterwards present itself . It might undoubtedly have been a question whether it was desirable to station a British army in Portugal , a country which had at that time been abandoned by its prince , and left without any legitimate authority or regular government .
