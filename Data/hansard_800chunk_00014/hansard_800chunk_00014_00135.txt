then wait until the person suspected or accused should think proper to tell his storyâ€”It had been said that the object of the motion was to turn out the present ministers . How could inquiry turn out ministers , unless the result of the inquiry should shew them to be criminal ? Why should his learned friend be apprehensive that the result of inquiry , would be so fatal to an administration of which he was disposed to think so well ? If , on the contrary , the inquiry should prove that no blame attached to them , they would only be more firmly established in their places in consequence of it . When it was argued that it was of very little importance whether inquiry should be voted this night or on Monday ; he would then ask why , if it were of so little importance , ministers thought it worth while to give a serious opposition ? He would ask , was there an individual present who had heard his majesty 's ministers , and was not perfectly convinced that it was their intention , if they could by any means 199 evade it , that there should be no inquiry ? Was not the course they were taking precisely the course which was the best calculated to evade inquiry ? Was there any man of those who knew what the papers were that ministers intended to produce , who had the boldness to say , that even in his judgment , those papers would be satisfactory to the House and the public ? If , in fact , it were only a question of 24 hours , he would say , that it was better to vote for enquiry now , and not to delay such a vote even for 24 hours . The House was then on its trial before the world , and should lose no time in acquitting itself in the eyes of the country . By giving impunity to ministers in cases of former failures , they had given them confidence to bring fresh disasters on the country . It Was on the heads of the members of that House therefore that those calamities should rest : it was against them that the cries and reproaches of the widows and orphans of those who were sent through inglorious perils to an inglorious death in Walcheren should be directed , if they did not take the most prompt and effectual means of visiting those calamities on the heads of the guilty authors , whoever they might be . It was said , that any thing that would prevent the Chancellor of the Exchequer from being the minister of the country would leave the King without a defender . What could it be said that in a country where his Majesty had not one personal enemy it was absolutely necessary that the present Chancellor of the Exchequer should be his defender ? He thought there was no symptom more alarming , than to find that the vote of that House was often in opposition to the decided opinion of the public at large ; and more especially , when it was known that many members professed out of doors opinions directly contrary to what was expressed by their votes in that House . When they were in the country among their neighbours , they were almost all for inquiry ; but when they came up to town , they too often voted for the ministers . said he conceived , that , though there was strong presumption of misconduct in some quarter , it would be too much to vote for inquiry without the information which the papers might give . As the production of these papers would lake place very shortly , he saw no objection to accede to the wishes of his 200 right hon . friend . He thought there was no question which ought less to be judged of by the disastrous event than the Expedition to Walcheren ; and that they could not be led to the fair consideration of the subject , if guided only by the
