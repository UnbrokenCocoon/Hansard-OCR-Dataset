Rutland '' the smallest , and `` Yorkshire '' the largest County , `` returned the same number of representatives . '' `` That Cornwall , '' which by the census taken by order of parliament appears to contain a population of 188 , 269 , `` returns as many members to the House as the counties of York , Rutland , and Middlesex , '' which by the same census , contains 1,693,377 .
