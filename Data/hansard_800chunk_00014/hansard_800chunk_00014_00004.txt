night do our duty , if we do not give a decided pledge to the country , that a rigorous and effectual inquiry shall be instituted , and the explicit declaration of this pledge is the object of the Amendment which it is my intention to move . I do not mean to condemn the conduct of the officers employed by ministers in their ill-planned expeditions ; I am disposed to believe that the officers have done their duty , and that all the disastrous results are to be attributed to the want of information , the criminal improvidence , and the ill-digested plans of his Majesty 's ministers . Let not our attention be drawn off from the misconduct of ministers by any unwarrantable attempt of theirs to throw blame from themselves upon the officers employed . Your lordships must all remember the manner in which the blame of our former failure in Spain was attempted to be thrown upon that gallant officer , sir John Moore . It was insinuated on that occasion , that he had an unlimited discretion , and therefore that whatever occurred must be attributed to the measures which he chose to adopt . But , my lords , how did the real state of the case turn out ? It was discovered in the sequel that , so far from having an unlimited discretion , sir John Moore was fettered in the first instance by the plan of the Secretary of State ; that that plan was essentially contrary to the dictates of his own better judgment ; that he was sent to the north of Spain when in his own judgment he ought to have been sent to the south ; and that when there he was to receive directions from a diplomatic character of whom I wish to say nothing now ; but by these directions and instructions sir John Moore was completely fettered , and so far from having an unlimited discretion , he was prevented from exercising his discretion or his judgment under those very difficult circumstances where they might have been eminently useful . The work published by a near relation of that excellent officer , proves clearly and demonstrably the manner in which be was treated by ministers . Yet these very ministers are they , who 12 attempted to throw all that blame upon sir John Moore , which , upon the fullest investigation , was found entirely to rest with themselves . Your lordships ought not , therefore , to countenance any public outcry against the officers employed in those expeditions , of the disastrous results of which , loud and general complaints are so justly made ; but to point public indignation where alone it ought to rest , upon the heads of those ministers who sent out expeditions , either to achieve objects impracticable in themselves , or without the means of achieving any object useful or honourable to the country . If any circumstance should arise out of the inquiry during its progress tending to impeach the conduct of any officer employed , that will be a subject for future investigation ; but there are circumstances affecting the conduct of ministers , which are matters of publicity and notoriety , and which no inquiry can render plainer or clearer than they are at present . It is a notorious fact , a fact known to every one , to the whole country , and to all Europe , not that our expeditions have partially succeeded ; but , that the expeditions in the prosecution of which so much of the treasure of the country and so many valuable lives have been sacrificed , have uniformly failed , that they present nothing but an unbroken series of disgraceful , irremediable , and irretrievable failures . Who , then , can doubt the necessity , the absolute , the imperious , the indispensible necessity of inquiry , when nothing but disgraceful and irretrievable failures have marked the conduct of ministers , and resulted from their ill advised and ill-digested plans ; when nothing in the melancholy retrospect presents itself to our view , but
