already under cultivation , but if we extend our view to her waste lands , not like the waste lands of this country , of difficult or doubtful reclamation , but presenting not merely a capability but an aptitude peculiar for the production of those very articles of which you have the greatest necessity , a far more extensive prospect opens on us . A commission was most wisely appointed last year to enquire into this subject , and as the real extent of the productive powers of Ireland appears to be the true point on which the question before us to be determined , it may not be improper that I should now inform the Committee that I have already seen enough of the execution of that commission to have formed a confident expectation , first , that less than one sixth of the despised bogs of Ireland is not only capable , but peculiarly calculated for the production of the 38,500 tons of hemp , the staple of your navy , and for which in the last year the accounts are made up , you paid above 1,900,000l . to foreign nations : secondly , that somewhat more than another sixth would supply the 168,000 hogsheads of flax-seed , and the 20,000 tons of flax , and the articles of flaxen produce , for Which in the same time you paid above 2,600,000l . to other countries ; so that one third part of the wastes of Ireland would at once give you all the hemp and all the flax for which you are at present at the mercy of foreigners ; and give 4 millions and a half in each year to the industry of Ireland , at present applied to reward the labours of our enemies . The remaining two thirds of these lands , if they should prove to be applicable to the production of corn , would produce three-fold of all that quantity which we spared to you last year ; or if they should prove capable only of being converted into pasturage , still the effect would be the same , by setting free for the production of corn an equal quantity of the rich lands of the south at present occupied by cattle . With such prospects before us , and such means within ourselves , I can not express how I deplore that unsteady policy with which we appear to me to look round the world as it were and to put our trust in smugglers and in pirates , to purchase or to filch for us , from doubtful friends or declared enemies , the sinews of our strength and the means of our existence . For instance , consider the hemp which I have alluded to , for that we long depended upon Russia ; when 548 we lost her good graces , we turned next to the smugglers of the Adriatic , and now that their hemp , bad in its quality , is further become precarious in its supply , we are to look , I understand , for this staple of our navy to fields at a distance of 13,000 miles , to reward the industry of Indian ? labours , and to be guarded by the allegiance of an Indian army . In the same manner where have we not looked for flax , the favourite production of the * Irish soil ? How much cheese and butter are we indebted for to Holland ? it has been stated , I believe truly , to the amount of millions within these few last years.—And finally , what I must consider as the climax of impolicy , are we not at this moment importing corn from France ; yielding a direct revenue to Buonaparté on its export so long as he shall chuse to supply it , but crowning him with a rod of scorpions to be used against us , whenever real necessities may tempt him to with hold it.—Sir , I say instead of this system , or this want of system , look to Ireland , make her your granary and your storehouse
