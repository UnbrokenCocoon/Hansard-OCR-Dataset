Admiralty board , and five days after were returned to his Majesty for the purpose of having the recommendations they contained carried into execution . These six voluminous Reports therefore had passed the council and the Admiralty board , without much consideration . He supposed , from this haste , that the board did not intend to revise them . The subordinate boards , with the diligence which , he knew , characterized them , were now acting upon them , certainly contrary to the intentions of the commissioners themselves , because the Reports could only be considered as experimental . If there were a difference between the two modes of accounting recommended , and one mode were preferable to the other , let it be seen whether there was any thing so different in the construction of the two offices which prevented the application of similar principles.â€”The revision of which he was desirous , and which was so necessary , could not be left either to the Admiralty or Navy boards ; not from their want of ability for that purpose ; but for reasons stated in the very patent that established the commission ; `` that it was impossible , during the war , and with the pressing daily and hourly duties of those boards , for them to undertake such laborious investigations . '' No money could have been better laid out for the public service , than a few thousand pounds to provide for the continuance of the commission , till the commissioners should have revised their former reports . He had reason now to lament that the period most convenient for this revision had passed without affording an opportunity to the commissioners , for again revising 360 the reports which they had made on this most interesting subject . With respect to the commissioners , some alteration had taken place since their appointment ; for instance , the advanced period of life of one , lord Barham , had rendered it necessary he should retire from the labour of official business , and another ( Mr. Fordyce ) whose ability , integrity and capacity for business were exemplary , had died within the period assigned to the discharge of their duty . He complimented highly the talents of the several commissioners , and it was also to be recollected how important and arduous a duty attached itself to the revision of naval affairs . They were bound to extend their researches to a period as far distant as that when the duke of York presided at the head of the Admiralty in the reign of Charles the second . Lord Barham was much advanced in years , and might not be inclined to re-engage in such labours : but sir Roger Curtis , Mr. Serle , and admiral Domett remained , though even they might be fully employed in other services . If lord Barham were willing to resume his labours , and the commission could be revived , he should be glad . At the same time , he trusted ministers would not conceive he was calling upon them to institute another commission of naval revision . He knew too well the inconveniences which would result from the institution of a second commission . His only object in addressing their lordships upon this important subject was to direct their lordships attention to the importance of those Reports upon the table . The noble viscount concluded by moving `` That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty , requesting that he will be pleased to inform the House what steps had been taken conformably to the Report of the Commissioners for Naval Inquiry ; and whether it was the intention of his Majesty 's ministers to act on the recommendation of that Report . '' was not fully prepared to make that reply which perhaps would be most consistent with the motion of the noble viscount . With regard to the propriety of many of his observations , no one would question their real importance . But no one more than the noble viscount ought to be convinced , from experience , that considerable
