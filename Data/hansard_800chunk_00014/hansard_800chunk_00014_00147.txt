It is incumbent on me that I should submit to this House the reasons on which I found the motion of which I have given notice , for the Minutes of the Court Martial , held on lord Gambier . It is a document which his Majesty 's ministers on a former night , did not seem inclined to grant , although absolutely necessary , in order that every member may be enabled , fairly and impartially , to decide , whether the thanks , now in the contemplation of his Majesty 's ministers , are due to lord Gambier , for the part he took , in what has been denominated , by them , a victory in Basque roads . But , as if it were unnecessary that we should judge for ourselves , it has been asserted , by the right hon . the Chancellor of the Exchequer , that the merits of this case have been already decided on : that the Court Martial held on the noble lord , has already proclaimed his honourable acquittal ; and displayed the zeal , ability , and anxiety he manifested for the welfare of his Majesty 's service . But even were all this true , Sir , and were it possible that all those facts could be ascertained , by the mere inspection of the copy of a sentence , still I contend , that the combination would not entitle an officer to the thanks of this House—the proudest honour that is in our power to bestow . We have , Sir , a right , and ought to judge for ourselves ; and this we can only do , by carefully examining the Minutes of the Court Martial , before which the noble lord was tried on a very serious charge : a charge not brought against him by an individual , but by the lords commissioners of the admiralty , and grounded on official documents . Upon such documents , Sir , their lordships founded the charge `` of neglect , or delay in `` taking effectual means to destroy the `` enemy ; '' and we can not suppose that their lordships brought it without due consideration . However this may be , I submit to the House , that zeal , ability , and anxiety for the welfare of his Majesty 's service , and having done nothing wrong , do not entitle any officer to our thanks , which , if bestowed on trifling , or indeed any occasion , except when marked by brilliant achievement , will dwindle into utter contempt , even with those on whom they should be conferred . They are already held lightly in the estimation of the navy , and such I freely confess is my feel- 221 ing respecting them . I therefore intreat this House to weigh the matter well before they come to a decision , and to consider what they are about , and the consequences of voting indiscriminately and blindfolded , that which was formerly bestowed exclusively on those , who were publicly known to have rendered the highest services to the state . The House ought to be on their guard against giving way to motions , that have such objects ; as by these means , ministers might screen themselves from reprobation ; and gain for a man , whose parliamentary influence they required , the highest honours they could render , however unworthy the object.—I contend that to give the thanks of the House to an officer who has been tried on heavy charges , who , instead of going into action , continued at a distance not less than seven miles during the whole time , would be doing that for which no precedent could be found . I am clearly of opinion , that the Minutes of the Court Martial , which I am about to move for , are indispensably requisite ; not with a view to re-consider the decision of the court ; but to give foundation to our opinion respecting a matter on which we are not only entitled , but bound to
