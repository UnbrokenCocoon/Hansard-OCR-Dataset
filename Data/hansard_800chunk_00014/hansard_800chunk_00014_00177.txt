opinion , that the names of the Committee should be the same as last session , unless some reason could be assigned for removing any of them . But his hon . friend appeared to wish to have the Committee all his own way . This was not a political or a party question . As persons on the same side may differ as to the means of carrying a common object into effect , he could see no inconvenience that would arise from appointing persons of different opinions upon the Committee . , in explanation , staled , that he had never arrogated to himself the right of dictating to the committee ; nor thought of nominating those only who would agree with him , upon it . It was impossible for any gentleman to look at the list he proposed , and assert , that the gentlemen upon it were persons who would submit to receive his dictation . was of opinion that the Committee had not hitherto done its duty , in not bringing forward a measure for the abolition of the three sinecure places which they had already brought forward . He hoped they would yet do their duly , and that every honest man of every party would support him in the general motion on this subject , which he should , have to bring forward in a few days . He thought the best mode of adjusting the list would be , for the honourable mover and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take man and man each . freed the hon . gent . from any idea of wishing to controul the Committee while he was chairman of it .

Bourne . said , fortunately there was no man for whom he had a more sincere friendship than for the gentleman now named . It could not be supposed , therefore , that he opposed his name standing on the list for any other reason than because he was not one of the last committee.â€”He proposed that instead of the name of Mr. S. Bourne , there be inserted the name of Mr. Hawkins Brown . The House divided on the question , that Mr. Sturges Bourne be one of the Committee . Ayes 107 ; Noes 98 ; Majority 9 . Strangers were not again admitted into the gallery , but two further divisions took place which were understood to have been as follows : Mr. Bankes proposed Mr. Cavendish . The Chancellor of the Exchequer moved as an amendment , that the name of Mr. Leycester be substituted instead of that or Mr. Cavendish . The House divided on the question , that Mr. Cavendish be one of the Committee . Ayes 108 ; Noes 103 ; Majority 5 .
