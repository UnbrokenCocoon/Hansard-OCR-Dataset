and that yet such is the grievous operation of those penal laws of which the petitioners complain , that the Roman Catholics are thereby not only set apart from their fellow sub- 639 jects as aliens in this their native land , but are ignominiously and rigorously proscribed from almost all situations of public trust , honour , or emolument , including every public function and department , from the Houses of Legislature down to the most petty corporations : and they state that , whenever the labour of public duty is to be exacted and enforced , the Catholic is sought out and selected ; where honours or rewards are to be dispensed , he is neglected and contemned ; where the military and naval strength of the empire is to be recruited , the Catholics are eagerly solicited , nay compelled , to bear at least their full share in the perils of warfare , and in the lowest ranks ; but , when preferment and promotion ( the dear and legitimate prize of successful valour ) are to be distributed as rewards of merit , no laurels are destined to grace a Catholic brow , or fit the wearer for command ; and the petitioners state thus generally the grievous condition of the Roman Catholics of Ireland , occasioned solely by the fatal influence and operation of those penal laws , and though they forbear to enter into greater detail , yet they do not the less trust to the influence of reason and justice ( which eventually must prevail ) for effecting a full and deliberate enquiry into their grievances , and accomplishing their effectual relief ; and they do beg leave , however , most solemnly to press upon the attention of the House the imminent public dangers which necessarily result from so inverted an order of things , and so vicious and unnatural a system of legislation ; a system which has long been the reproach of this nation , and is unparalleled throughout modern christendom ; and they state it as their fixed opinion , that , to restore to the Catholics of Ireland a full equal and unqualified participation of the benefits of the laws and constitution of England , and to withdraw all the privations , restrictions , and vexatious distinctions , which oppress , injure and afflict them in their country , is now become a measure not merely expedient , but absolutely necessary ; not only a debt of right due to a complaining people , but perhaps the last remaining resource of this empire , in the preservation of which they take so deep an interest ; and therefore praying the House to take into their most serious consideration , the nature , extent , and operation of the aforesaid penal laws , and , by repealing the same altogether , to restore to the Roman Catholics 640 of Ireland those liberties so long withheld , and their due share in that constitution , which they , in common with their fellow subjects of every other description , contribute , by taxes , arms , and industry , to sustain and defend . '' A Petition of the Roman Catholic freeholders and inhabitants of the Queen 's County , was presented to the House by Mr. Parnell ; containing the same allegations and prayer as the last preceding Petition . A Petition of the Roman Catholics of the county and city of Cork , whose names are thereunto subscribed , on behalf of themselves and others , his Majesty 's subjects professing the Roman Catholic religion in Ireland , was likewise presented to the House by Mr. Hutchinson and read ; setting forth , `` That the Roman Catholics of Ireland , amounting to four millions at least of his Majesty 's subjects , constituting a vast majority of the population of that part of the United Kingdom , and contributing largely and liberally to increase the revenues and to recruit the fleets and armies of the empire , have long suffered and do still suffer from the restraint of laws humiliating in their provisions and most injurious
