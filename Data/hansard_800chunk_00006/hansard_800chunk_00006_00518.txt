, we are treated exactly as a mountebank treats his audience . He pathetically describes every disorder to which the human frame is sub–ject , he touches some spring of sympathy in every one of his hearers , and then offers them his pill , neatly boxed and labelled— '' Can you bear to hear of your pains and your sufferings , and not wish to ease them ? Here is your cure ; take it upon my credit , do n't examine into its composition , or en–quire into its operation . You have my word for it , it is safe and easy of digestion , and infallible in its effects . '' And yet , sir , you would not think that man imprudent , who , before he swallowed the pill , should open and analyze its contents.—The noble lord ( Howick ) might have spared himself the proof of the small comparative value of the African part of the trade ; it has been reduced by successive acts of parliament into the mere means of necessary supply to the population of out old colonies ; and , had not those colonies seen abolition sus–pended over their heads , their supply would have been much smaller than the average of late years shews it to have been . There is , in fact , sir , no encouragement to the extension of cultivation in the colonies , under the expence of purchasing negroes for that purpose ; and a hasty and some–what improvident importation and purchase 985 of negroes has been here and there occa–sioned by the dread of immediate abolition . I do not believe , that were you to remove that dread , our old colonies would require annually more than 7000 imported slaves : and looking to this limited trade as necessary for the welfare of the colonies , and for the advantage of a population of about 600,000 slaves , already existing there ; looking to it as subject to wise and humane regulations , belonging to the British trade alone , and which I think , sir , should not have been opposed ( those who opposed them , however , were jealous of an interfe–rence , the extent and full purport of which they could not foresee ) ; looking also , sir , ( and this is material , ) to what is and has been the state of society in Africa , and the practice there , I can not think that this rem–nant of the trade , thus existing , and for these purposes , calls upon us for its aboli–tion.—Sir , there has been a great and very prevalent misrepresentation of what was the state of Africa previous to the colonial demand for slaves . I have seen publications coming from respectable quarters , and extensively circulated by the abolitionists , which in positive terms assert , that , before the Europeans began to take slaves from the coast , Africa enjoyed internal tranquillity , and that its wars and its mi–series , as we find them existing at this day , are all imputable to the European slave-trade . There is a pamphlet which has the respectable name of a noble lord * ( Muncaster ) , a member of this house , affixed to it , which , adverting to the account given by Leo Africanus ( who wrote about the middle of the 15th century ) of the negro nations , states , upon his authority , that the Africans never made war ; and his lordship adds , that `` this full and positive declaration of the most intelligent historian of Africa , clearly proves that the whole of the slave trade now carried on by the Europeans bar been alone the work , has been entirely brought about by the maritime nations of Europe . '' To the same purport his lordship reports— '' That the amazing numbers which the Europeans are said to have purchased , but which they have unquestionably Carried out of this unhappy country , have been clearly from a trade created , not diverted .
