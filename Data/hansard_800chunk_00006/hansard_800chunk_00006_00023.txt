observe , with sincere pleasure , that , in the midst of the disastrous events which have followed , and under the most trying circumstances , the good faith of his majesty 's allies has remained unshaken ; that the conduct of the king of Sweden has been distinguished by the most honourable firmness ; and that the happiest union continues to subsist between his majesty and the emperor of Russia : —That we trust these reciprocal proofs of good faith will have the happy effect of strengthening and confirming an alliance which affords the best remaining hope of safety for the continent of Europe : —That , whilst we acknowledge , with gratitude , the gracious expressions of concern with which his majesty observes the necessity of adding to the public burthens , and sincerely partake in the same sentiment , we humbly beg leave to assure his majesty , that we will , upon 41 all occasions , carefully keep in view the Wishes which his majesty 's paternal goodness has induced his majesty to express , of combining all practicable economy with those efforts which it is necessary to make against the formidable and increasing power of the enemy : —That we are impressed with the deepest sorrow at the long series of misfortune which has afflicted the continent of Europe , and which could not fail to affect in some degree , many important interests of this country ; but that we observe , with the truest pleasure , that the great sources of our national prosperity have remained unimpaired : —That we feel the utmost confidence , that , under every difficulty , his majesty will still have the satisfaction of witnessing an increasing energy and firmness on the part of his people ; and that the valour and discipline of his majesty 's fleets and armies will continue to be displayed with the same Undiminished lustre which has distinguished them during the whole of the present contest : —That , with these advantages , and with an humble but firm reliance on the protection and support of Divine Providence , we are prepared to meet all the exigencies of the present crisis , and to second , to the utmost of our power , the paternal efforts of his majesty , to secure the honour and independence of the British crown , and the prosperity and freedom of his brave and affectionate people . '' in rising to second the address , observed that , in the present crisis , and at a period so big with new and extraordinary events , the satisfaction which his majesty was pleased to express at meeting his parliament , must be equally felt by every member of that house ; for there never was a moment when the collective wisdom of parliament was more imperiously called for , than in the present unexampled state of public affairs : and he was persuaded that the deliberations of that house would be so conducted as to merit the confidence which his majesty had been graciously pleased to repose in them . The house must see with concern that his majesty 's recent endeavours to restore peace to his subjects , had been disappointed by the failure of the late negociation ; and they must recognize in this proceeding of his majesty , the same benevolent disposition which had so often led his majesty in circumstances equally discouraging , to leave no means untried to put an end to the calamities of war.—His majesty having 42 ordered the papers relative to the late negociation to be laid before the house , it would be premature to enter into the discussion of the subject . They would , in course , have an early opportunity of doing so . But from the state of that transaction , published by the enemy , false and mutilated as it had been , he thought he might venture to pronounce , that the good faith , sincerity , and plain dealing of those noble persons to whom his majesty entrusted the conduct of the negociation , were no less conspicuous than the insincerity ,
