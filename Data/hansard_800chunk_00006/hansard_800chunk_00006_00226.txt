Speaker desired to be informed , whether the prayer of the petition involved any application for a grant of public money ? Mr. Thornton replied , that it might be taken to have that effect , as the expences which the company had heretofore been enabled to defray by annual grants from parliament , would hereafter be to be defrayed by the government . The speaker then observed , that in any case of a direct application for public money , the house could not receive from any individual a petition , without the consent of the crown ; though , where the interests of his majesty were only indirectly concerned , such consent might be signified in any stage of the measure , which was to be founded on the petition . The house was therefore not precluded from receiving this petition . The petition was then brought up , and referred to a select committee.â€”Mr . Jacob observed , that an account had been moved for , and ordered on a former day , of the number of ships engaged and registered , in the British trade , and stated his desire to move for another paper , that would be supplemental to that , and was necessary in order to put the house in possession of the whole subject . The paper he proposed to move for , was , an Account of the number of British ships that had been captured by the enemy , and without being re-captured , had been admitted again to British Register . The practice was , to have such vessels taken into the enemy 's ports , where they were sold to neutrals , and afterwards were allowed to be replaced on the British Register . This practice he contended amounted to a premium to the enemy for the capture of British vessels , as the neutral would not give half the price for the ships if he had not the power of placing them again on the British Register Lord H.

That noble lord , in his answer to a question from a learned gent . ( Mr. Perceval ) on a former night , stated , that his majesty 's ministers had , in the treaty which they had concluded with America , reserved to themselves the right of protecting the trade of this country against the measures of the enemy . If he understood the noble lord 's answer right , it amounted to this , that his majesty 's ministers had reserved the right to act for the protection of British trade , by the adoption of such measures towards neutrals , as they should submit to at the hands of France . If he was correct in his interpretation of his lordship 's answer , he wished to be informed whether , in the event of its being necessary to adopt more vigorous measures than were authorized by his Majesty 's proclamation , there was any thing in the late treaty with America , which would prevent his majesty 's ministers from resorting to such measures ? He was induced to ask this question because of the opposition that had been stated to the learned gent . for the production of a copy of his majesty 's proclamation . Besides , it would be desirable for the house to be informed upon this head , previous to the debate that was to take place on the learned gent . 's motion , and it was
