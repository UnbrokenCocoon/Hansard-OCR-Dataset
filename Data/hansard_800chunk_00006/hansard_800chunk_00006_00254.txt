and have told the committee that they had promised 40,000 men . Why did not they advance a few steps onward ? Here again they conducted themselves with prudence ; they knew the fact would be contrasted with the promise , and that the disproportion between 15 or 16,000 , and 40,000 men , would be too considerable . Attending , then , to this inequality between the assurances given and the event , he could entertain no very sanguine hopes of what these gentlemen would have done , had they the most favourable opportunity both of multiplying their promises and their exertions . The noble lord had dwelt much in complimentary observations on one of the administrations of which he was a member . Certainly , it did make considerable additions to the effective force ; and its measures had a much more beneficial operation than he ( lord H ) had expected . Thus much it 507 was fair to state . What was the result ? It would be seen by the accounts , that in January 1803 , about 95 or 96,000 men was the amount of the public force . On the 1st of July , 1804 , it consisted of 230,759 men , and 6,000 artillery ; constituting an augmentation of 140,000 men . No doubt could be entertained that the army of reserve act , as well as the regulations of the militia , were calculated to raise a large additional force ; the objections were that the means were oppressive , and that the effect was not permanent . When the army of reserve act was put in activity , he ( lord Howick ) was in the country , and he had that experience of its operation which led him to wish that the experiment would never be again tried unless in circumstances of the most pressing necessity ; yet he would not say , that the occasion on which resort had been had to the measure , was of sufficient urgency to justify its application . Thus , then , were added 140,000 men to the national force for limited service . The noble lord , emboldened by this success , became a little incautious , and asked , what was done in the next administration ? To which ( fond always of having `` Two Strings to his Bow '' ) he also belonged . At that time 33,000 men were added to the army . In this confident appeal , it would have been satisfactory if the noble lord had been able to shew , that this accession was derived from the politic measures of his administration . The first step was to abandon the project of the supplementary militia ; and the whole increase was to be attributed to five sources of supply : 1 . The militia . 2 . The army of reserve act . 3 . Raising for rank . 4 . The admission of boys into the army . 5 . The foreign corps . The last was principally derived from the German legion ; however the foreigners amounted to 8000 , and 13000 volunteered from the militia . In July 1804 , the increase was 140,000 , and the total force 245,090 . On Jan. 18 , it was 258,000 , and the increase only 29,172 . The militia was then reduced 16,000 , leaving the augmentation of the regulars and artillery at 13,185 men . To these add 8000 for the accession between the 1st of January and the 6th of March , and the increase would be 21,000 . But the fair comparison was not to be made in this way : it should be confined to the native regular army , exclusive of the artillery , and comprising troops both for limited and unlimited 508 service . In July 1804 , they were 122,691 ; in March following , 142,700 being an excess of 20,000 , of which 6600 were cavalry and 13,400 infantry . Taking , then , the final result of the measures of the last administration , the whole number raised was 5222 , of which
