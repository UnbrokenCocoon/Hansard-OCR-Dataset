millions by Loan , on an appropriation of ten per cent . and 1,200,000l . at 6 per cent . He wished to compare the effect of this with the effect of an operation of the same amount under the old system . The ultimate result would be , under the new system , a charge of 60,144,000l . before the period of extinction , while under the old system , the charge would be only 30,960,000l . Thus there would be a loss to public of 29,184,000l . This manner of comparative consideration would prove the difference of the advantages with which the war could be carried on , on the old plan or on the new ; and those points of comparison which he was about to submit were the only points he could discover . The complicated and extended scale of the noble lord could not be well comprehended without looking at its ultimate results . It would , therefore , be necessary to consider , first , the relative amount of the capital borrowed according to the new system and the 730 old ; 2dly , the relative amount of the public debt , and the effect of the operations of the old and the new plan upon it ; 3dly , the relative qualities of both systems with respect to the charges they would create in a period of 20 years ; 4thly , the relative facility with which they would admit of mitigations of the present burthens ; and 5thly , what relative state they would leave the finances in at the conclusion of their operations . By a comparison of the quantity of capital to be borrowed , the noble lord would feel how he would be best enabled to provide for a war expenditure of 32,000,000l . and if it could be shewn that by any means a loan of 11,000,000l . could be raised , without materially adding to our present burthens , which loan , in addition to 21,000,000l . of war taxes , would make the desired sum of 32,000,000l . the advantages of such a plan would be obvious , He would compare the amount of capital borrowed , at this rate , of eleven millions annually , with the amount of capital , at the same time under the noble lord 's plan . At the rate of 11,000,000l . annually , only 210,000,000l . would be borrowed on the whole period of 20 years , without any of the embarrassing machinery of the noble lord 's plan . According to the noble lord 's plan , there would be raised in the same period by war-loans 210,000,000l . ; and in Supplementary Loans , 204,200,000l . making a total of 416,200,000l . There was thus an excess of capital , by the operation of the new plan , of no less amount than 190,200,000l . exclusive of 82,000,000l borrowed on the war taxes , and redeemed within the period . Certainly it was not a matter of indefinite importance and policy , whether such an immense sum should be raised beyond what would be necessary under accustomed and more simple arrangements , while the whole of the war-taxes would be absorbed at the end of 14 years , and the whole 32 millions would be to be raised without any aid from them . There was little room to doubt that a necessity for going into the market for a loan of such vast amount would in a few years have as great an effect destroying credit and capital as that anticipated by the noble lord from the unlimited operations of the Sinking Fund , and the extinction of the whole public debt . Thus the new plan was injurious , not only in respect to the great accumulation of capital borrowed , but also in respect to the vast change it was calcu- 731 lated to make in the market . Another point of comparison was the state of both plans at the end of 20 years ; and also the comparative state of the Sinking Fund ; for he was ready to allow that
