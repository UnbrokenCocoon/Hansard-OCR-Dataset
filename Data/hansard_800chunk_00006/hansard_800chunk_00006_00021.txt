opportunity of recruiting their strength , with a view to future exertions for self-liberation from the oppression under which they groaned . But it was soon discovered that if any peace consistent with the honour of this country could be made , France would soon find it her interest to break it , or at least to indulge in farther aggrandizements , which must eventually lead to its rupture . His majesty 's ministers , therefore , having , in the first place , so far relied on the good sense of the people of this country , that they would not allow themselves to be buoyed up by false hopes , made the attempt at pacification ; but finding that those terms alone on which a peace ought to be concluded , could not be obtained , they preferred war , with all its calamities and burthens , to a peace which , by the abandonment of our allies , must eventually prove more destructive to the country than successive years of active warfare . This attempt , however , sufficiently shewed the pacific disposition 38 of Great Britain , and the restlessness and inquietude of France . His majesty had been graciously pleased to order the papers relative to the negociation to be laid on the table of the house . It would therefore be premature to enter into any minute discussion of the subject , but assuredly , enough had appeared in the partial statement of the enemy to prove the equivocation , the insincerity , and the subtlety to which they had the meanness to resort , and the true wisdom , the ability , and the plain manly good sense , by which that equivocation , that insincerity , and that subtlety were combated . Enough had been discovered to make the house confident , that when the whole of the transaction was fairly on the table , it would indubitably appear that the best means had been taken for security against the further aggrandisement of the enemy ; that nothing had been abandoned which ought to have been retained ; that the interests , neither of the continent , nor of our own country , had been endangered ; and that not a particle of honour had been compromised . On this high ground , having made every reasonable concession for peace , yet at the same time , maintaining the dignity of Great Britain unimpaired , ministers had a right to claim their most honourable reward , the support of that house and the approbation of their country . The failure of the negociation had , it was too well known , produced a series of most disastrous events , succeeding each other with unexampled rapidity . In the present state of circumstances , it was unnecessary , perhaps it might be ungenerous , to comment on the conduct of Prussia , which had led to that state ; but at least , it was some Satisfaction to know , that however desirous the British government might be to afford every assistance to the king of Prussia , they were in no degree responsible for the proceedings at the commencement of the Prussian war , or for the manner in which that war was carried on . If our eyes were directed to another quarter , it would reasonably be permitted us to hope , that although Russia might not be able to reconquer kingdoms , and re-establish thrones ; she might yet have the power of setting a boundary to that inordinate ambition which had swallowed up every government within its reach . From the contemplation of foreign affairs , which he allowed was comparatively painful , he would turn to that which ever had afforded , which did afford , 39 and which he trusted , ever would afford , a most pleasing picture ; a picture , which the contrast rendered more pleasing : he meant the internal state of Great Britain . On the blessings which we enjoyed , it was unnecessary to expatiate ; they were justly understood , they were fully appreciated , they were warmly and
