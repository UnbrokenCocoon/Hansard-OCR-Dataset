sacrifice to risk one-third of the British exports , besides imports to a large amount , independent of the employment given to such a number of seamen , as were annually engaged in the trade with Africa . He wished not to delay the house , but he strenuously recommended a prolongation of the time when the bill should begin to operate , and a total change of the preamble of the bill . on rising for the first time to address the house , solicited the indulgence usually extended t young members , and declared , that a consciousness of his own inexperience in debate would have deterred him from delivering his sentiments on the present occasion , did not an imperious sense of duty , an irresistible impression of the magnitude and importance of the question to the best interests of the state , rise paramount to all other , considerations , and induce him to appeal to the sober and deliberate judgement of the house , against that strain of eloquent declamation which , on a former evening , had been so zealously and successfully employed to rouse the passions , to overpower and mislead the reason . He trusted that an humble individual might be permitted to raise his voice in defence of that system of our an- 1041 cestors under which our commercial prosperity had attained its present extent , and our naval strength its power . He was the more anxious to make this attempt , from observing that no one possessing personal knowledge , or local experience of the real condition of slavery in the West Indies , had yet offered any information to the house , and having spent a considerable part of his life in the most important of our colonies , and having therefore some knowledge of the subject , he would endeavour to convey juster ideas of the present state of negroes in these settlements than seemed now to prevail . Indeed , the representations which had been made , and descriptions given , were of that nature , that they had excited no small degree of astonishment in his mind ; so much so , that doubts might have arisen ( if these relations were deserving of credit ) whether all that he had heard or witnessed during a residence of 10 years in the West Indies , must not have passed in a dream ; and he would tell the hon , members , from his own personal observation , that there did not exist a more happy race than the slaves in our colonies , it any trust was to be placed in outward appearances , which universally indicated cheerfulness and contentment . If the statements which had been given were correct , if the enormities which had been related were practised , he had no difficulty in saying , that man must be destitute of the common attributes of humanity , who , believing such accounts , did not cordially join the advocates of the present measure in voting for the abolition of the trade ; nay , for the abolition of slavery itself . But he must totally deny the truth of these general accusations , and demand proof : neither could he admit , that one or two instances of severity or oppression , if established even , ( such circumstances must and do happen in every country , ) —could be admitted as evidence of the delinquency of the system at large ; and it was singular , that the most exalted characters , those heroes , the ornament and pride of their , country , and who had been employed in the colonies almost to a man , bore testimony to the milt and lenient treatment of slaves in the West Indies.—Here the hon . gent . lamented , that the legislature had thought fit to deny itself the benefit of all additional information , by evidence , on this important question , on the alledged ground that nothing new could be adduced . 1042 During the period which had elapsed since the enquiry on this subject was closed , he
