pangs with which his solitude must be tortured , and his repose banished , by the re–collection of the blood he had spilled , and the oppressions he had committed ; and when he compared with those pangs of remorse , the feelings which must accompa–ny his hon . friend ( Mr. Wilberforce ) from that house to his home , after the vote of that night should have confirmed the ob–ject of his humane and unceasing labours ; when he should retire into the bosom of his happy and delighted family , when he should lay himself down on his bed , reflecting on the innumerable , voices that would be raised in every quarter of the world to 979 bless him ; how much more pure and perfect felicity must he enjoy in the consciousness of having preserved so many Millions of his fellow-creatures , than the man with whom he had compared him , on the throne to which he had waded through slaughter and oppression and spoke in substance as follows : —I rise very reluctantly , sir , to trespass upon the house at this late hour , and immediately after a speech as impres–sively eloquent perhaps as any that was ever delivered within these walls ; but extensively connected as I am , and have long been , with the commerce of the West Indies , and having now for the first time a seat in this house , during any debate upon this question , it may be expected that I should not let it pass with merely a silent vote ; and I will hope too , that , al–though the subject has been so fully and so frequently canvassed within these walls , I may be pardoned , should I appear , thus Circumstanced , either to recur to what may have been amply discussed , or to question What may have been generally admitted in the course of former debates in this house .

I can not , however , but think it hard , Sir , that West-India proprietors and merchants , persons not destitute of talents and education , and certainly having the mean being well informed on this subject , are yet 980 in a manner banished from the court , while their interests and their properties are liti–gated : they are not allowed to be either judge , jury , witness , or party ; for they are told that they quite mistake their own inte–rests , and that others know much better than they do what is good for them . Now surely , sir , they should either be listened to as disinterested evidence , or their par–tial interest should be admitted as proof of the risk which their property is incurring ; and the public , so far as it
