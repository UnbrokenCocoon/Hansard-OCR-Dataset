may be necessary to make for our peace establishment although he mentions it . I allude 1st , to the assumption that each loan will be paid off in 14 years , by its accompanying Sinking Fund at 5 per cent . 2d . That the War Taxes will be sufficiently productive in peace to do what is required of them . 3d . That our War Expences will be kept so low as 38,000,000l . As to the first , the noble lord proceeds on an expectation that the 3 per cents will be stationary at 60l . without considering that the sums so raised may , and 806 in all probability will be paid off with the same stock at 80l . 90l . or at par . There can be no doubt but that the redemption of the debt is much more likely to be retarded by such rise , than it is to be accelerated by future loans being made at a lower rate of interest , in consequence of the increased value of the stock . These objections struck me very forcibly on the noble lord opening his plan , as I observed to a learned friend near me ; and on the best and most mature reflection I have since been able to bestow on the subject , I am strongly confirmed in them . I can not express myself too strongly respecting a continuance of the part of the War Taxes I have alluded to for an indefinite term , according as the price of stocks may be , under a firm and clear conviction founded on experience , that with the exception of those on goods and shipping , and on malt , ( to which I have objections of a different nature ) the taxes at their present rates would so lessen the lawful consumption of most of the articles on which they are levied , as to reduce the old duties on the same to at least as great an extent as the amount of the War Taxes ; if I am right in that , the revenue would of course profit nothing by a continuation of the latter , but would Probably sustain a loss . —Tea—the war duty on which produces nearly 2,000,000l . When Mr. Pitt came into office , the duties , according to the rate and to the value , were about 85l . per cent . on the value . The legal consumption was then 4,313,000 pounds on an average of ten years , which much exceeds former accompts . The duty was lowered in 1784 , to 12l . 10s . on the value , and gradually raised in Mr. Pitt 's time to 40l . per cent . on the higher priced teas , under which the consumption got up to an average in the ten years to 1806 , to about 20,000,000 lbs . : here then is an increase of more than 15,000,000 lbs . Supposing the average value of the tea sold by the Company to be 4s . a pound , the duty , which is now 95l . per cent . including the War Tax of 45l . on the present consumption , would be about 3,800,000l . ; if that very high amount should reduce the consumption in peace to any thing like what it was before the Commutation Act , it was evident the revenue would sustain a loss by a continuation of the War Tax . There are indeed other considerations respecting this duty , deeply affecting our manufactures and navigation , as well as the interests of the East India Company ; the Custom-house value 807 only of British manufactures exported to China from 1773 to 1784 , was 110,000l . which from 1785 to 1805 was on the average 680,000l . and on the average of the last five years more than 1,000,000l . And the shipping from China , which from 1774 to 1784 was only 5256 tons , increased to an average of 18,555 tons.—Of Tobacco I shall only observe that the war tax of 6d . a lb .
