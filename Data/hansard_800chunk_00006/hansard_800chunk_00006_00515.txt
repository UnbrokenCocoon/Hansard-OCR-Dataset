is concerned with them , ought to be aware of the extent of the sacrifice which it may be called upon to make.—Whatever concessions may have been made by those who have preceded me in the debate , I can not , sir , grant at the outset , that this bill is unquestionably grounded upon humanity and justice , and then debate it as a matter of expedi–ency and policy . There can be no dispute about the obligation of those great princi–ples—it is eternal and immutable as is their nature ; and if you admit that the present measure is their necessary dictate , the dispute is at an end . I can not stand here , and , in opposition to them , calculate the advantage of an increased production of sugar and coffee : but if I had been told , not of this measure now proposed to us , but of any measure that , although it was indisputably enjoined by every principle of justice and humanity , yet that in the course of almost 20 years discussion , it had not been able to make its effective progress through the British parliament ( recommen–ded , at the same time , by the cry of the people out of doors , and by an union of the greatest talents within ) , until it re–ceived the protecting hand of his majesty 's principal minister in either house , I should say , '' it is impossible ; there must be some mistake in the application of these great principles to the measure ; '' it is one of those perhaps which , grounding itself upon existing and acknowledged abuses , attempts to accomplish objects beyond the reach of legislation , assumes a standard of human perfection which experience does not jus–tify , and puts into hazard existing establishments , which , though imperfect , confer much public and much private benefit , with a promise of substituting what exists only in visionary theory . If so , the mea–sure must be the occasion of just jealousy to a wise legislature , as approaching , in feature and character , to those wild projects of reform , to which the spirit of modern philanthropy has given birth , and of which 981 the civilized world has lately seen the terrible results—projects , sir , that have universally proved subversive of their objects , and have collaterally caused a mass of misery and destruction , of which , to give even a faint and imperfect description , will puzzle the most eloquent of those who shall attempt to convey to posterity a record of the present times.—What is it , sir , that could have resisted a measure , which had been unquestionably built upon those great principles ? Is it the opposition of the West India body in parliament ? Alas , sir , who ever heard of them as combined into a political phalanx or squad , displaying , in this or in the other house , a compact and regular front in critical moments of the battle and , by judicious manœuvres and co-operations with other bodies , giving and receiving mutual assistance and support ? I will not say , whether , had they done so , they would have stood here now defenceless as they do ; but I have known the West-India body long , and never saw them thus arrayed and disciplined . In fact , they have felt their intimate connection with all the leading interests of the mother country ; they could trace all the profit of their labours into every channel where it might benefit the British capitalist , manufacturer , and landholder ; they have looked upon the merchant , the banker , the manu–facturer , the landholder , the soldier , and the seaman in this house as their represen–tatives , and they have experienced occasionally support from them all : more particularly must I declare , with heart-felt gra–titude , that in every rank of the British navy , the colonists have found friends . I believe , sir , I may say ,
