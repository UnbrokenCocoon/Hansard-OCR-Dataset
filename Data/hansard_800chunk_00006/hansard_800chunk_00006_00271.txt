, and that he wished to amend . And surely that wish which it appeared was in direct consonance with that which the right hon . gent . alleged to have been the practice , in a way that did not officially appear , could not be deemed any reproach either upon himself or his predecessors , by whom the right hon . gent . ascertained that wish was entertained and acted upon . disclaimed the suspicions imputed to him . The right hon . gent . was not among those whom he supposed capable of censuring the conduct of his right hon . friend . All he meant to say with respect to the accounts referred to , was this , that his late right hon . friend had been in the habit , for several years , of obtaining similar accounts from the office of the comptroller of the navy . declared that he had never seen such an account in the treasury , and maintained that such an account as that alluded to by his right hon . friend , was continually necessary , in order to enable ministers to make out correct esti–mates , and also to render to parliament a correct account of the public expenditure . took occasion to complain of the conduct of public officers in not leaving in their offices any official documents which might be communicated to them . He was sorry to say that this conduct was particularly remarkable in the office which he had the honour to occupy , as upon his accession to it he did not find a single paper relative to previous official proceedings , at least on this side of the channel . Papers which contained , any official information , and which were communicated for public purposes , ought , as appeared to him , to be in no case removed from the proper offices , as they belonged not to the persons who might occupy any particular office , but to the public . stated , that the paper he had was his own property , as it was a case for which he himself paid , and that the original ought to be in the treasury . asked where the original was , in what office , and what denomination ? did not know what particular place , as he was not keeper of the papers . The motion for the grant of 10,000 men was agreed to , as were the following mo–tions : 240,500l . for wages for ditto , for 13 months ; 247,000l . for victualling , & c. ; 390,000l . for wear and tear of ships ; 32,500l . for ordnance ; 1,135,434l . for the ordinaries of the navy ; 2,134,903l . for building ships in merchants ' yards , and other extra expences ; 1,500,000l . for the hire of transports ; 300,000l . for sick and wounded seamen ; 500,000l . for prisoners of war . moved the following sums for miscellaneous service : 6,853l . for the superintendance of aliens ; 12,000l . for defraying the expences of the public office in Bow Street ; 51,350l . for con–victs at home ; 15,000l . for contingencies in the offices of the three secretaries of state ; 12,000l . for messengers for the secretaries ' offices , & c. ; 175,000l . for foreign and secret service money ; 20,000l . for law charges ; 3,000l . for the expence of prosecuting those concerned in the forgery of coin , & c. ; 11,600l . for sheriffs of counties to defray the extra expence incur–red in the conviction of felons , & c. ; 140,199l . for the relief of French , Dutch , and Corsican emigrants , and also of American loyalists ; 1,432l . 13s . 6d . to pay the balance advanced for ditto in 1806 ; 1,336l . for the relief of poor dissenting ministers , and French refugees ; 1,828l . for the use of a certain class of ministers ; 1,934l . for stationery , & c. to the court a exchequer , & c. ; 5,210l
