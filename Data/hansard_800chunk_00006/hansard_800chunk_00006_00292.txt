He only wished to suggest , that the annuities which the noble lord mentioned as one of the means for carrying this measure into effect , had been already actually applied by law to the Sinking Fund . observed , that the right hon . gent . 's recollection failed him . It was true , that in 1786 they had been applied as he stated , but in 1802 they had been detached from this purpose . The debate would more properly take place after the Resolutions were printed ; and besides the Resolutions , there was a set of Tables illustrative of the different forms and modes in which the plan he had just detailed would operate , and of which , although they could not be regularly laid 598 on the table of the house , he would take care that every member should be provided with a copy . [ See Appendix to the present volume . ] Conscious as he was , that in the speech he had just had the honour of making to the house , many particulars had been omitted , and many things obscurely stated , he declared it would give him pleasure to afford every possible information to the house on the subject . although he allowed that it would be preferable to postpone the debate until after the Resolutions should be printed , yet thought one short observation necessary ; because , if the impression made by the speech of the noble lord were allowed to go abroad , the country might be induced to entertain an opinion which could never be realized . The noble lord had displayed great talents and great eloquence , and the display of those talents and that eloquence had been clearly evinced by his leading the house , at such a moment as the present , when the Income tax pressed so hard upon the necessities of the people , and when every alleviation of the burthens imposed by that tax had been so unprecedentedly and so steadily refused , to listen to a detail of the mischiefs which would arise from the payment of the national debt and from the relief from all their taxes . All the noble lord 's conclusions proceeded on the supposition that the annual expenditure of the country would not exceed 3S millions . Grant him that , and the rest followed . What had been the consequence of a similar hope held out at the beginning of the war , namely , that the war could be carried on without any increase of debt
