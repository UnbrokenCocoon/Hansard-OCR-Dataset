was a mark of mystery , and of the wishes of his majesty 's ministers to conceal and to suppress 634 the interesting intelligence therewith connected , he confessed himself totally mistaken in his understanding of the terms secrecy , mystery , and disguise . It was equally unfair to argue , that his majesty 's ministers in that house were averse to the production of the paper from an apprehension of an active and searching discussion , which as it was pretended , it might be prudent in them to decline ; for , if that were the case , they would not have persisted in that refusal , which more immediately involved them in the supposed difficulty , and gave his learned friend , upon the opposite side , the most plausible pretence upon which he could urge his present motionâ€”a pretence which had been dwelt upon with all his learned friend 's characteristic address , but which , at the same time , was certainly rather to be admired for its declamatory display , than assented to for its reasoning force . But leaving all further argument upon this part of the subject , he should now proceed to argue the merits of the case , as if the document required were really before the house : confident , as he was , that whenever it should be expedient to produce that document , the measure would not be found likely to produce those effects which his hon . and learned friend had been pleased to attribute to it . The conduct of the French government , in issuing the edict alluded to by his hon . and learned friend , was allowed on all hands to be in direct violation of the law of nations , and of the rights of neutral powers , with a view solely to destroy , if possible , the commerce of this country : or what were its tenour and purport ? Why , to declare , forsooth , all the ports of the British isles in a state of blockade ( although France was not able to send a single ship to the mouth of any one of them , to support the manifesto ) , and to announce her determination to capture and confiscate every neutral ship , with its cargo , that shall have touched at any of those ports , on its way to a continental port , or shall be found approaching thereto , until Great Britain shall have renounced the right of capturing the private ships of any nation with which she may be at war , and to confine the exercise of the right of capture merely to the ships and vessels belonging to the government of the belligerent nation . But this was a principle as novel in the usages of war between belligerent powers , as the edict itself was contrary to the law of nations . The 635 usage of capturing the commercial ships and cargoes of an enemy at war was , he contended , as old as war itself ; it was an usage asserted by every nation , and a right still more important than that of capturing an enemy 's ship of war ; because the commercial vessels of an enemy contributed so greatly to increase his revenues and resources for carrying on and protracting war ; and yet this was the sole ground of pretence upon which the French government proceeded to declare the ports of these islands in a state of blockade ! His hon . and learned friend did not venture to sustain the conduct of France on this occasion ; he was of opinion , that neutral nations had full right to retaliate ; and that those nations would allow the like right to this country , and of having recourse to similar means for distressing an enemy , who had so flagrantly outraged the law of nations . The question , then , to be considered was merely , to what extent it would be politic and advisable to exercise that right , without first giving due notice to those nations
