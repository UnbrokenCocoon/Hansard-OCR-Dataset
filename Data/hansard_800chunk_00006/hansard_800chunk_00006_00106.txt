or tamely submit to any base acknowledgement of inferiority to any enemy , however extensive his territorial influence , or splendid his military success . But , my lords , in entering into the discussion of the merits of the late negociation , anxious as I feel to express my approbation of the conduct of his majesty 's government in fully supporting the acknowledged character of this country for sincerity and good faith ; satisfied as I am with the manner in which the interests and safety of our allies have been preserved , as well of those powers to whom we were bound by the solemn com- 287 pact of the most sacred obligations , as of others , whose strong claim upon our assistance , arose equally from the benefit of the principle , and the congeniality of the interest ; yet , my lords , I may be permitted to say , without the least imputation upon the conduct or reputation of ministers , that I lament the protraction of the negociation . The prolongation of the correspondence I regret , because the chicanery and the deception of the French government were so peculiarly marked , and so apparently observable throughout every stage of the negociation . And , my lords , give me leave to say , that when , under the direct authority and express avowal of his majesty , such a negociation is thought necessary to be originated , no one act should be overlooked , or any circumstance omitted , calculated to lessen , either in the eyes of the enemy , or of Europe , the glory and honour of the crown , connected , as they are , with the greatness and security of the empire . Therefore , I should have pondered longer and longer , previous to my acquiescence in any procedure in which the manifest intention of the enemy of these realms was to delude by delay , to defeat by deception . For if , by any unfortunate and destructive infatuation , we should ever be brought to imitate the conduct of those countries , which , from narrow views of policy , and a confined , selfish , and fatal contemplation of events , have ultimately been made the victims of their own delusion , and annihilated by that very power to which they had so repeatedly succumbed ; if , I say , the people of Great Britain should ever be induced to forget the proud distinction of their own immediate situation , or neglect the sacred principle , by the exercise of which that proud distinction was obtained , then should we have to regret the complete forgetfulness of all that was hitherto held sacred ; to witness the lamentable submission of British honour and good faith , to the most scandalous violation of every principle of equity , and every precept of common justice . To guard against such an humiliation , and to preserve unsullied the unrivalled honour of the British name , there is not , I am convinced , an individual in this country , through whose veins one drop of British blood circulates , but would voluntarily shed it in that noblest of all causes , and who does not look forward with the most ardent feelings , to that great and important trial , upon the result of which his , own and his country 's happiness and 288 security will depend . But , my lords , though I fully appreciate the danger of the crisis , and the energies which such a danger demands to have brought into immediate action ; and though I strongly feel the necessity of supporting his majesty with firmness and vigour , yet , from my knowledge of the man who commands the resources of France , from my knowledge of his respect for no law , and my conviction of the unceasing ambition by which he is actuated , I can by no means bring myself to join in that part of the address , where the ineffectual endeavours of his majesty to terminate a pacific treaty with the chief
