extending to German Yarn the provisions of an act , made in the last session of the last parliament , for permitting Prussian yarn to be imported in foreign ships , on payment of the like duties as if imported in British ships , was read a second time , and committed to a committee of the whole house , for to-morrow . A Petition of Joseph Marryat , esq . agent for the island of Trinidad , was presented to the house , and read ; setting forth , `` That the petitioner observes , with inexpressible concern , that a bill is now depending before the house for the Abolition of the Slave Trade ; and that the operation of such a measure , if passed into a law , will inevitably ruin many British subjects , who have embarked their property in the island of Trinidad , confiding in the encouragement held out by his majesty 's ministers ; and that the whole of the sugar estates in the said island are in a state of infancy , all of them having been cleared and put into cultivation since the year 1784 , and many of them Since the year 1797 , when the island was surrendered to the British arms ; and that , in consequence of the encouragement held out to British subjects by his majesty 's ministers , purchases were made from the 830 Spaniards of those estates which had been settled under the cedula of Spain , at the very high prices of from 50l . to 60l . sterling per acre , and large sums of money have been expended in erecting works and buildings upon the different plantations , for the manufacturing of sugar and distillation of rum , upon an expectation that the planters would be able , as their capitals increased , to acquire by gradual purchases a sufficient number of negroes to cultivate their estates to advantage ; and that none of the estates in the island are as yet sufficiently stocked with negroes ; and , if this bill should pass into a law , the lands thus cleared and purchased , and the buildings thus erected , would become of little or no value , from the impossibility of cultivating the one , or making the intended use of the other ; and that the government of Spain has lately issued cedulas inviting settlers to the Spanish main , by the offer of liberal grants of land , an open trade with all nations , the free importation of slaves , and exemption from taxes and from duties on imports and exports for ten years , advantages which , from the facility of the communication between the adjacent Continent and Trinidad will , after the abolition of the Slave Trade , be powerful temptations to the inhabitants of that island to emigrate with their negroes to the opposite coast , and thus to depopulate a British settlement to aggrandize those of the enemy ; and therefore praying , on the part of his constituents , that the said bill may not pass into a law ; and that he may be heard by counsel at the bar of the house , and may be permitted to give evidence in support of the case of his constituents . '' A Petition of the planters , merchants , mortgagees , annuitants , and others , interested in the British West India colonies , whose names are thereunto subscribed , was presented to the house , and read ; setting forth , `` That the petitioners observe , with the deepest concern and alarm , that a Bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade has passed the house of lords , and is now depending before this house ; and that the trade to Africa for labourers has been , for a great number of years , sanctioned , approved , and encouraged by royal charters and proclamations , and by repeated acts of the British legislature , which declare , in the strongest terms , a most anxious desire to regulate , extend , secure , and
