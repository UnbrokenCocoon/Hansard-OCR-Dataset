recapitulate the Supplies and Ways and Means of the year . As an opportunity had already been afforded him , from the nature of the Plan of Finance , which , on a former occasion , he had opened to the house , of adverting in a detailed view to the extent of the supplies and ways and means of the year , he did not feel it then necessary for him to go at large into the statements he had formerly submitted to the house . But , as the loan had since been negociated , and as the time that had elapsed , enabled him to make the several statements with more accuracy than in the first instance he might have done , he hoped for the indulgence of the committee , whilst he shortly recapitulated the several branches of the supply and ways and means of the year ; after which he proposed to state the terms upon which the contract for the loan of the year had been concluded , and then to explain what part of the Ways and Means of the year would be permanent : SUPPLY .

It was proposed to make good the advance that had been made to the king of Prussia , of a sum of 80,000l . out of the vote of credit , and also to pay a subsidy of 230,000l . to the king of Sweden , in pursuance of existing treaties . An advance was also to be made to the emperor of Russia , of 500,000l . out of the vote of credit . These were all the subsidies that he was then aware of as necessary to be paid , and at all events he had no doubt that the vote of credit of 3,000,000l . would be sufficient to cover what might accrue in the present year . The apportionment of the Votes of Credit was , for Great Britain 2,800,000 For Ireland 200,000 Together £.3,000,000 The whole of the joint charges as he had stated , would be 45,396,575 To which was to be added Interest of Exchequer Bills 1,200,000 Loyalty Loan to be paid off 350,000 Deficiency of Malt Tax , 1805 200,000 Which made the Total Charge 47,046,575 Deduct 2–17ths for Ireland 5,545,677 Remains to be defrayed by Great Britain 41,500,898 He had next to state the Ways and Means by which these supplies were to be covered ; — Land and Malt £.2,750,000 Surplus of Consolidated Fund 3,500,000 War Taxes this year 19,800,000 Lottery 320,000 Vote of Credit 3,000,000 Loan 12,200,000 Surplus of Ways and Means , 1805 171,185 Making a Total of £.41,671,185 Excess over Supples 170,286 He had stated the Loan as a part of the Ways and Means of the year , and he had next to inform the committee of the terms upon which that loan had been contracted for ; a duty which he should perform with satisfaction , from the advantageous terms upon which it had been negociated .
