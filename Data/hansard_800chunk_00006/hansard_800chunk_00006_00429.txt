the last , and the positive injustice of that . The noble lord stated with 810 exultation that the permanent taxes , which were only 10,200,000l . in 1784 , had been increased to 32,000,000l . in 1806 ; it was natural for him to do so , and I am rejoiced he has discovered that the resources of the country are not in that dilapidated state , they were represented to be in when his . colleagues came into office : The merits , of my late right hon . friend in being the chief instrument to bring them up to that sum , will appear most conspicuous when it is adverted to , that the taxes were so judiciously selected as to admit of the manufactures , commerce , and navigation of the country , nearly keeping pace with the increase of our burthens , instead of being at all depressed by them . It will be sufficient to state that the value of the British manufactures exported from Great Britain in that year , ending January 1784 , was 10,409,000l . ; and in 1805 , was 25,004,000l . It was not however exclusively by the imposition of Taxes that Mr. Pitt improved the Revenue , but by a constant and watchful care : proposing the lowering and raising duties , as he thought advisable from time to time ; The Revenue 1781 , the first year of his Administration was10,194,000 Taxes of 1784 and 1785 were938,000 Cained by the Consolidation in 1787 , turning Fractions into Integers , Wood and Cambric85,000 Taxes imposed in 178960,000 11,277,000 And the Produce of the same Taxes in the year ending January 1803 , was15,433,000 Leaving a clear gain by improved management of4,156,000 Of which total , Spirits , Wine , Tobacco , and Post Horse duty , amounted to1,165,000 If I had no other reasons to offer against putting out of our power the war taxes , I should think I have said enough to induce the committee not to decide hastily in favour of a measure which can not be effected without our doing so ; but I wish further to press on their consideration , that any substitutes for those it may be found necessary should expire , will not be within our grasp . I allude to the necessity of looking to a provision for our peace establishment ; it is observed indeed in a paper circulated by ministers , `` how far some parts of the War Taxes are of a description to remain in force after the war ; and what may be the provision to be made hereafter for a peace establishment ; probably much larger than 811 in former periods of peace , are considerations which at present need not be anticipated ! ! '' Are we than to shut our eyes against a situation which ( however hopeless the present prospect is ) we may be in within a-year or two ? Are we now entirely to exclude from our deliberations the prudence of divesting ourselves of all power over taxes which we may want for our peace establishment , if we shall find by enforcing existing regulations and enacting new ones we can hereafter even continue any part of them ? However difficult it may be to ascertain the exact amount of that establishment , no one will doubt for a moment but that it must be infinitely larger than the former one . I will state one lower than I am sure his majesty 's ministers can entertain the remotest hope of its being reduced to , and opposite to it the means we have to provide for it .
