former years of war , of offering to his majesty our congratulations on any signal and decisive victory by sea , we nevertheless reflect , with just pride and acknowledgement , on the several distinguished instances in which the skill , valour , and intrepidity of British officers and seamen have been displayed in their usual lustre , and with their accustomed success , over equal or superior squadrons of the enemy . But we can not help lamenting , in justice to the naval service , as well as to the interests of the country , that supineness or mismanagement , by which the predatory squadrons of the enemy have been permitted to range , unchecked , among our West-India colonies , and to escape with impunity , and by which our commerce has been exposed , to a degree of annoyance highly injurious to the interests and discreditable to the maritime superiority , of Great Britain.—With equal sorrow , and with no less astonishment , we have observed those delays and uncertainties , and that apparent perplexity and fluctuation of councils , which have marked the conduct of the war department of the state , which have hitherto prevented the execution of those measures which ministers persuaded the late parliament to enact , and upon which they themselves professed so greatly to rely for the internal defence of the empire ; and delays which have so long confined our expeditions within our own ports , and have rendered the military preparations of this government at once in- 58 effectual to the annoyance of the enemy , and a just ground of dissatisfaction and disappointment to the nation at large.—We rejoice in the opportunity of congratulating his majesty on the capture of that valuable and important settlement , the Cape of Good Hope , by those distinguished officers , sir D. Baird and sir H. Popham . We have however , the consolation and gratification of being able to recall his majesty 's attention to acquisitions and achievements in the course of the present year , by which , notwithstanding the apparent inactivity of his majesty 's present servants , the credit of his majesty 's arms , by sea and land , has been sustained in the different quarters of the globe . We congratulate his majesty on the signal advantages obtained by his majesty 's arms in the expedition under sir H. Popham , and general Beresford , against the Spanish settlement of Buenos Ayres ; advantages which , if seasonably supported and diligently improved , must be in the highest degree valuable to this country , opening fresh channels of commercial enterprise , and affording new and increasing encouragement to British manufactures and navigation ; advantages doubly important at a moment when the other markets of the world are attempted to be closed against us.—We enter , with heartfelt exultation , into the sentiments so justly expressed by his majesty , on the brilliant victory obtained on the plains of Maida , by his majesty 's land forces , under the gallant and able conduct of sir J. Stuart , over a French army , superior in numbers . We feel with his majesty , the full value of the seasonable check given , by this splendid achievement to the overweening confidence of the enemy ; and of the proof which it affords that the character and constitution of the British army were not inadequate , upon their ancient footing , to maintain , unimpaired , the lustre of the British name , and the military glory of our ancestors.—That we shall nevertheless examine , with due attention and solicitude , into the effect of that new system which the late parliament were induced to adopt , for improving the character , as well as augmenting the amount of his majesty 's regular forces ; willing to hope that we shall have the satisfaction of discovering an improvement so striking , and an augmentation so rapid and abundant , as at once to have supplied all the deficiencies arising from the disuse of such measures as have been either abolished or suspended , and to compensate
