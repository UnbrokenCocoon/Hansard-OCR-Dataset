of their creditors , whose fortunes have assisted in cultivating the plantations in the West Indies , and are now secured upon them , but also deeply injurious to the interests of the British empire at large , as all descriptions of property in this kingdom must suffer most severely by the effects of a plan that shall operate to destroy the great capital invested in the British West India colonies , and to cut off a commerce which pays annually in duties upwards of three millions to Great Britain , employs more than sixteen thousand seamen , contributes one third to her whole exports , and one third of her imports , consumes annually of her manufactures and produce six millions , and which is pre-eminently distinguished as the most secure and independent source of national prosperity , and a principal support of the naval superiority of this country ; and that this measure , if it should be carried into effect , must diminish in a very few years the property invested in Jamaica , and the other British West India islands , and open the means of hastening the progress of rival colonies , must forbid the supply of losses of negro population , which general causes , or accidents or diseases peculiar to the climate occasion , and which humane and provident management is unavailing to prevent ; must stop the completion of establishments already begun at a great expence , and put an end to the increase of small settlers in the interior of the islands , so necessary for their security ; and , in short , must inflict extreme injury and eventual decay and ruin upon those colonies ; and that an immediate consequence of the abolition will be , the loss of the white population of the colonies , at present composing the militia , the principal defence of the country , by taking away the hope and the means of bettering their fortunes , their only inducement for venturing to those islands ; and that many persons in the British West India colonies , already settled and attached to the soil , will from the same causes emigrate to countries where they will meet with more encouragement and protection ; and that those who must from necessity remain , will be left exposed to all the calamities attendant upon revolt and insurrection ; and that the operation of the bill , if it should pass into a 835 law , will be to violate the system of colonial law relative to property , the provisions of families , and the securities of creditors ; and that the petitioner assures the house , that his statements are founded on the basis of truth , that they are the result of the full and mature consideration of his constituents , whose local knowledge , and Whose due and fair regard to their own welfare , afford them the best opportunities of forming correct conclusions ; and that they can be established by , evidence ; and that the agitation of the question of the abolition of the slave trade is at all times pregnant with great mischief ; and that the petitioner must view with peculiar alarm the renewed discussion of that question , at a period when the existence of a black power in the neighbourhood of the island of Jamaica , affording a memorable and dreadful lesson recorded in characters of blood , of the issue of doctrines intimately , constantly , and inseparably connected with the abolition of the slave trade , ought most powerfully to have inculcated the necessity of discountenancing all such discussions , which tend to alienate the minds of the negroes in the British West India colonies from a state of subordination , and which hold forth no prospect whatever of real good , but on the contrary , if persevered in , will be a fruitful source of enormous evil ; and that the petitioner shrinks with horror from a contemplation of those scenes which that country has frightfully exhibited ; and that confiscation can not be authorized without proof of delinquency ; and that
