any increase of expenditure that might arise . The only two ways in which it could fail to afford alleviation were these : first , if the war taxes should fail during the war ; if that should be the case , it would not be the consequence of this plan more than any other . The failure would be in the nature of the tax itself , and would happen under any one plan as well as another . But if from any cause any of the present war taxes should fail , the house would tax other articles so as to keep up the present amount of revenue from the war taxes . Thus the plan did no more than we were liable to under the present system . As to the other point , that an increased expenditure was to be looked for , he took the actual state of our expenditure only as a secure foundation to reason upon . With respect to expeditions to the continent , or subsidies , there were no data to go upon . All he meant was , to shew the facility of providing for the present common expenditure to any length of time ; but he should be sorry in doing so to adopt any plan of a nature to preclude the house from accommodating the basis of that plan to any circumstances that might arise . Any plan not so applicable would be a very unfit basis for a system of finance . He did not like to assume at random an amount of contingent expences , or an increase of common expences , which would afford room only for reasoning as fallacious as its foundation . He had shewn that the falling in of annuities after those applied to the deferred stock would prevent the necessity of having recourse to any taxes for 3 years ; in the subsequent seven years 292,000l . a year would be wanted ; in the next ten years nothing . Supposing an expenditure of two millions for the continent , the foundation of the 817 plan would not be undermined , nor its firmness shaken . The only consequence would be , that from the increase of the war loans by this demand , the war taxes would be applicable in an inferior proportion to the supplementary loans . There would be 3 years still exempt from taxation by the falling in of annuities . In the subsequent 7 years 505,000l . annually would be wanted instead of 292,000l . to be raised by new taxes . In the five following years no taxes would be wanted , and in the last five years of the series only 330,000l . Thus , in the constant succession of the war taxes , and the relief from all further taxation for three years , the plan would be obviously beneficial , and only a moderate increase of taxes would be necessary in some parts of the period . He stated thus much to shew that he did not assume to legislate for the future without going on firm ground.â€”He was next to come more immediately to the plan proposed by the noble lord in his resolutions . These resolutions divided themselves into three points . The first and sixth related to the comparative effect of the present system and proposed plan ; and the ninth and tenth adopting the vices , as they had been termed , of his plan , were intended to shew , that the same means of relief would be afforded by the existing system as by the new plan . But the noble lord had assumed as a right , on his part , of the public to take from the sinking fund without giving any equivalent to the stockholders . He agreed with his right hon friend ( Mr. Tierney ) , that the sinking fund was first created not for the interest of the stockholder , but of the public . It was a boon in 1786 , granted by Mr. Pitt to the stockholders ; but , what was the situation of the stockholders who
