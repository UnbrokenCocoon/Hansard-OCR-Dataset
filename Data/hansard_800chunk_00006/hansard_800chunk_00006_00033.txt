's intelligence and magnanimity would disdain to receive as such—the interruption of his majesty 's intercourse with the court of Berlin during the last eight months , which precluded his majesty from any knowledge of those counsels by which the war between Prussia and France was so unfortunately precipitated.—Satisfied as we are of the justice of the original grounds of his majesty 's complaints against Prussia , we are yet unable to refrain from deeply deploring their consequences.—We are not furnished with any means of judging how far those complaints were capable of being adjusted , without recourse being had to actual hostilities ; 56 or how far any discussions which may have taken place subsequently to his majesty 's gracious message of the 21st of April , were directed to that object.—But we can not but lament that the obvious artifice of the common enemy , in making a fraudulent and nominal transfer of his majesty 's electoral dominions to the king of Prussia , should have been so far crowned with success as to have involved his majesty in war with the only state in Europe whose resources were yet unimpaired ; and whose arms might , at some happier hour , have been employed with effect in a new confederacy against France ; and that the too successful policy of the enemy in amusing this country with an insincere and protracted negociation , should have obtained for France the opportunity of goading Prussia ( by unmeasured and accumulated injuries ) to that premature , unconcerted , and unassisted effort ; which has terminated in the overthrow of that powerful monarchy , and in the complete subjugation of its dominions.—We can not but express our regret that the policy which appears to have been ultimately adopted towards Prussia should not have been recognized and acted upon until the occasion was gone by ; and that his majesty 's plenipotentiary should have arrived only in time to be an helpless witness of that prodigious ruin and destruction which a more timely interposition of his majesty 's advice and assistance might possibly have averted or alleviated.—To acknowledge his majesty 's goodness in having directed to be laid before us the details of the negociation so long carried on at Paris.—We entertain the fullest conviction that the just and moderate sentiments by which his majesty has proved himself to have been animated in the several preceding negociations for peace with France , have alike actuated his majesty on the late occasion : and while we look with anxious interest for the developement of those circumstances which can have deferred for so long a period that termination of the negociation which it is evident , as well from notorious facts as from the language of his majesty 's declaration , the artifices and pretensions of the enemy rendered from the beginning almost certain and unavoidable ; we doubt not but we shall see , in the whole course and tenour of the proceedings on the part of his majesty , fresh instances of that desire for peace , and of that sincerity and good faith in the pursuit of it , which have so often been frus- 57 trated by the ambition of the French government ; as well as fresh proofs of the expediency of adhering to the policy of treating for general peace , and only in conjunction with our allies.—That we receive with the utmost satisfaction the assurance of his majesty 's uninterrupted concert and good understanding with the emperor of Russia ; trusting that neither in war nor in negociation , his majesty 's councils will be separated from those of our ally , distinguished alike by perseverance and good faith.—The continued prosecution of the war being necessarily imposed upon his majesty , we rejoice in the assurance that it is intended to prosecute it with vigour : earnestly imploring his majesty that no apprehension of embarrassing the conduct of a negociation by acquisitions made during its progress , may ever again be suffered to relax for a moment the military and naval operations of this country.—That if we have not the triumph and satisfaction , as in
