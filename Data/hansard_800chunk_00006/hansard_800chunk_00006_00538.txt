upon paper , and , With their lordships ' permission , he would read them . His lordship read to the house Several observations similar in purport to those he had previously made , and afterwards Stated his plan , which proceeded upon the calculation of 12,000,000 of population ; then taking 3,000,000 ; at 6d . per day expenditure , the amount would be , for 3 millions , at 6d per day , 27,375,000l . ; for one million , at 1s per day , 18,250 ; 000l . ; at 2s . per day , 36,500,000l . ; at 2s . per day , 54,750,000l . at 4s . per day , 73,000,000l . ; at 5s . per day , 91,250,000l . ; at 10s ; per day , 182,500,000l . ; at 12s . per day , 219 ; 000,000l . ; at 15s . per day , 273,750,000l . ; at 20s . per day , 365,000,000l . ; total , 1,341,375,000l The classes up to 5s . inclusive , his lordship reckoned the employed , and the other classes the employers . Taking the population at 12,500,000 , there would remain 500,000 persons , whom he would suppose to spend 1000l . a year each , amounting to 500,000,000l . ; but even supposing that to be the case , he would make a present of that amount to their lordships , and rely upon the remainder , a small per centage upon which would produce considerably more than the property tax did at present , whilst it would fall equitably upon every one , and each would at once know what . he was to pay . He thought the best mode of proceeding would be to refer his plan to a committee , and concluded by making a motion to that effect . thought , that in point of form the motion could not be entertained by the house , as there was no paper before their lordships which could , consistently with the forms of the house , be referred to a committee . With respect to the plan proposed by the noble lord , he had considerable doubts of its efficiency . Expenditure was undoubtedly taken as one of the criterions of direct taxation , it being the sign of wealth ; but where the exigencies of the country required a large sum to be raised , the more the amount of taxation necessary to be raised was diffused in different channels , it would be found that the less was the pressure upon the people . It was unquestionably an object of the greatest importance where burthens were to be imposed upon the people , to make them fall as lightly as possible , and the great advantage of indirect taxation was , that it fell to a certain extent upon articles , respecting 1031 which it was in the power of the consumer to lessen his consumption of those articles , or leave them off altogether ; and thus the payment of these taxes was voluntary , as depending upon the consumption of the articles .. He admitted , with respect to the property tax , that it did not reach every , description of income , but au approximation was continually making to its more effectual operation upon those classes whom it was its object to include . The object of the noble ford appeared to be to simplify taxation , but he thought the effect of that simplification , as stated in the noble lord 's plan , would be much more oppressive than the system it was proposed to supercede , particularly as , according to the plan of the noble lord , the proposed taxation would fall heavily upon the poorer classes of the people , whilst the surplus property would escape its operation . said , his object was not to tax the poorer classes , the employed , but the employers . observed , that in the amount of population stated by the noble lord , a great number-of children must be reckoned , where expenditure of course could not be
