enthusiastically beloved , not by that house alone , or by the superior classes of society , but by a great majority of the meanest and most illiterate of the people . Dearer did the menaces of the enemy render these blessings ; notwithstanding that the acknowledged superiority of our navy , the bravery of our army , and the high and united spirit of our population , warranted us in setting those menaces at defiance . As to the enemy 's attempts to destroy or injure the commerce of Great Britain , he flattered himself , that those hopes would be completely disappointed ; and that , secure in our capital and our credit , we might deride the vain efforts of an implacable foe . Adverting to that part of his majesty 's speech , in which the necessity of enduring great burthens was lamented , he observed that , deeply as the weight of those burthens must be felt , he was convinced that with that feeling would be mingled throughout the country a firm conviction of the necessity which existed of imposing them , of bearing them with good humour , and of making those sacrifices which , under the present circumstances , a great nation was called upon to make . With these advantages , he could not believe that the house would , for a moment , hesitate in adopting the only line of conduct which , as it appeared to him , they could with propriety pursue , namely , to pledge themselves to meet the exigencies of this great crisis with firmness , and to make provision for calling the strength of the country into energetic exertion .
