in finding out proper objects of taxation , as a proof that new taxes could not be raised . But he fully admitted that it was highly expedient to impose no new taxes , for the present , if it could be avoided . This was his opinion , and it was sanctioned by that of the noble lord 's predecessor . New taxes to any great extent would occasion a very heavy pressure on the people at present . Then what other resources were there ? There were two , namely , the war taxes and the sinking fund . His noble friend ( Castlereagh ) objected to the plan of compound loans . But whether the borrowing was from the consolidated fund or the war taxes , there must be supplementary loans . To a certain extent , therefore , he saw no objection to borrowing from the war taxes . But he must object to the system of pledging the whole of the war taxes , independent of the property tax , and at last the property tax also . The noble lord ought to borrow only on such as might be supposed to yield their fullest amount in time of peace . He might continue the war for five years , by borrowing 799 on this portion of the war taxes . The sum of 11 millions might be annually borrowed in this way , or 13 millions , if necessary , and for those sums the permanently productive war taxes , with the expiring annuities , would afford an ample provision for five years . He thought the war taxes ought not to be pledged to a greater amount , as it was contrary to the policy of this country . The convoy tax , for instance , could not properly continue beyond the duration of the war . The taxes on tea and spirits also would certainly be diminished in their amount during peace . Could the noble lord possibly expect that these would always yield their present amount ? He surely could not , and yet this plan took the whole of these taxes at their highest amount . The noble lord might so manage as to increase the amount of the war taxes , when the loans must be procured on disadvantageous terms , and diminish their amount when the loans could be contracted for on easy terms . He ought to recollect the nature of his system of ways and means . He ought to consider the furious objections made to the property tax , which was called a system not of taxation , but of confiscation . He ought therefore to pause before he pledged this and other taxes.â€”But if he had great doubts as to the propriety of pledging the war taxes to the full extent proposed by the noble lord , he had still stronger doubts respecting the data on which the plan was founded . The noble lord supposed that the war expenses would not exceed 32 millions annually during the whole period . He could not reasonably conclude that there was any probability that this would be the case . He ought to have taken into account the subsidies that might be wanted , and the depreciation of money which must take place in the course of that time . It was true that the noble lord had stated , that for subsidies a distinct provision must be made , but at the same time they ought rather to have been taken into the general account of expenditure , as it was unusual to provide for subsidies distinctly by that name . The right hon . gent . then stated his objection to the system of the accumulation of the sinking fund , and providing for the loans at 5 per cent . instead of one per cent . according to the old plan , as it afforded an undue advantage to the stockholder , at the expense of the public . He had great objections to the plan of accumulation adopted in 1802 . It never was 800 the object of the original proposer of
