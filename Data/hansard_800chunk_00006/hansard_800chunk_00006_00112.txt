by the noble lord , that no negociation should be entered into , unless the first overtures were specifically committed to writing , was , he would affirm , entirely novel and unprecedented . Nothing was so general as to commence with verbal communications , and then to proceed to written documents . In this instance the first propositions were made verbally , but then in every subsequent dispatch to both lords Yarmouth and Lauderdale , it was prescribed to have their propositions committed to writing , and there was no dispatch transmitted by those noble lords to 296 his majesty 's ministers in which it did not appear that they uniformly dwelt upon that point . Indeed lord Yarmouth was sent back to Paris for the special purpose of having the communications verbally made to him committed to writing . There was , therefore , no degree of incorrectness , inaccuracy , or looseness , in the conduct of this negociation , on the part of this country , whatever might have been the misconduct of France . Unless , indeed , the noble lord opposite could allege it as an accusation against his majesty 's ministers that the French government had receded from their first propositions ; unless he could shew that our government manifested a disposition to treat upon a different basis , or had actually proposed such basis ; or rather , unless he could cancel from the recollection of their lordships and the country the positive directions to lord Yarmouth to abandon the negociation altogether if the French government would not treat on the grounds proposed in the first instance , it was impossible the noble lord could make out the charges he had endeavoured to establish against the conduct of his majesty 's ministers . So precise were ministers on this point , that lord Yarmouth was instructed not to produce his full powers to the French ministers until the propositions verbally made to him should be formally confirmed by being committed to writing ; until he should have a written document from the French government . The circumstance of that noble lord 's having produced those powers before his instructions were complied with , it was now unnecessary to discuss ; whatever might have been the merits of that transaction , sure he was that no one would question the motives of that noble lord , or doubt for a moment that his conduct was actuated by the most sincere and ardent wishes for the interests of his country . It was , however , clear , from the instructions given to that nobleman , that his majesty 's ministers used every means to obtain from the French government a written acknowledgement of its views , as stated in its first communications by the same nobleman . For that purpose lord Lauderdale was sent to Paris . At least that was the first object to which he was to attend . That nobleman 's instructions were , to have committed to writing the first propositions of the French government , including of course the uti possidetis , or else to return to England.—The noble lord concluded with ob- 297 serving , that he was induced to rise , only with a view to elucidate the two points alluded to by the noble lord opposite , namely , with regard to the statement in his majesty 's declaration respecting the uti possidetis , and also in regard to the conduct of the negociation , upon both which points he hoped that he had succeeded in satisfying the house that the noble lord 's censures were unfounded , that the statement in the Declaration of his majesty was fully sustained by the facts of the case , and that the conduct of the great statesman who was now no more , was not in any instance more strongly entitled to the esteem , the gratitude , and the admiration of his country—that , instead of having deserved the charge of inaccuracy or incorrectness , his management of this negociation was marked by the most perfect regularity . in explanation , disclaimed any intention of casting
