the end of 7 and 14 years ; but that the men who were entitled by having served so long , were to have the increased 473 proportion of pay and allowance . In a subsequent discussion the right hon . gentleman had stated , that it was intended to discharge the men who had served 21 years , with full pensions . He wished to know whether this intention had been carried into effect ? Whether the men who had served 21 years were discharged , or still retained in service ; if they were retained in service , whether it was voluntary ; and if it was voluntary , whether they had the increased advantages of pay and allowances ; and also , it they had been discharged , whether they had the full pensions ? said , it had been in contemplation at the period alluded to by the noble lord , to discharge with full pensions the men who had served 21 years . His own opinion as to the propriety of that proceeding was still the same . But it was a point that rested with the discretion of his majesty 's government generally ; and which had not yet been decided upon . The men who had served that period of time had not demanded their discharges , they of course remained still in the service , having all the advantages of pay and allowances which the vote of last session granted .
