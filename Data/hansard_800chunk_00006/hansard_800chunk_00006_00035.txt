59 for the certain , permanent , and large addition which they have necessarily occasioned to the military expenditure of the state.—We shall investigate with equal care , the state of our other military establishments , and particularly that of the volunteers , the cheap , efficient , and patriotic defence of the united kingdom ; we trust and believe that we shall find them , in spite of all discouragement and discountenance , neither abated in zeal , nor , as yet , materially reduced in numbers , at a period when it appears but too probable that their services may be more than ever essential to their country.—That we are fully sensible of his majesty 's paternal affection for his subjects , manifested in the regret which he expresses at being compelled to call upon them for sacrifices of so great an extent as may be necessary in the present crisis of affairs . That however painful the duty of imposing fresh burthens upon the people , we shall , however , not shrink from discharging it ; satisfied as we are of the prevailing determination of all ranks of the community to submit with cheerfulness to the indispensable necessity of providing means for the continuance of a contest , in the issue of which public safety and private happiness are alike inseparably involved.—That it is a consolation to us as to his majesty under the pressure of this inevitable necessity , to learn the flourishing state of public credit , and the productiveness of the several branches of the revenue : and that we agree entirely with his majesty in attributing these salutary effects in a great measure to the system so wisely begun , and so properly persevered in , of raising a considerable proportion of the supplies within the year , a system which has happily disappointed the predictions of the external and internal enemies of his majesty and his government.—That we earnestly wish it were in our power to close our address here .

But we can not reflect without concern and disapprobation upon the circumstances of surprise and de- 60 ception which attended the sudden exercise of that prerogative in the dissolution of the late parliament ; and particularly of his servants to mislead upon the irreverent use of his majesty 's royal name in a proclamation summoning the late parliament to meet on a fixed and no distant day , issued at a period , when the measure of dissolving that parliament must already have been in contemplation.—Connected also with this subject , we can not forbear to notice rumours which strongly prevail throughout the country , of the most improper and unconstitutional interference of his majesty 's ministers in the course of the late Elections : rumours at once highly discreditable and injurious to his majesty 's government , and to the independent character of parliament.—We hope that upon enquiry and examination they may be proved to be utterly unfounded.—But , convinced as we are , that the tendency ( though we trust not the effect ) of such interference , as is alledged , must have been to revolt and disgust the well-affected part of the community , and to sow distraction and discontent in place of that unanimity which is so loudly called for , at a moment when the prosperity of the British empire depends upon the consenting and cordial co-operation of all orders and descriptions of the people ; convinced also , that it is our peculiar duty , as it is the common interest of all those who prize , as it deserves , the inestimable blessing of a free form of government , to mark with
