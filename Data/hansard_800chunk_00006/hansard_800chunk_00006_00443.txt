preserve this trade , pronounced by par 831 liament to be highly advantageous to Great Britain , and necessary for supplying her plantations and colonies with a sufficient number of negroes ; and that the British West India colonies were settled , and have ever been cultivated , under the solemn faith of those charters and proclamations , and of those laws which have confirmed the West India colonists in the most perfect assurance and confidence that they should continue to obtain supplies of negroes from Africa ; and that the cultivation of those colonies can not be carried on without supplies of African negroes ; and that the settling of the interior of those islands , which is greatly conducive to their safety , can not he promoted , if the slave trade shall be abolished ; and that , if the bill should be passed into a law , the worst consequences will ensue from it , destructive not only to the properties of the British planters , and of their creditors , whose fortunes have assisted in cultivating the plantations in the West Indies , and are now secured upon them , but also deeply injurious to the interests of the British empire at large , as all descriptions of property in this kingdom must suffer most severely by the effects of a plan that shall operate to destroy the great capital invested in the British West India colonies , and to cut off a commerce which pays in duties annually to Great Britain upwards of three millions , employs more than sixteen thousand seamen , contributes one third to her whole exports , and one third to her imports , consumes annually of her manufactures and produce six millions , and which is preeminently distinguished as the most secure and independant source of national prosperity , and a principal support of the naval superiority of this country ; and that this measure , if it should be carried into effect , must diminish , in a very few years , the property invested in the British West India islands , and open the means of hastening the progress of rival colonies ; must forbid the supply of losses of negro population , which general causes , or accidents , or diseases peculiar to the climate , occasion , and which humane and provident management is unavailing to prevent ; must stop the completion of establishments already begun , at a great expence , and put an end to the increase of small settlers in the interior of the islands , so necessary for their security ; and , in short , must inflict extreme present injury , and eventual decay and ruin , upon 832 those colonies ; and that an immediate consequence of the abolition will be the loss of the white population of the colonies , at present composing the militia , the principal defence of the country , by taking away the hope and the means of bettering their fortunes , their only inducement for venturing to those islands ; and that many persons in the West India colonies , already settled and attached to the soil , will , from the same causes , emigrate to countries where they will meet with more encouragement and protection ; and that those who must , from necessity , remain , will be left exposed to all the calamities attendant upon revolt and insurrection ; and that the operation of the bill , if it shall pass into a law , will be to violate the system of colonial law , relative to property , the provisions of families , and the securities of creditors ; and that the petitioners assure the house , that their statements are founded on the basis of truth ; that they are advanced by those , whose local knowledge , and whose due and fair regard to their own welfare , afford them the best opportunities of forming correct conclusions , and that they can be established by evidence ; and that the agitation of the question of an abolition of the slave trade is at all times pregnant
