to have been simply the desire to avoid any technical basis , as utterly inapplicable to the existing state of the world , 394 and as likely to require ( as the noble lord has himself contended would have been the case with the stipulations of the treaty of Amiens , and as I think I have shewn would equally have arisen in any attempt to apply the uti possidetis ) more time in the application and adjustment of the basis , than would have been sufficient to discuss and settle the terms of the most complicated negociation.—It remains to shew , in the 3d place , that , supposing the offer of the uti possidetis to have been unequivocally made , and afterwards departed from ; and supposing the recognition of it to have been as important to us as it is now pretended , we took the very worst course for obtaining that recognition . And this I really think it impossible for any man to doubt , who will take a fair review of the correspondence upon the table , and who will only consult his own feelings and common sense , and reason from the analogies of private life to the case before him.—I am not the champion of French good faith in general , nor of M. Talleyrand 's in particular ; but I believe it is pretty clear with respect to M. Talleyrand , or any other man living , that when he has once committed himself by a direct disavowal of any thing which he may have said , or may have been supposed to have said , in a private conference , there can be no rational hope of inducing him to retract that disavowal merely by a sturdy repetition of the assertion that he did say that which he has thus disavowed . When two parties in a discussion are thus directly committed against each other , it is evident that to persist in re-affirming what your antagonist must as constantly re-deny , is only equivalent to a determination to make no progress whatever . There are obviously but two modes of proceeding in such a case which can be resorted to with any chance of advantage ; and your choice between the two must depend upon the manner in which you estimate the point in dispute . If you consider it as a point of honour ; if you feel that the faith of your own negociator is compromised against that of the enemy 's , and that both can not come with credit out of the discussion , every other object ought of course to give way to this consideration ; and you can in that case do no otherwise than break off the negociation upon the very first peremptory denial by the enemy , of the first distinct assertion on your part . A contest for three months of `` You did say so , '' on one side , and `` I did not , '' on the other , is undigni- 395 fied and discreditable to both parties . If , on the other hand , the obtaining the admission itself was so great an object that you would be content to sacrifice a little punctilio to obtain it , then is it not plain to any man 's understanding , that instead of pressing and pinning your adversary into a corner , and insisting upon his making the recognition which you demand of him in a precise form of words that should carry his own self-contradiction upon the face of them , you ought , as soon and as decently as you could , to have afforded him a retreat and outlet from the difficulty in which his first denial had involved him ; you ought to have changed your first peremptory interrogation of `` Will you confess that you did propose the uti possidetis ? '' into the milder form of `` Will you now agree to it ? '' If the practical concession was to be obtained , this was the only way to go about it : but with a curious felicity
