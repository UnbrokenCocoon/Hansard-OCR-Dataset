very solemn declaration of the inestimable value to the constitution of the prerogative vested in his majesty of dissolving parliament , and of the free indisputable right which his majesty has to exercise that right at all times , has not scrupled to enter into a long detail of reasons why the prerogative ought not to have been exercised , as it has recently 27 been exercised by his majesty . I should have been surprised at any noble lord in the house standing up in his place to question the exercise of a prerogative so clearly inherent in his majesty , and so indubitably useful ; but that a noble baron should after a preface so magnificent as to the value of this prerogative , of its sacred quality , of its being above all questionâ€”make a direct charge against his majesty 's ministers for having advised the exercise of it , is really what I can not reconcile with any rules of rational conduct . For myself , sacred as I hold every prerogative of the crown , I feel that his majesty 's servants are answerable for the advice which they give his majesty for the exercise , or for abstaining from the exercise of every one of them . In no case do I conceive the exercise of this undoubted prerogative to have been more wise , more salutary , or more attentive , on the part of his majesty , to the feelings of his people , than the dissolution which lately took place . When a negociation , by which his majesty 's endeavour to restore the blessings of peace , not merely to the people of Great Britain , but to the nations of Europe , had failed , it was surely a wise measure in his majesty to appeal to the sense of his people , to refer to them the conduct of his servants , and thereby to call upon them to pronounce , in the eyes of the world , their sense as to the further prosecution of the contest . If at any moment of our history the exercise of this prerogative was wise , proper and discreet , it was upon the late occasion , and the empire has gained this great and important advantage from the measure , that the degree of unanimity which has been manifested by the people from one end of the united kingdom to the other on the subject of the war , on the determination to persevere in the struggle , on the necessity of vigorous exertions , and in the approbation of the steps which have been taken by his majesty 's servants , has given strength , confidence , and spirit to the government ; and has given a noble example to the world of the vigour of a people who understand the blessings of independence , and who are determined to maintain it . But the noble baron , after disclaiming all intention , of disputing the right of his majesty to exercise his prerogative at all times , without question , has not scrupled to say that , with the exception of one solitary instance , it has not been exercised since the year 1715 , at shorter intervals than 6 years . I am 28 inclined to doubt the accuracy of the noble baron 's chronology . I think that , upon looking back , lie will find himself deceived in his calculation . But , however that may be , the fact of dissolution at periods of 6 sessions , would totally destroy the reasoning of the noble baron ; for if his majesty can thus dissolve unquestioned at the end of 6 sessions , when the legal period of the parliament is 7 years , he may as well exercise the right at the end of 4 sessions . Or , on the other hand , if his majesty , or rather his ministers , are to be questioned when this prerogative is exercised oftener than at intervals of six sessions , then the prerogative is no longer of the quality which the noble baron
