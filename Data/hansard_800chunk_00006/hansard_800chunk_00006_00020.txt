, was by 36 no means either novel or extraordinary : a disturbance , which sufficient experience had ascertained , went to the complete destruction of ancient and venerable estates , at least to a degradation of them so humiliating as to leave little choice between that and their complete destruction . But , although every successive disaster prepared the mind in some measure for the present state of affairs ; yet it was not without the utmost awe and inquietude that we could behold the period , so long menaced , at length arrived : a period when the power of the enemy was predominant and unlimited over the greater part of Europe , and when Great Britain , with the exception of two powerful allies , was left unsupported and compelled to rely for its security on those resources , on which , he was confident , we might rely implicitly—the natural courage and the unparalleled spirit of the people . It was impossible , therefore , not to consider the meeting of a new British Parliament , under such trying and arduous circumstances , as a most important event . Their deliberations would be looked to by their country , by their enemy , and by their allies , with the utmost anxiety . By their country , with the expectation that their proceedings would be distinguished by consistency and resolution ; by their enemy , with the hope—disappointed as he trusted it would prove —that in their councils might be detected an auspicious prognostic of alarm , wavering , and disunion ; by their allies , with the anticipation of increasing confidence and co-operation.—In his majesty 's most gracious speech , which had just been read from the chair , their attention was principally drawn to two topics . The first was the fruitless Negociation with France . Nothing could be further from his intention than to touch on any subject which in the remotest degree might tend to revive political differences , now almost lost in the disastrous events in which we were so nearly interested ; but he thought , without any hazard of such a revival , he might say , whether the pacific system so strongly recommended during the last war was practicable or not , that when the advocates for that system came into power , it was at a time when their hopes of carrying that system into effect must have been considerably diminished . In the event of peace with France , and of the mediation of other powers , to produce that event , it was necessary , indispensably necessary , 37 that we should be strong ourselves , and backed by strong and formidable allies and mediators , to whom we might make an effectual appeal , and from whom we might expect effectual assistance . To go to war might be merely the effort of despair , but to become a mediator and an abritrator among nations , required strength to support the award . It followed , therefore , that although at an earlier period France might have been successfully resisted by the pursuance of a pacific system , yet it became a far different case when so many rivals lay at her mercy ; when their resources were exhausted ; when their territories were dismembered ; when their armies were overcome ; and when their spirits were abashed and dismayed before the overwhelming superiority of France.—Under these inauspicious circumstances , so little calculated to produce a pacific disposition on the part of France , or to induce a corresponding inclination on the part of other powers ; under these inauspicious circumstances , the negociation was begun . It was begun because ministers advised his majesty to take advantage of the opening presented by the enemy ; because it was deemed advisable to endeavour to put a stop to those encroachments of which experience had too fatally shewn that a state of hostility was the increaser ; and because it was so desirable an object to collect what might be termed the relics of the continent , and by peace give to various powers the
