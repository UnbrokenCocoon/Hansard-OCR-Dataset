an increase of debt night be compensated by an amelioration in the Sinking Fund , and therefore the comparison of the debt alone would not suffice . If 11 millions were to be borrowed every year for 20 years , the amount of the Public Debt at that time , according to the calculations in the noble lord 's tables , would be in money value , 270,443,305l . The present amount in money value , was 363,793,722l . Thus there would be a decrease of debt according to the old system , to so considerable an amount as 93,350,417l . According to the new system of the noble lord , the money value of the debt would be in the present year 364,993,722l . The amount in 1826 , would be 455,537,932l . This would be an increase of debt in money value of 90,544,210l which , added to 93,350,417l . the diminution that might be effected by adhering to the old system , would make a total disadvantage of 183,894,667l . in amount of debt in money value , together with 196,000,000l . increase of capital borrowed from the adoption of the new plan—He would now proceed to compare the effect of the two plans with respect to the Sinking Fund . According to the old system , the present amount of the Fund was 8,515,042l . In 1826 it would be , following still the calculations in the noble lord 's tables , 27,115,881l . being an increase in 20 years of 18,610,839l . According to the plan of the noble lord the amount of the Sinking Fund in the present year would be 8,935,942l . In 1826 it would be 26,901,360l . affording an increase of 17,966,318l . in 20 years ; but falling short of the improvement by the old system in 644,421l . According to the new plan there would be but a sinking fund of 26,901,360l . on an increased debt of 455,537,932l . while the present system would , if followed , give a sinking fund of 27,115,881l . on the reduced debt of 270,443,305l . The proportion of the sinking fund to the debt , under the present plan , would be in 1826 , above 1–10th ; according to the noble lord 's plan , it would be but 1–17th . According to the present system , the interest on the Sinking Fund would go on accumulating at compound interest till the debt would be extinguished . According to the new Plan , having reached 732 its maximum of 28,155,358l . in the year 1820 , would have descended to 26,901,360l . in the year 1825 , and would continue to decline so long as the excesses would be applied to pay the interest of Supplementary Loans . He wished the noble lord to continue the calculations of four of his own tables , from years beyond the year 1826 . Nothing further would be requisite to prove to him the fallacy of his plan.—The next point of comparison was , the charge of borrowing 11,000,000l.—The charge for Interest and Sinking Fund for this loan would be , according to the present system , 733,333l . The amount of charges for these Loans for 20 years , or 220,000,000l . would be 14,666,660l . According to the new Plan , the charge for Supplementary Loans , amounting in 20 years to 204,000,000l . would be 14,266,388l . And the loss by War Taxes mortgaged for 14 years , till liberated , in successive portions , according to the series in which they had been appropriated , 21,000l . The charges of the Supplementary Loans , only under the new plan , would amount to within 370,272l . of the whole charges under the present system ; with the additional loss of the whole of the war taxes mortgaged away for war loans , for 14 years ; under these circumstances the house would not be at a loss to decide to which of the two systems the preference was due.—The next point of comparison was the relative means of relieving the country from taxes , and he admitted that if
