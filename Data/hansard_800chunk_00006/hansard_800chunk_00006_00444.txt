with great mischief ; and that the petitioners must view , with peculiar alarm , a renewed discussion of that question , at a period when the existence of a black power , in the neighbourhood of the most important British island in the West Indies , affording a memorable and dreadful lesson , recorded in characters of blood , of the issue of doctrines intimately , constantly , and inseparably connected with the abolition of the slave trade , ought most powerfully to have inculcated the necessity of discountenancing all such discussions , which tend to alienate the minds of the negroes in the British West India colonies from a state of subordination , and which hold forth no prospect whatever of real good , but , on the contrary , if persevered in , will be a fruitful source of enormous evil ; and that the petitioners shrink , with horror , from a contemplation of those scenes , which that country has frightfully exhibited ; and that confiscation can not be authorized without proof of delinquency ; and that the characters of the petitioners have been traduced , but delinquency has never been proved ; and that the petitioners , duly weighing these considerations , and apprized of the constant exer 833 tions displayed by the commons in parliament assembled , in raising this country to its present state of power and security , are desirous of expressing their reliance , that the wise interposition of the house will reject a measure , which can not be adopted without occasioning so great a sacrifice of the national resources , at a juncture when those resources are more than ever necessary to enable the country to make head against the most formidable enemy it ever had to contend with ; and therefore praying , that the said bill may not pass into a law ; and that they may be heard , at the bar of the house , by themselves , or their counsel , against the same , and that they may be permitted to produce evidence . '' A Petition of Edmund Pusey Lyon , esq . agent for the island of Jamaica , was also presented to the house , and read ; setting forth , ? That the petitioner observes with the deepest concern and alarm , that a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade has passed the house of lords , and is now depending before this house ; and that the fatal tendency of the measure of abolishing the slave trade , and the destructive consequences which must result from its accomplishment , have impelled the petitioner 's constituents to instruct him to give the most strenuous opposition to this bill ; and that the trade to Africa for labourers has been for a great number of years sanctioned , approved , and encouraged , by royal charters and proclamations , and by repeated acts of the British legislature , which declare in the strongest terms a most anxious desire to regulate , extend , secure , and preserve this trade , pronounced by parliament to be highly advantageous to Great Britain , and necessary for supplying her plantations and colonies with a sufficient number of negroes ; and that the British West India colonies were settled , and have ever been cultivated under the solemn faith of those charters and proclamations , and of those laws which have confirmed the West India colonists in the most perfect assurance and confidence , that they should continue to obtain supplies of negroes from Africa ; and that the cultivation of the island of Jamaica can not be carried on without supplies of African negroes ; and that the settling of the interior of that colony , which is greatly conducive to its safety , can not be promoted if the slave trade shall be abolished ; and that if the bill should be passed into a law , the worst consequences will en 834 sue from it , destructive not only to the properties of his constituents , and the proprietors of the other British West India colonies , and
