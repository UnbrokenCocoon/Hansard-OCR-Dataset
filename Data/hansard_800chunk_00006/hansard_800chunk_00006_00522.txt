supply itself is lessening , and the need of that supply lessening too ? And this we find is pro–gressively effecting without violence , with–out a measure that may elevate the Blacks into a phrenzy , and plunge the Whites into despair . Admit however , that population by natural means is generally on the ad–vance , or rather that , barring accidents , the decrease is less rapid than it has been , this will not reach individual cases , nor will it remedy those accidents which humanity and vigilance neither can foresee nor pre–vent , and which have so often depopulated particular districts and whole islands.—There have been , sir , in the course of the debate , different measures of gradual abo–lition proposed , as substitutes for this bill . I can not engage to support them ; but , considering the disposition now pre–vailing in parliament , it may be said that his majesty 's ministers , in respect to this measure , are all powerful ; they need no concurrence on our side ; and the respon–sibility rests upon them not to inflict a se–vere and a dangerous remedy , if a safer and a milder will answer the purposes of humanity as well . Of the instances of cruelty which an hon . general ( sir John Doyle ) has detailed to the house , two , I ob–serve , were perpetrated by females ; and I hope that the trite observation , corruptio bonarum pessima , may be applied to these cases . If there exist the smallest doubt whether the general treatment of the slaves in the West Indies be kind and humane , why not send out , as has been suggested , a par–liamentary commission , to enquire into and to report the facts , rather than subject a large class of British subjects to the odium of their countrymen , by presenting , under aggravated colours , a few instances of atrocity , committed by individuals , of whom good and bad are to be found in every society ? I can state , with the utmost truth , that I have been connected as a merchant with about 60 estates in the island of Jamaica , and that , in the late distresses of the trade , we have been compelled to ob–serve the utmost economy in the amount and value of the supplies sent out ; and yet 991 in not one single instance have we curtailed , or been desired to curtail , the articles which have been sent out for the use and comfort of the negroes , although , in almost every instance , we have done so in respect to those for the use of the whites.—There is not yet , sir , any distinct under–standing whether this bill is or is not to be accompanied with a provision of compensation for those whom its operation may injure ; and , unless some pledge to that ef–fect be given , I must consider that the in–justice it may inflict upon individuals is a fair argument against its principle . The noble lord ( Howick ) has stated , that it has not been usual for parliament on simi–lar occasions to provide compensation prospectively ; and yet , sir , in those recent instances in which the legislature judged it fit to interfere merely with ancient usages ( not with rights established under acts of parliament ) for the sake of effecting improvements in the port of London ; I mean in the West-India and London dock acts—a provision of prospective compensa–tion , most liberal in its extent , is made for every description of persons to whose loss or injury those bills might operate . This , sir , is what we have done ; and let me state a case which may happen , nay , which pro–bably will happen , if the spirit of reform be consistent . There are , sir , in this country , and more especially in the northern coun–ties , many large factories built , where 3 or 400 persons are often confined together employed in
