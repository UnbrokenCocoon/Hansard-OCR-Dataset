the spinning of cotton and silk : I am prepared to say , sir , and there are many in this house who can confirm it , that those establishments , although highly advantageous in a commercial view , are fatal both to the health and to the morals of his majesty 's subjects : now , supposing that the philanthropic spirit were to be ex–tended to them , and their further exten–sion at least forbidden ; supposing we were to say , `` We pretend not to interfere with what exists already ; keep the labourers you have got , we will not emancipate them , they are not fit for emancipation , they are corrupted and disordered , and incapable of the regular duties of life ; but not one more ruddy-cheeked boy or blooming girl shall you seduce from their ignorant and deluded parents , and immure in your putrid haunts of vice and disease . Tell us not of your ventilators and your artificial gasses ; the thing is contrary to first principles , and it must be discontinued . '' Now , can we believe that he who had just built , at a con ? 992 siderable expence , one of these factories , and had partially , or not at all , supplied it with labourers , would not this case call aloud for compensation ? and could that compensation be justly denied to him ? And yet , sir , the silk and cotton factor has not greater legislative authority to plead than has the West-India planter for his establish–ment ; nor is the supposed case which I have put of the former harder than the real one of the latter , after this bill passes ; and , independently of the general case , there are individual cases of peculiar hard–ship , those of minors , of lessors , and of proprietors of estates under trust , whose estates , immediately after this bill passes , will be either considerably depreciated , or of no value at all.—There are some , sir , who will admit the truth of many of the considerations I have urged : they will admit that we are about to make a sacrifice that is to cost us much , and to profit others little or nothing . `` But , '' say they , `` there is connected with the slave trade much abuse and much inhumanity , and , at all events , we will wash our hands of any share in it ; we will have nothing to do with that which is either the offspring or the pa–rent of vice . '' Gentlemen should consider , sir , how far they would follow this prin–ciple , and whither it would lead them : it would certainly go the length of suppressing the licensing of alehouses , and the continuance of lotteries : can the mischiefs with which these are connected in society be doubted ? If , sir , I were inclined to at–tempt the feelings of gentlemen in this house with a pathetic story , I could shew them , and at no great distance from the metropolis , an industrious mother with 6 or 8 children , their countenances pale , their limbs emaciated , and their bodies swoln with famine , picking up a scan–ty and insufficient subsistence by the only labour which such feeble hands can execute , while the father of this family , he who ought to support them , is taking what is called a plunge at the neighbouring ale–house , spending the fruits of one week 's labour , and mortgaging that of another ; and this after having carried away the lea–thern bag from the cottage roof , which con–tained the pence and sixpences , the hard savings of the year ( saved to pay the rent at Lady-day ) , and having sunk the whole of it with one of those itinerant propagators of ruin who now invade the privacy of your remotest villages with a cart stuck over with lottery bills . This , sir , is not a fictitious nor
