spoke early in this debate , bore much too hard upon the noble earls in attributing to them any blame for their conduct at this crisis . They insisted upon their passports , and reiterated their request in a laconic , and forcible manner , such as could give no reason to doubt of their being sufficiently alive to the insult which was 355 offered to their mission , and of the necessity there was for full and immediate apology and redress . But , sir , the 11th of August produced another note , signed by MM . Clarke and Champagny , far different in its language and tenour from the intemperate paper which had been before delivered , and which seems to me to have been calculated to remove all the difficulties created by the unfortunate adoption of the two baneful words which destroyed the power of treating.â€” Sir , I beg the favour of my noble friend , and of the house , to peruse with attention the following paragraph , contained in this note , signed by MM . Champagny and Clarke . `` In laying down the principle of uti possidetis , have the English plenipotentiaries had it in view to propose a means of exchange and of compensation ? If this is the meaning , the emperor adopts it , because it appears to him conformable to the two principles already agreed upon by both parties . '' And having considered the import of this declaration , I request them to compare it with the paragraph contained in the first note signed by lord Lauderdale , part of which I have before quoted , `` He can not consent to treat upon any other principle but that of the uti possidetis , as originally proposed to his sovereign by the court of France ; at the same time he desires it should be well understood , that the adoption of this principle will not prevent him either from listening to any just and adequate indemnification to his Sicilian majesty for the cession of Sicily , or from accepting any proposition for the exchange of territory between the two contracting parties , upon just and equal principles , such as may tend to the reciprocal advantage of the two countries . '' ( p . 148 . ) Having compared these declarations , I would put it to my noble friend , to the house , and to the world , whether there is any substantial , nay , whether there is any formal difference between them ? Why then did not the negociation proceed ? the obstacle was removed ; why was it revived ? the simple answer , yes , on the part of England ; which was the true , the obvious , the politic , the only answer to be given to the question of France , would have broken this unhappy barrier to treating between the two countries , and would have allowed of an immediate investigation , whether such terms as are described in the note of lord Lauderdale could be actually accepted 356 or offered . Here , in my opinion , a golden opportunity was lost , not indeed of making peace ; I can not tell whether peace would have been the issue , nor am I called upon for an opinion upon that point ; but of ascertaining whether peace could be made . But , sir , as this opportunity , amongst others , was missed , it is impossible for me to say , that the continuation of hostilities is entirely owing to the injustice and ambition of France ; and that `` with her altogether rests the awful responsibility . '' [ Vide Declaration , p . 212 . ] It was not possible , certainly , for the English plenipotentiaries to return an answer to this note without an explanation on the subject of the passports which had been so unwarrantably withheld . They consulted their dignity ; a previous explanation was demanded ; an apology was made ; and an answer was returned . It was in adverting to this
