will afford great encouragement to the smuggler in peace ; the consumption of which has been nearly doubled since 1786.—Rum—When Mr. Pitt came into office , the duty was 6s . 6d . a gallon , which in 1784 was lowered to 4s . 8d . and that not succeeding , it was farther reduced in 1786 to 4s . The legal consumption then was 842,000 gallons , and on on average of ten years 1,342,000 gallons , but got up on an average of ten years to 1806 , to 2,441,000 gallons . The duty is now 11s . 0½d . of which 3s . 5½d . is a War Tax , leaving 6s . 11d . permanent.—Brandy—When Mr. Pitt came into office the duty Was 9s . 6¾d . a gallon , which was reduced in 1807 , to 5s . ; the consumption then was 754,000 gallons , and on an average of ten years 611,965 gallons , but increased to an average of 1,580,000 gallons , on the average of ten years to 1806 . The duty is now 13s . 8½d . of which 4s . 2½d is a War Tax , leaving 8s . 5d . permanent . If therefore the War Taxes on these two articles should be allowed to expire with the war , the remaining duty on the former would be something higher than when the consumption was the lowest , and on the latter would be within 1s . a gallon . It is therefore clear , without going into a minute calculation , that in both rum and brandy the revenue would lose considerably by a continuation of the War Tax in peace , if the consumption should be reduced to any thing like what it was previous to the reduction of the duties . It was indeed frequently urged to Mr. Pitt that he would not be able to continue the whole of the permanent duty in peace , and he always admitted the possibility of its being found necessary , to reduce even that.—British Spirits—Another productive article , the duty on which has always borne a proportion to that on foreign spirits , would necessarily be given up if the War Tax on foreign spirits should be allowed to expire.—Goods and Wares—Under this head , by much the most productive article is sugar ; —it was understood the merchants and planters had assurances the duty should ex 808 pire with the war , on its having been made evident that a continuance of it in peace would be ruinous to them , from a certainty that the price of the article would , as in former instances , fall much lower than the saving by insurance and freight.—Cotton Wool , as a raw material , is a manufacture , in which we are in some branches rivalled on the Continent , can not certainly bear a tax in peace.—Wine—The whole duty in this article is permanent , but Mr. Pitt considered the last 20l . a ton as a War Tax ; and therefore , did not apply it to pay the interest of any Loan . The duty before the consolidation in 1787 , was 47l . 9s . to London—it was then reduced to 31l . 10s.—and the quantity retained for consumption was in 1786 , 14,626 tons , and on an average of ten years 13,932 tons ; rose to an average of 25,571 tons in ten years , to 1806.—Goods and Shipping—I come next to the duty which is likely , beyond all comparison , to be attended with the most pernicious and extensive consequences on a return of peace to our revenue , navigation , commerce , and manufactures . The effects which must inevitably be produced by it that it is utterly inconceiveable to me how they have escaped the noble lord . This is a duty , ( a most productive one now ) of from 1l . to 4l . per cent . on all British , goods and manufactures exported , according to the different parts of the world to which they were sent ( except cotton goods
