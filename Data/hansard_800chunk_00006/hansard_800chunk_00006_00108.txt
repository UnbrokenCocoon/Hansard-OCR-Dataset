, at or before the execution of the treaty , they may have obtained a sovereignty . Let us compare this definition of the uti possidetis , with the two bases agreed upon , either with the one which specifies the determination of contracting upon general grounds for ourselves and allies , or with the more enlarged principle of guaranteeing the security of the lesser states ; and I am sure , that , from such a comparison , there is nothing in the annals of diplomacy , to justify , from such a construction of the bases of a negociation , by the most tortured perversion which 290 the most ingenious reasoner may adopt , any thing approximating to the principle of actual possession . That his majesty 's ministers were sincere in believing that the uti possidetis was the admitted basis , I most candidly believe , and that it was the design of the French government to encourage that impression , at the same time that it cautiously avoided committing itself to such a compact throughout the entire progress of the correspondence . Indeed , the conduct of his majesty 's government has proved it to be a government seeking peace , in the spirit of peace ; whilst the contrasted fluctuation of the enemy , shifting and evasive , at one moment giving up one concession , in the next reclaiming the proposition , which it before conceded , clearly exhibits that , from the beginning until the rupture of the negociation , the same perfidy and bad faith were the actuating principle of the French cabinet . But there is one fact , to which I must beg the attention of your lordships , as it is one upon which the declaration of his majesty , the character of his government , and the credit of the country , are at issue with the statement of that man who is at the head of the French empire , and has , in the face of the world , positively denied that the uti possidetis was the basis of the late negociation . This is a circumstance which it behoves his majesty 's ministers fully to explain ; and to convince this house , and all Europe , that what has gone abroad , sanctioned by the name of their sovereign , is the true and justified inference . But the noble baron opposite , has proved , with considerable perspicuity , that the principle of actual possession , is the only principle which could apply to the comparative situation of Great Britain and France , that , from the diversified nature of the various conquests of the respective empires and from the maritime superiority of the one compared with the territorial influence of the other , the only probable basis upon which a treaty honourable to both the contracting parties could be effected , was the basis of the uti possidetis . Having thus proved that the principle of actual possession was the only basis upon which a beneficial treaty could have been concluded , the noble baron has certainly added to the number of the reasons , and enforced the cogency of those arguments , which render it absolutely necessary for ministers to prove to a demonstration , that the principle of the uti possidetis was the actual basis , agreed 291 and acted upon in the late negociation . Really , I know not in what part of the official papers presented to this house , his majesty 's ministers will find this principle of actual possession , once recognized by the French government . Surely not in the letter dated the 5th of March , where an extract from the speech of the chief of that empire states the readiness of the enemy to make peace upon the basis of the Treaty of Amiensâ€”a basis directly contrary to the principle of the uti possidetis ; and a treaty , to which , from the former feelings of the noble baron opposite to me , I am surprized he could have for one moment listened . But , my lords , not only
