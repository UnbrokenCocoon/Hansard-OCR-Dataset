had called for would soon be before the house , and then the noble lord might proceed in the present session , but now it was merely a question of confidence on the part of the ministers , and submission on the part of the house . He hoped the noble lord would not proceed with this intended plan on the spur of the moment . This improper haste would be attended with great mischief , and in the end prove highly derogatory to the character of parliament . He concluded by moving , that the consideration of his Resolutions should be postponed to that day se'nnight . did not think it necessary to enter upon that part of the noble lord 's speech , which contained his amended statement . He certainly would not object to any day for the consideration of the noble lord 's resolutions , only , he must observe , that they must come under review in discussing the present plan . He wished only to say a few words with respect to the delay solicited by the noble lord . He denied that this was a question of confidence on the one part , and submission on the other . Ministers wished to adopt the plan , not from a vain confidence in themselves , but upon a full and deliberate investigation by parliament . It would be recollected that he had first moved the resolutions two or three weeks ago , that a fortnight was allowed to consider them , that this period ended last Wednesday , and that it was only on that day that the proposal was made for going into the committee . All he asked now was , to vote them in the committee : the report would come up next Wednesday , and they might then be further considered and discussed . They might also be discussed in the different stages of the bill , which it was desirable to carry forward with all reasonable dispatch , that ministers might proceed to the general financial plan .

On the motion for the Speaker 's leaving the chair . rose . The noble lord , he observed , must recollect that he had told the house that various tables were to be distributed , in order to enable that house to acquire a full and complete view of his plan . Gentlemen had had them but for a short time , and he submitted to the noble lord 's candour , whether it was possible even for those who were conversant with subjects of this nature , to make themselves masters of it within a period so limited . It would certainly give more satisfaction if the consideration should be postponed for a few days . However as the house was called upon to discuss the noble lord 's plan , he would now offer the few observations that at present occurred to him . observed , that the right honourable gentleman had better state these in the committee . replied , that he thought it more regular to proceed now , as his objection went rather to the principle of the plan than to the detail . He observed , however , in continuation , that he did not object even to the principle to a certain extent . It might possibly be a fatal error to adhere too pertinaciously to the present plan of taxation , and though he thought that the noble lord 's plan was carried to too great an extent , yet he was fully aware of the difficulties attending his situation . He did not , however , consider the difficulty which the noble lord found last session ,
