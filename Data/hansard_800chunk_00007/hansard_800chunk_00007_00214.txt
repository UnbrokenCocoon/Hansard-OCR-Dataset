of Buonaparte , who nominated the bishop , and he the priest . There was at this moment an army in Ireland in the pay of Buonaparte . Gentlemen talked of conciliating the higher 325 orders of the Roman Catholics . Who were the higher orders ? He knew not where to find them . He was sure there were not forty Roman Catholic gentlemen in Ireland of 1000l . a year each . In order to make those concessions to the Roman Catholics of Ireland , which were intended to be given by the late bill , there must be a repeal of the Test act , and of any other acts against the Catholics . Yet gentlemen went on to say , that this would not endanger the established church . What had already been the consequence ? When the account of this bill arrived in Ireland , the Roman Catholics called a public meeting ; and a Mr. Keogh laughed to scorn the whole of the measure , as not containing enough of concession ; and in menacing terms , declared they would have all , or none . If the powers given to lord Cornwallis , to lord Hardwicke , and to the duke of Bedford he believed also , were continued , and proper powers by them delegated to the magistrates , he would engage there would be no rebellion , in Ireland . There had been menaces of rebellion , but there would be none . The lower orders of the Roman Catholics who had been guilty of disturbances , had neither leaders . arms , nor property . He knew them well . He had lived all his life in Ireland ; and had been in every part of it . If a French army were landed in Ireland , he believed they would join it , to a man .

He understood him to say , that a noble lord , a privy counsellor to his majesty , had attempted to subvert the Protestant religion .
