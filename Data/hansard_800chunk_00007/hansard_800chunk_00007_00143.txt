other concerns in which he was at that time engaged , travelled over a great part of the kingdom , for the purpose of collecting further information on the subject , the different Postmasters having previously received orders from the treasury to answer his inquiries ; and that , during the petitioner 's absence , the administration was changed , but the new administration being equally desirous of encouraging and effecting the plan , sent the outline to the general post Office for inspection , and it was returned with voluminous objections from the superior officers , who asserted , that the post office establishment had , after the fullest consideration and every possible exertion , been brought to the most perfect state of improvement , not only as to expedition and safety , but in the interior departments , and that any attempt to alter it would be ruinous to the correspondence and commerce of the country , and if any ignorant projector were suffered to interfere for such a purpose , he ought to be made responsible , as far as might be , for the consequences ; and that , although some of these objections appeared well founded , it was evident that others arose from prejudice and self-interest ; but the petitioner was directed to answer them in detail , which he had scarcely done . before the administration was again changed ; and Mr. Pitt , on his return to office , received further decided objections from the post office , which were followed up by such a determined opposition and outcry against the plan as to create a combination amongst the inn keepers and coach-masters on the roads , and by rendering them unwilling to convey the mails on the terms proposed threatened to destroy the whole of the arrangements made by the petitioner preparatory to the trial ; this , together with the complicated nature and construction of the posts , which his plan would totally disarrange , and which he must of course completely new 222 model , gave full employment to his mind , and cause for serious reflection and anxiety ; and that the petitioner had first taken up the idea of reform as a very simple one , and easy to be accomplished , but as he was imperceptibly led on in the pursuit of his favourite object , the new and accumulated dangers and obstacles which opened upon him at every step , together with the inveterate opposition he experienced from the General Post Office , from which he had been led to expect by government every assistance , convinced him that he had involved himself in almost inextricable difficulties ; it had completely possessed his mind , and he had pursued it through different changes of administration for above two years ; he had , incurred great expence ; the various concerns he had been engaged in had been neglected to his great loss , and he found that he had no alternative now left , but either to abandon the plan , to return to safety , and dedicate his future life to the recovery and improvement of his various private concerns , or to make the sacrifice of abandoning those altogether , and adhere to his plan , and to the chance of acquiring a great fortune for himself and family by its success , as Mr. Allen had done before him by his improvements of the posts ; he submitted therefore these circumstances and his situation to Mr.Pitt , and the necessity of immediately settling the terms which were to determine his choice , and that to the justice of this the minister directly assented , and assured the petitioner , that if he would give in his proposals for compensation so that the promised advantages could but be secured , and the agreement be made fair and safe for the public , whatever fortune the petitioner might derive from it , there would be no hesitation on his part to close with it , and to satisfy his mind as to his future prospects ; and that , in consequence of this assurance
