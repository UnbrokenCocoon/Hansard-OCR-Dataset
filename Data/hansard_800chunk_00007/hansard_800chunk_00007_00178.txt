of a conviction that the measure had been introduced under a misunderstanding into this house , could have induced me to make ; a sacrifice dictated only by a desire of doing what , under circumstances of such embarrassment , we conceived , after the most anxious deliberation , to be most consistent with our respect to our sovereign , and with the obligations imposed on us in the double capacity of members of the administration and of the legislature . In this situation we determined to make a sacrifice , which in any case where personal feelings and public duties come in competition with each other , I hope I shall never hesitate to make . It was , however , I repeat , a great and painful sacrifice ; and in making it , it was necessary that we should take care not to place ourselves in a situation in which we might be made incapable of rendering hereafter any useful service to the public . The circumstances which occurred rendered the measures to be taken , with a view to the future security and peace of Ireland , a consideration of greater delicacy and difficulty than ever . Our public duty and our private honour made it indispensable that we should be free and unfettered on this point of our necessary deliberations . Circumstances had occurred in an early period of these transactions , and had been more strongly manifested during this latter period of the discussion , which implied a restriction on this important subject ; and we found it necessary not only to reserve to ourselves the power of explaining to parliament our conduct with respect to the bill we had consented to withdraw ; and of declaring in parliament individually the opinions which we hold with respect to the catholic claims , in the possible event of a discussion of their petition ; but also to state it as essential to our own characters , as 273 well as to the public interest , that the deference which we had felt it our duty to shew , on this occasion , to the opinions and feelings expressed by his majesty , should not be understood as restraining us from submitting , from time to time , as it was our duty , for his Majesty 's decision , such measures respecting that part of the united kingdom , as the course of circumstances should appear to require ; accompanied with an humble assurance , that in discharging that and every other part of our duty , so long as his majesty should think fit to honour us with his confidence , nothing should be omitted on our part , which could best testify our invariable and respectful attachment to his majesty , and our sincere and anxious concern for his majesty 's personal ease and comfort , and for the prosperity and honour of his majesty 's government . This part of our proceeding has been most improperly misrepresented to the public . It has been stated in that mutilated publication to which 1 have already alluded as if we had reserved to ourselves the power of bringing this particular measure again before parliament ; and the important words `` for your majesty 's decision , '' as well as the concluding paragraphs , are in that extract omitted , purposely to give a false colour to the proceeding . Not only was the respectful statement which we made in writing to his majesty , accompanied with our declaration of our sincere and anxious desire to consult , on all occasions , his majesty 's personal ease and comfort ; but it was distinctly stated personally , both by my lord Grenville and myself , that it would be our constant wish and endeavour to keep from him , as much as possible , all subjects which might be distressing to his mind . I appeal then with confidence to the house , on the purity of the motives by which we were actuated , on the deference and respect shewn , to the utmost limit of our public duty , to his majesty
