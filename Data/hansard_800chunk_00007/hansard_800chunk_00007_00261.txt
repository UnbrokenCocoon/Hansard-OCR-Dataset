measure ; but it appeared to him that there was no alternative but to repeal the Irish act , or to go the length proposed ; and it was upon this ground , and to the extent of this act only , that his concurrence had been given.—The dispatch was sent to the king at Windsor on the evening of the 9th , and returned on the following day with a note expressing his majesty 's disapprobation of the measure which had been recommended ; and `` the hope he had entertained that the subject would not again have been agitated . '' In the evening of the 10th , another cabinet meeting was held ; at which a minute was prepared , describing in terms the most respectful , the precise ground on which his majesty 's servants deemed it incumbent 393 upon them to solicit his majesty 's permission to propose to parliament a clause , to the effect before stated , to be inserted in the mutiny bill , then pending in the house of commons ; with ut adverting , however , to the expediency of repealing the exceptions in the Irish act , or of extending the measure to the naval service . To this minute of cabinet , which was communicated to his majesty , not by himself ( lord S. ) , as had been erroneously supposed , but by the secretary of state , no answer was returned the next day ; but a council being then held at the Queen 's palace , he had previously to it , at an audience on the business of his office been questioned by his majesty on this subject ; when he informed his majesty , that he had been induced to concur in the proposed measure , as a necessary consequence of the Irish act of 1793 , from the consideration of which , combined with the act of Union it appeared to him that there was no alternative but the repeal of the Irish act , or the adoption of this measure .

Whilst , however , the king so far reluctantly conceded , he thought it necessary to declare that he could not go one step further . `` —Hence it appeared evident , that his majesty conceived the proposition to be grounded entirely on the act of 1793 ; and to have no other object than that of extending its operation to Great Britain . This , as he had before stated , was the light in which it had been regarded , not only by himself , but by other members of the cabinet . By the lord chancellor it had been described to his majesty on the 11th of February , as nothing more than a corollary from that act ; and in this view of it , lord Howick , on a subsequent day ( Feb. 20 ) , 394 gave notice to the house of commons , of his intention to propose some additional clauses in the mutiny bill . In that light it was so far understood by Mr. Elliott , the secretary to the lord lieutenant , that he made his communication to the Catholics accordingly , and referred to the government at home a question which
