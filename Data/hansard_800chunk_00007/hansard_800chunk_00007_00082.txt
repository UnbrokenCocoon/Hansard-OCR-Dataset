hesitation and repentance , to lose the merit of their former concessions ? Had they not better , even if they object not to this bill , lay hold of the laws which have hitherto protected them , and demand compensation at least , as the condition of their passive concurrence ? they will soon find themselves undistinguished from us who have from the first withstood these innovations—undistinguished , excepting by the bitter consciousness of having been aiding and consenting to their own destruction ; and they must be contented with us to walk through the empire with a brand upon their backs ; if they enjoy a short prosperity , it will be a prosperity blasted by obloquy and reproach ; if they fall , on the contrary , as I believe they will , they will fall unpitied and unprotected.—Sir , if in what I have said I have expressed myself at any time with un- 132 becoming warmth , I shall to-morrow be sorry for it ; the house will , I trust , regard it as the effort of an expiring flame , the spasm before dissolution . Believing , as in sincerity and sobriety I do , that if this bill pass , it condemns the colonies to a decay more or less rapid , I could not bring myself to say less in justification of the opposition I have given , and must continue to give to it ; but , sir , I have done , and can not foresee that I shall again at any time have to trouble the house on this subject , unless it chance that on the one hand consequences I do not now look for should demand from me retraction or concessions , which shall , in that case , be freely made before they are called for , or that I should , on the other hand , be compelled to submit to the house cases of individual distress and injury originating in this bill , and humbly praying for compensation ; should this last , sir , be my let , and should even the worst I have contemplated come to pass , I shall not think that the language of reproach will avail any thing under such circumstances , neither will I ( and for this the hon . gent , whom I oppose ought to thank me ) at that time undertake their defence and justification . I will not say that I knew many of these abolitionists who , with the exception of their prejudices on this subject , were much like other men ; and that , had I been , as , thank God I was not , like them , misled by delusive theories , deceived by false , exaggerated , or partial accounts of what has passed , and is passing in Africa and the West Indies ; instigated by popular clamour ( itself artificially and enthusiastically excited ) ; and fascinated by oratory , I might with them , have given my voice for a measure which has proved destructive of its object , and has sacrificed one main source of our national prosperity . had never said , that the persons engaged in the slave trade were out of the protection of the law .

He had asserted that , on general principles , them could be no claim for losses sustained by a transaction which the house had declared to be contrary to justice , humanity , and policy ; and he still adhered to that opinion .
