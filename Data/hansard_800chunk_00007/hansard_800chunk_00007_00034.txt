Indies had been the support of the country for many years , both as to seamen and revenue . We might as well say , Oh , we will not have our chimney swept , because it is a little troublesome to the boy , as that we should give up the benefit of the West Indies on account of the supposed hardships of the negro . vindicated the character of the planters for humanity ; but supported the bill most strenuously , on the ground that there was a most shameful abuse of the authority delegated by them . observed . that if the mea- 61 sure of French iniquity was not yet full , we should surrender up to them this guilty trade , that we might acquit ourselves of any further charge as to this heinous offence ; whilst it might complete the catalogue of our enemies ' crimes , we , at the same time , might hope to have taken one great step towards averting the wrath of Heaven from us . supported the amendment ; but at the same time recommended that a parliamentary commission should be sent out to every island in the West Indies , and that parliament might afterwards lay very high duties on the importation of slaves into every island where the traffic was found to be still carried on . thought it would be a most tedious and impotent measure to wait until we had the report of as many of the commissioners as might chance to reach home with the report , and then leave the measure in a great degree to the discretion of the governors of the different islands . But there was one point which he thought to be particularly worthy of notice ; the council for the planters had acknowledged at the bar of the house of lords , that it was intended to have several new pieces of land cultivated , for which a fresh supply of slaves was wanted ; and there was another point to which he thought it necessary to advert ; did the gallant admiral opposite suppose that we , as christians , could hope , when visited by the wrath of Heaven , as he had stated , with a hurricane , could we then hope for a blessing from the Almighty by setting off to Africa to rob and murder in order to recruit our stock ? entered into a detail of the various proceedings of parliament , and the opinion of the most eminent public men for a century past as to this trade .
