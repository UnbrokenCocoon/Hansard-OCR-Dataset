part of the kingdom ; and , with respect to Ireland , it could not be seriously contended that of late years , to say the least , such a spirit had appeared to actuate the government of that part of his majesty 's dominions . No one would impute it to the administration of the duke of Bedford : that of lord Hardwicke was a subject of general and unqualified panegyric : and he would ever contend , that whatever instances of violence and cruelty might have occurred during the disastrous period of the rebellion , they were in no degree imputable to the system of government either in Ireland , or at home . Without recurring to an earlier period , he would only add , that in the year 1793 , the measures adopted towards the Catholics in Ireland had not only been marked by a spirit of toleration and liberality which he admired and applauded , but by a prodigality of concession , which broke down the constitutional barrier between Catholics and Protestants , and made it , as he admitted , very difficult to take a distinction in point of principle , between what had been granted and what was withheld . For himself , who thought that too much had been granted , it was competent to say , that he would not consent to grant more . He was convinced that concession beyond the point at which it had long since arrived , instead of being the cure , was and would be a fresh cause of discontent ; that , to preserve the tranquillity of Ireland , it was necessary to act on a firm , steady , and at the same time temperate system : to abstain from raising hopes , which could neither be realized , nor disappointed , without public inconvenience and danger ; but , at the same time to let the Catholics feel , that , 402 though , an increased portion of political power was withheld from them from considerations of policy and expediency , they are in other respects precisely on the same footing as all other classes and descriptions of his majesty 's subjects , entitled to equal favour and equal protection.—This was the system upon which Ireland was governed in the time of lord Hardwicke , ( a system congenial to that which , at the same period , was adopted in England ) ; and , as he had the happiness of thinking , with general satisfaction and success . In Ireland , whilst it animated the zeal of the loyal , it had also the effect , in many instances , of calming the turbulent , and of silencing , if not of reclaiming , the disaffected . During lord Hardwicke 's administration , there was no agitation in Ireland on the ground of catholic claims , and it was a well known fact , that Emmett , whose desperate project was occasioned by other causes , declared , a short time before his execution , that such was the impression generally produced by the lenity and liberality of the government , that , if he had delayed his attempt only for a few weeks , it would have met with so little support as not to afford any chance whatever of success . It did not , therefore , appear to him , that , for the purpose of tranquillizing the minds of Catholics , it was necessary to agree to this motion . That object could alone be obtained by a wise , and temperate system of government ; by firmness without rigour , and by conciliation without concession.—He then stated , that the intent of the motion of the noble marquis was evidently to censure the dismission of his majesty 's late ministers , and the practical tendency of it to raise the credit of the former government at the expence of the present , so as to effect the removal of the one , and the reinstatement of the other . From the motion abstractedly taken , he could not dissent ; but he disapproved of its
