, was , by the declaration of his majesty 's late ministers , to be submitted to his majesty . An hon . gent . on the other side , however , had put a hypothetical case , and supposed that another king James might happen to ascend the throne , who would make this measure the means of subverting the Protestant establishment in this country . To this he answered , that if such a king were to ascend the throne , it would then become the duty of ministers to give manly , constitutional advice , however it might be repugnant to the feeling of the then king . But , if it were once admitted as a principle , that a king had a right to demand of his ministers a pledge , that they would not again trouble him with any advice connected with that subject , then truly would the Protestant establishment be in danger . For his own part , although he believed that the motion of his hon . friend would be carried that night by a majority , he did not believe that , had the Catholic bill been persevered in , the influence of the late government exerted at that time could have secured its adoption.—The question being loudly called for , the house divided on the amendment to the original motion , namely , that the other orders of the day be now read . While the opposition members were in the lobby , lord Howick requested their attention : he stated that there were two motions before the house , the first , that the 348 other orders of the day be now read , upon which they were then dividing , and upon which it was pretty certain they should be in a majority ; the second would be upon the original motion . Should they , as he trusted they would , negative the first , and carry the original question , it would then be perhaps necessary to propose an address to the throne , to meet the threat which had been thrown out that evening—a threat unexampled in the annals of parliament.—The result of the division was , For Mr. Osborn 's amendment 258 For the original motion 226 –– Majority for Ministers 32 List of the Minority .
