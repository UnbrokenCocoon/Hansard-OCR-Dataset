; but as they refused to do so , they were virtually their own dismissers . His majesty , sir , in the whole of this proceeding has displayed the greatest forbearance , endeavouring by every means in his power to obviate the necessity of removing his late ministers ; and he did not 299 resort to that extremity , until they made it quite impossible for him to act otherwise , consistently with any regard for his constitutional duty . When I come to consider sir , the conduct of his majesty 's late ministers since their removal from office , it does indeed astonish me more than I can express . This attempt , direct or indirect does not signify , it is equally an attempt . Therefore , sir , I repeat , this attempt to resist the indisputable right of the crown , this disclosure to parliament of what till now was ever considered as confined within the insurmountable limits of inviolable secrecy , this arraigning , as it were , the sovereign at the bar of parliament , to account for his constitutional exercise of the royal prerogative , is , in my mind , as reprehensible a proceeding as has occurred in this country since the Revolution ; and I must say , sir , that it meets with my most unqualified condemnation . Having now , sir , discussed this most important subject with as much accuracy as my humble abilities , and total want of experience in parliament , will admit of my doing , and I am afraid quite tired the patience of the house , I must express my decided opinion , that his majesty 's late ministers have not adhered so strictly to the principles which I premised , as I think they ought to have done ; and though I may lament , which I sincerely do , the necessity that I am under of disapproving their conduct in this respect , as well as in many other particulars immediately connected with their late proceedings , still , sir , however repugnant it may be to my feelings to differ from those , for many of whom I have long entertained the most unfeigned esteem , and it is extremely painful , my duty is with me paramount to every other consideration , and were I to neglect the performance of it , I should forfeit that self-approbation which I value above every earthly good . In taking the part that I do , sir , I feel that I am conscientiously discharging my duty as a member of parliament . I feel that I am actuated by a just sense of what I owe of patriotism to my country , and of loyalty to my king , without the one being diminished , or the other unconstitutionally exaggerated by that extreme personal attachment which I have ever borne to the most benign , the most paternal , the best , the most patriotic of sovereigns . I feel , sir , that I am standing forward in defence of the due constitutional exercise of the prerogative of the crown against an attempted invasion , which 300 if it were to Prevail , might ultimately cause our government to degenerate into a tyrannical oligarchy , or a factious democracy , and we might then bid adieu to that blessed constitution , the glory of England , and admiration of the world ; we might then bid adieu to that enviable political existence , which is the honest pride , and forms the foundation of the conscious superiority of every Briton ; we might then bid adieu to that invaluable inheritance handed down to us by such ancestors as no other people have to boast of ; and we might soon be fettered by the galling despotism or tossed in the boisterous whirlwind of democratic fury . I trust , sir , that we shall avert such horrid evils , and that we shall prove by the vote of this night , that we consider the crown as now standing forward , in the most paternal , and most
