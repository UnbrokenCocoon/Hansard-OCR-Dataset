( lord Melville , ) as were by their violence and injustice a disgrace to the Journals of the house . He regretted sincerely the dismissal of the late administration , and particularly as they were succeeded by men who from their conduct in abandoning the government on the death of Mr. Pitt , from acknowledged incapacity to conduct it , left that on record which furnished an evidence of their present presumption.—The question being then loudly called for , a division took place : when there appeared for the address 208 ; against it 115 ; majority 220 93 . While the supporters of the address were in the lobby , order was called , and lord Howick addressed them as follows : —Gentlemen ; I understand , that it is intended to propose to morrow , that the house should at its rising adjourn for a much longer time than is usual at this period of the session , or than I think consistent with the present state of affairs , or with my views of the public interest . The adjournment which is to be proposed is to next Monday fortnight . It is my intention , on the grounds I have mentioned , to oppose that motion , and to propose by way of amendment , unless , as I hope , it may be proposed by somebody else , that no longer adjournment should take place than till Monday se'nnight at farthest .
