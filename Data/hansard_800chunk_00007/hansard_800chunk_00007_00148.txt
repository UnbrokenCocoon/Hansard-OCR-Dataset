as he invariably had done , that he should consider himself extremely ill treated if he was paid in any degree short of his actual agreement ; that Mr. Pitt had a right , if he thought proper , and as might suit his political convenience , to dispense with his services , but he could not in justice dispense with the engagements he had entered into with the petitioner ; and that , in December 1794 , after the usual period had elapsed of making up the annual accounts at the General Post Offices , the petitioner sent a memorial to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury , stating his agreement , and requiring Post Offices accounts to April 1794 , and the payment of the balance of salary and per centage due to him beyond the sum he had been paid ( of £3000 ) . In August , 1795 , after various applications and waiting eight months , he received an answer , stat 229 ing , that their lordships were of opinion that the sum of £3000 per annum for his life was a just and full compensation for the services he had rendered , and that they did not think themselves justified on the part of the public to make any addition to that allowance ; and that , in January 1796 , ( being shortly after the next meeting of parliament ) the petitioner having advised with his counsel in the further steps necessary to be taken in this harrassing business , presented to the Board of Treasury a remonstrance to their answer , and proposed , that if their lordships conceived themselves unable to perform the agreement made with him , an application might be made to parliament on the subject , when the agreement , as well as his merits and his conduct , might be fully investigated ; and that although an answer was promised in time for the petitioner to make such appeal , he did not receive it till the dissolution of parliament was determined on , and he had to wait the meeting of the new one in the following year , when a committee of the house was appointed `` To consider of the agreements made with the petitioner for the reform and improvement of the Post Office and its revenue , and to inquire into the causes of his suspension , and report to the house the evidence received ; '' and that , in May 1797 , the committee , after being occupied above five weeks on the subject , reported to the house the evidence received , which was ordered to be printed , and fully proved the agreement made with the petitioner as before stated.— Ordered to lie upon the table . called the attention of the house to a practice , which , from a sense of duty , he had so often pursued , in bringing forward , for the information of parliament , such annual accounts as were connected with any office that he had happened to fill . He was more especially induced to this , as he had resigned a few days ago the presidency of the committee of council for trade , an office of great importance and responsibility , which no prudent man would undertake or hold , unless he felt that he could have the confidence and co-operation of a strong and enlightened government . He was proud to believe that he had possessed the unreserved confidence of a government entitled to those epithets . The efficient offices of that government had been filled 230 by individuals of eminent talents , well suited to their respective departments . They had been aided in their councils by colleagues equally distinguished . They had stood high in the opinion of parliament , ant in the esteem and respect of foreign countries . In closing this description he felt a want of language to express what was due to the character of his honourable friend ( lord Grenville ) ; to the integrity , wisdom , and energy , of his mind ; to his indefatigable zeal in
