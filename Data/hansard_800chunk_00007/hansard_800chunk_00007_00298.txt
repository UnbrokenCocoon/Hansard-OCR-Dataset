policy , would do well to consider what chance there would have been of accomplishing it under the present administration , which contains almost every individual ( with very few exceptions ) connected with public life , by whom it was always opposed , and treated as a chimerical 448 and pernicious speculation.—During the same government of 13 months , a plan was brought forward , and almost accomplished , for the better administration of justice in Scotland . No impartial person who has been in that country , and who is aware of the daily increasing inconveniences both to the judges and the suitors , arising from the present form of the courts , can hesitate as to the necessity of some change ; yet no former government ever had the diligence , the wisdom , or the courage to attempt what became an immediate object of attention to the late ministers.—With regard to the persons by whom they have been succeeded , I am not desirous to state my sentiments much in detail , both because a good deal has been said already , and because it is a pleasanter task to praise than to blame . I can not however avoid declaring , that whether I look at the means by which they have acquired power , or the means by which they must retain it , if they retain it at all , I consider their administration as the greatest calamity that has befallen the country since the breaking up of lord Chatham 's ministry , in 1763—a transaction which this resembles in some of its most striking features , and particularly as being the result of that secret influence , of which that great man never ceased to complain , and which deprived us of his services at the highest point of his usefulness and reputation , and cut him short in the full career of his own , and of England 's glory.—The house has been already reminded that these are the gentlemen who were seized with a sudden panic , and abandoned the government , almost immediately upon the death of Mr. Pitt , whose illustrious name was justly considered as forming the only ornament and support of their administration . It must be confessed , however , to their credit , that in their retreat they complied most honourably with the rules of ancient war ; they did not suffer the `` spolia opima '' of the departed hero to fall into the hands of the enemy . His faithful myrmidons kept the field till they had fairly taken possession of his sinecure , and then retired . They have however sprung upon us again from a sort of ambush , and regained possession of their former position . They have accomplished this , by means of a successful appeal to a particular opinion entertained by his majesty , an opinion with which many of them are known so little to agree , that they thought it necessary upon a former occasion , to give up their places , because they 449 could not carry a measure in direct opposition to it . And there is this remarkable difference between their case and the case of the late ministers , that they demanded the whole of what is called `` Catholic emancipation , '' and refused to serve the king any longer because he would not grant it , whilst the late ministers asked only a part of that measure , a very small part , and one that had been already promised by their predecessors , and what is still more important , were content to abandon that part to the wishes of their sovereign.—Sir , the present government owe their power to a dark intrigue , and not to any general opinion in their favour ; and they must retain it by those means which are always resorted to , in order to supply the want of pubic confidence . Among these , I understand we may reckon a profose distribution of honours , which , without any proportionate advantage to the popular part of the constitution , degrades the
