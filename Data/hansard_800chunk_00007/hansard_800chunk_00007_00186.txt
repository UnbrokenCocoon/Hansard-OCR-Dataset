persons committed under such circumstances as those in which the petitioner stood , solicited from that house an exercise of its benevolence in their favour , by ordering their liberation , that they should at least confess the crime for which they stood committed , thereby acknowledging the justice of the sentence , and expressing their contrition , But the petition just now read contained no such acknowledgment—The petition was allowed to remain on the table , without any further observation . for the purpose of bringing forward his promised motion , and addressed the house as follows : —I rise , sir , to submit to the house a few observations on a subject of great national importance , and involving in it questions of the most serious constitutional consideration . And in doing so , sir , I can not help expressing my sincere regret that a duty of such moment had not devolved upon some member more competent to discharge it than the humble individual who in his zeal for the constitution , was heedless of the difficulties his inferiority must in such an undertaking have to contend against . But , sir , however inadequate I may prove , I have to conjure the house not to attribute the feebleness of the advocate to the weakness of the cause , but rather be disposed to conclude that , as a becoming sense of the greatness of the question and of the tribunal fills me with dismay , so should the indulgence of this house contribute to remove it . Sir , I could have wished to have staid those foul calumnies that presumed with equal ignorance and malice to prejudge and to condemn the motives that influenced the conduct of his majesty 's late servants , so far as that conduct related to the unfortunate misunderstanding that led to their dismissal ; and this , sir , not upon the principle of preferring any one ministry , or of adhering to any one party , but upon the great and unshaken conviction , that the unrestricted pro- 285 pagation of such slanders , however gross or false , tend in an alarming degree to vitiate the public mind , and thus to assail political integrity in its very source ; for they have but empty notions of our greatness as a people , who do not understand that public virtue is national security . I repeat , therefore , sir , that I wish such slanders had been staid , at least until the ingenuous , manly , and luminous statement of the noble lord ( Howick ) had gone abroad , and rendered them contemptible and harmless . Sir , that statement enabled me to form a clear and satisfactory opinion of the conduct of the late ministers , immediately previous to their departure from power ; and , as I consider the question upon that part of their conduct as involving great constitutional principles , I have foregone my original intention of going at large into the general merits of their administration ; and shall confine myself to a brief consideration of that conduct which has been the subject of so much discussion and to the principles by which it appears to have been regulated . I presume then , sir , I will not be thought to have stated a very hazardous proposition , when I assert , that if the law has taken responsibility from the executive , it has secured the people by attaching that responsibility to the servants of the crown Independent then of all constitutional considerations , I would ask , is it consistent with common sense or common justice to exact a written pledge restrictive of the free exercise of judgment , from those men who are alone to be responsible ? Is it reasonable to expect that men should pledge themselves to act contrary to the dictates of their own judgment , when they only can suffer and be punished for that conduct of which they disapprove ? But sir , when considered in a constitutional point of view , the question is only less absurd ,
