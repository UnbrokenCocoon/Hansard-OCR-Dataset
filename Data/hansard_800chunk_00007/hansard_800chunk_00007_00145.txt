made for its further extension , a draft of the petitioner 's intended appointment was prepared at the Treasury , agreeably to the modified terms , being a grant from his majesty appointing the petitioner surveyor , and comptroller general of the Post Office during his life , with authority to suspend any of the officers and servants belonging thereto , and granting him in consideration of his good and faithful services for the advancement of the revenue , and the advantage of the commerce and manufactures of the kingdom , as well by way of reward of such services , as to encourage him to continue his exertions for furthering the same , a clear salary of £1,500 , together with £2 . 10s . per cent on the increased post revenue , according to the modification before stated ; and that when a draft of this proposed appointment was laid before the then attorney general , he was of opinion that an act of parliament would be requisite to enable the minister to carry the agreement made with the petitioner into execution , as the Post-Office Act of the 9th of Queen Anne merely authorises appointments under the postmaster general , and in consequence of this obstacle the intended grant was suspended till the requisite act could be obtained ; and that during this delay , the petitioner not having sufficient authority vested in him to forward and protect his plan , it got into great irregularity , owing to the neglect of the contractors , who had been induced to believe that he was unsupported by government , and that as the plan had to encounter fresh objections and memorials from the Post Office , it must necessarily be given up ? therefore being disheartened by these apprehensions , as well as by the severity of the winter , and influenced by the advice and threats of those who were adverse to the plan , a combination was entered into , and bonds under heavy penalties executed among , many of the coachmasters as well as postmasters , not only to decline any mail-coach contracts , but to oppose them wherever attempted to be established ; and that in this situation the petitioner found that unless he 225 immediately obtained some official powers , the plan must sink , and all his labour , anxiety , and expence be lost ; and therefore , after representing his apprehensions to the Minister , and consenting to postpone the Completion of his agreement , till the requisite arrangements could be made respecting it , a limited appointment was in August , 1786 , directed to be granted him by the postmaster general , under which he might be enabled to forward his plan , but with an assurance from Mr Pitt , that the full benefit of his agreement should be ultimately secured to him , and he at the same time obtained a warrant for a part of his expences , hot having till then received a shilling either for himself or his numerous agents , although more than four years had elapsed since the commencement of the business , as he was determined to adhere strictly to his proposal , that the plan should be proved efficient and beneficial to the public , before he would accept any remuneration whatever ; and that having obtained this limited appointment , the petitioner without loss of time went into Scotland in order to arrange the posts of that kingdom , and afterwards to Paris for the purpose of establishing a daily packet and post connection between France and this country , so that he was not able to return to London till October , 1787 ; and that early in 1788 he was requested to go to Ire land , in order to settle regulations respecting the establishment of mail-coaches in that kingdom , and likewise for the forming better communications by packets between the northern and southern parts of that country , and the English ports ; and that although the petitioner had during these intervals , in his frequent communications with Mr. Pitt , the most positive
