. These persons being found capable of giving testimony upon such a subject as that , that was the motive , and not any crime committed individually by themselves ; and , therefore , they might with perfect safety , and with perfect truth , answer the questions put , and yet that makes no difference as to the probability of the inducements which were addressed to them , not for their own security , but for the security of those who might be hurt by the testimony they were hereafter to give.—Upon this part of the case , as well as upon other parts , undoubtedly the cause which I have to support labours under considerable disadvantage ; because I am under the necessity of considering it in this stage of the business , abridged as it must of necessity be , and excluding from the consideration much of the testimony which would be confirmatory of the account thus given ; because , with great propriety , the house have confined the enquiry to the endeavouring to remove out of the way written or parole testimony , without entering into the merits of any thing Which passed in the election . You have , therefore , very properly stopped us from going into evidence of the actual practices and the transactions during the election , or of the knowledge of these persons of the contents of that important document on which I shall presently observe . You have necessarily excluded , therefore , all that collateral testimony and account which might be given on that part of the case , and which would confirm or refute all the account thus given of the attempts to keep these witnesses out of the way.—The materiality of their testimony ; the importance of it ; the nature of it ; you are all unable Particularly and distinctly to , know ; because , of necessity , the case must be deprived of any consideration of that part of the subject ; and I forbear to state any part of that on which you can not receive evidence .

The opportunity of presenting to a proper tribunal that testimony , and surely , at the same moment you exclude the materiality of that testimony , and prevent its being properly examined , it will not be said it is very incredible , that such an attempt should be made , and much less that it is impossible , because the witnesses would not have been credited or can not prove that which is material . We had a right to have their testimony heard ; we had a right to have these witnesses forthcoming ; we had a right to keep them untainted , and not visited by the opponent patty at the time they knew they were under orders-to attend on the future tribunal to hear the merits of the case . Therefore , undoubtedly , the conduct of these persons , the solicitor of the sitting member and of Mr. Wallis and Mr. Gallant all employed under him ; beginning in the month of Feb. holding out the expectation of the postponement and laying hold of them—to address this , argument ( whether well or ill founded ) was undoubtedly , I should submit , a species of conduct which would receive no sanction or authority from this house.—Sir , in addition to that , you hear that in the early part of the month of Feb. , namely , on the 10th of that month , soon after the solicitor and the persons employed under him had been thus work with the several witnesses—you find , what I am sorry to be under the painful necessity of stating and
