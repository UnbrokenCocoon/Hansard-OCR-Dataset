, and is now , depending in Parliament , for enabling his majesty to avail himself of the services of all his liege subjects in his naval and military forces , in the manner therein mentioned ; and the petitioners feel it their duty to express their serious apprehensions of the dangers likely to arise from the said bill if carried into a law ; and they conceive this measure to afford a most formidable precedent of departing , in a leading and important instance , from the principles of our constitution in church and state , as asserted in the ever-memorable Bill of Rights , 283 the basis of our laws and liberties ; and that the oaths and declarations provided in that bill , and preceding and subsequent acts of parliament , are not more than sufficient for the preservation of the church establishment against the attempts of those , whose principles ever have been , and ever must remain , in direct hostility to it ; and that the petitioners , instructed by all experience , apprehend that those who have ever abused power when they have possessed it , to the purposes of founding their own dominion on the destruction of the civil and religious liberties of mankind , and the true principles of Christian toleration , would be inclined , if circumstances permitted , to pursue the same conduct ; and that placing military trusts and commands in the hands of persons so disposed , would enable them to extort any other concession they might be induced to demand , and furnish them with a powerful instrument to carry on their projects with effect , to the utter ruin of our happy constitution in church and state , which must stand or fall together ; and therefore praying , that the above-mentioned bill may not pans into a law , and that the house , in its wisdom , will be pleased to maintain and preserve inviolate those laws , which experience has proved to be the best safeguards of our national happiness and security , and under Divine Providence , the firmest support of the title of our beloved monarch and his august family to the throne of this united kingdom . `` —Ordered to lie upon the table.— —Lord Folkestone presented a petition from Wm .
