had been put to him at a meeting at Dublin , whether it was intended to repeal `` the limitations of the act of 1793 , and render Catholics capable of holding the situations of commander-in-chief , master-general of the ordnance , and of generals on the staff ? `` —It must also be observed , that the dispatch , according to the terms in which it was conceived , was , strictly speaking , applicable to no other than this limited construction . It proposed to give to the Catholics a competency to `` hold any military commission whatever : '' but military offices , excepted by the act of 1793 , are not understood as being held under military commissions : and it is remarkable , that , in the clauses which it was intended to insert in the mutiny bill , the words , `` or appointments '' were added to the word `` commissions , '' as being apparently necessary to repeal the limitations of the Irish act : and so strongly was the supposed import of these words impressed on the minds of some most intelligent members of the other house of parliament , that , for the purpose of giving effect to their opinion of the expediency of confining the measure to the Irish act , they had intended to propose that the additional words `` or appointments '' should be omitted ; which alteration would have rendered the clauses not only conformable to their wishes , but to the terms of the dispatch of the 9th of February , as well as to what he had conceived to be the true construction of it . It therefore appears , that the dispatch itself , as well as the reasoning upon which it was recommended , was not calculated to impart to his majesty 's mind a knowledge of the extensive import which it was actually intended to convey : and that it was not only not extraordinary that it should have been understood by his majesty in a limited sense , but that it would be justly a matter of surprise if it could have been viewed in any other light.—Lord Sidmouth then proceeded to state what had occurred after he had learnt that the measure was designed to be carried beyond the provisions of the Irish act . His own objections were immediately stated to the noble lord at the head of the government , accom- 395 panied by a declaration , which was frequently repeated on subsequent occasions , of the necessity under which he should feel himself of opposing the extension in parliament . A few days afterwards , upon being informed by the judge-advocate-general , that he had been directed to prepare clauses , to be inserted in the mutiny bill , which would have the effect of repealing the limitations in the Irish act , he went to the Foreign office , the noble baron ( lord Grenville ) being out of town , and expressed to lord Howick his own sentiments respecting the measure , and his conviction that the extent of it was not understood by the king ; and he owed it to that noble lord to declare , that he manifested the utmost anxiety , that means should be taken to prevent or obviate any misapprehension on the part of his majesty , before the measure was submitted to parliament . On the return of the noble baron ( Grenville ) , he made a similar communication to his lordship ; and on the 1st of March , this subject was discussed in cabinet.—At that meeting , he ( lord S. ) declared his persuasion , founded on his majesty 's language to himself on the 11th of February , and on his majesty 's answer to the minute of cabinet on the 12th , that his majesty was not aware of the extent of the proposed measure , and likewise expressed his own sense of the indispensable necessity of putting an end to all doubts on a point of so much delicacy and importance . The noble baron , however , then stated
