That , from this cause , your petitioner has suffered most grievous injustice , indignity , and injury ; that , after a life of faithful , zealous , and arduous services , be has been driven , as above shown , to the alternative of abandoning his profession and his means of subsistence , or of retaining them accompanied with unmerited disgrace ; and , that he , therefore , prays your honourable house , the constitutional protectors of the people 's liberties arid properties against arbitrary power and oppression , to afford him redress , and to prevent , by such means as the wisdom of your honourable house it shall seem meet , the future recurrence of similar grievances . And your petitioner shall ever pray . ANDREW COCHRANE JOHNSTONE . London , March 2d , 1807 . `` â€”The petition having been read , Mr. Whitbread moved , that it do lie on the table . observed , that as there was no pledge to bring forward any motion on this petition , he would now take the opportunity of saying a few words , because it had been spread abroad that he had pledged himself to bring this matter before the house . He was glad of this opportunity of giving a public contradiction to that charge .

One of the objects of the petition was to obtain the restoration of his rank . This was a case in which the house could not in the least degree interfere . It was one on which it was impossible to frame any question which could procure the petitioner success . It would be an interference with the prerogative , which the house could not possibly sanction without extreme danger and inconvenience . Another object of the petition was , that the house should take such measures as might prevent the recurrence of such proceedings in future . It was
