favourable to the people—and when I use the 445 word people , I mean to include every thing that is not the creature of court influence and court intrigue.—I am inclined to think , that , according to the doctrines so long and successfully maintained by our ancestors , the proper moment for resignation was that in which his majesty was advised to demand the total abandonment of the Catholic bill , and that they ought not to have waited for the pledge , that last insult which their enemies were already preparing for them in the dark . If such had been their determination , I , for one , should cheerfully have stood by them and been content to abide the consequences . But I am not disposed to urge this point too far : —perhaps there is something in the nature of the times in which we live , and of those deplorable prejudices which it has been the singular effect of the French revolution to revive , by a sort of re-action upon the fears of the tranquil and well-disposed part of society , just at the moment when they were gradually but rapidly falling into utter contempt , which would have rendered this an imprudent step even with a view to the object it was designed to promote , the people it was intended to serve , and to better purposes than a mere continuance in office—perhaps it would have enabled their adversaries to excite against them a foolish and mistaken clamour , the mischiefs of which can be best estimated by those who , like myself , consider their popularity with the great mass of the people , and their ultimate return to power , as the only remaining hope of the friends to religious liberty , to civil freedom , and to the constitution of this country.—And now , sir , to say a few words as to their general conduct : —I regret this change much , because it has deprived the king and the country of a strong , able , and patriotic government—I regret it still more , because it has replaced it by one directly the converse of it in all respects.—I believe , sir , that no government ever did so much for the good of the people in so short a time . Their merits have been stated in detail already , and will probably be stated again by persons far better qualified for the task , both by their authority and talents , than I am . I will however take the liberty of again calling to the mind of the house , those steps towards a reform in the public expenditure which were taken by the noble lord lately at the head of the treasury , and by my noble friend near me . They afford a rare , but brilliant and successful example of a 446 government anxiously and earnestly endeavouring to check abuses , and to save the money of the people , even at the hazard of diminishing their own patronage and power . An hon . gent . ( Mr. Huskisson ) , I perceive , smiles at this assertion ; —I can assure him , however , that I should be perfectly content to put the cause of the late government upon no other ground than the integrity , disinterestedness , and ability they displayed in this instance . I would also remind gentlemen of that plan of finance , ( the work of the same persons , ) on the details I am by no means prepared to give an opinion , but the effect of which , in some most important particulars , are evident to all the world.—After a long period of most expensive war , it has saved us from the necessity of imposing fresh taxes for several years to come , and , I will venture to say , has by that means alone done more than any single act of any former administration to keep up the spirits of the people in this singular and alarming posture of affairs , and to inspire them
