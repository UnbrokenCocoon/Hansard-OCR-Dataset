, the petitioner informed Mr. Pitt , through the present Bishop of Lincoln , his then secretary , that he would undertake the proposed reform at his own risk and expence , on condition that he should be entitled to receive , during his life , two and an half per centum on the future increased revenue of the Post Office beyond the present nett profits , provided his plan succeeded , but not a shilling otherwise ; and that with this proposal the petitioner delivered in a statement of the Post Office revenue , from a very early period , by which it appeared , that , at the expiration of two centuries from its establishment , it had reached only to £150,000 per annum ; and , to mark more strongly the profits he expected to de 223 rive from his plan , as well as the powers necessary to carry it into execution , he likewise gave in a narrative of Mr. Allen 's transactions and agreement with government in 1720 , relative to his farm of the cross posts , which were improved gradually , and at different periods , during upwards of 42 years , till he died ( after the accumulation of a very large fortune , and his having received upwards of £12,000 per annum for many years , as a reward for his services , and during the whole time retained the absolute and independent controul of that branch of the Post Office ) ; and that , in reply to this offer , the petitioner was informed by Mr. Pitt , through his secretary , `` that the proposal was thought fair , and would be fully complied with , provided the plan succeeded ; '' and that the agreement having been thus acceded to , the petitioner proceeded to make his plan more perfect , and prepare for the trial ; and Mr. Pitt , in every conversation previous to such trial , constantly expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the fairness and moderation of the terms , and the benefit to be derived to the public if the plan could but be successfully carried into execution ; and that in the autumn of 1784 , after two years of incessant labour and auxety , the plan was tried on the Western road , and succeeded beyond the promise held out by the petitioner , who had nevertheless afterwards to encounter a renewal of hostilities and impediments from the Post Office , which obliged him to apply for the protection of the Lords of the Treasury , who immediately saw the necessity of their interference , and issued a peremptory order for the purpose ; but the mischief had so far been done , that a considerable delay took place before the trials could be made upon the other roads ; and that Mr. Pitt , being of opinion that the repeated impediments and opposition experienced from the Post Office rendered it absolutely requisite that the petitioner should hold some ostensible official situation , the better to enable him to forward the establishment of his plan , and prevent further obstructions , proposed that he should be appointed surveyor and comptroller general , with a salary of £1,500 per annum , which should be accepted in lieu of per centage on any part of the Post Office revenue within £240,000 , being £90,000 above the amount at that time ; and of course the proposed salary was considerably less than the per centage would have amounted to ; but the petitioner consented to this proposed modification of his original agreement , ra- 224 ther than start obstacles on his part , and particularly as it was intimated that , in case any accident should happen to the petitioner after effecting the plan , but before he had an opportunity of making a suitable provision for his family , there could be no doubt but that government would take such an event into consideration ; and that in the autumn of 1785 , when the plan had been carried into effect on many of the roads in the kingdom , and arrangements
