of the credit of originality ; but surely his noble friend was entitled to the praise of having promptly adopted the suggestion for the advantage of the public , indifferent from whom it might proceed . Would that honourable gentleman , who was himself a member of that committee . [ Here lord Henry Petty suggested to Mr. Sheridan , that the honourable member ( Mr. Johnstone ) was not a member of that committee ; Mr. Sheridan answered loudly , `` I am very glad of it , '' 210 which occasioned a considerable laugh ] . He would ask , then , of that honourable gentleman who was not a member of the committee , and might be therefore more impartial , whether the late ministers were not upon this ground particularly entitled to the acknowledgments of the country ? Did it appear that there had been any shuffling , or any ministerial balloting in the formation of that committee ; was there any obtrusion of minister 's friends ? He appealed to the chairman himself of that committee , to the honourable gentleman ( Mr. Biddulph ) with whom the motion that led to the creation of that committee had originated , if such practices had been resorted to . An allusion had been made to the increase of salary in the office of first lord of the admiralty . The salary was confessed to be shamefully low . A noble lord ( Melville ) whose conduct since had been the subject of such general animadversion , on the same appointment , received , in addition , a considerable salary , levied by the illegal interception of the revenue of Scotland , which salary the noble lord still held though deprived of his place , in virtue of which he originally held it . If , therefore , the charges brought by the honourable gentleman were not to be better founded than those he had already adduced , he ( Mr. Sheridan ) wished that the honourable gentleman would secure to himself the office of charger general against the late administration and all their friends.â€”He desired now to pay some attention to the speech of another hon . gentleman ( Mr. Montague ) who had been pleased to charge gentlemen on his side of the house with deriding his arguments , because they could not answer them ; the hon . gentleman might , however , have had the politeness to wait a little , and try whether they were able to answer him or not , before he made the assertion . The hon . member had saved them the necessity , by offering them no arguments to answer : and as to every thing else , he had so fully answered himself throughout his speech , that it would be superfluous to answer him any farther . Some comparisons had been made between the case now under discussion , and those of lord Ashburton and lord Lechmere ; and some comparisons had also been drawn between the characters and merits of those noble lords , and the right hon . gentleman now the subject of the debate . It was not his province to go into a scrntiny upon merits , and no man more highly esteemed 211 than he did the parliamentary talents of the right hon . gentleman ; and therefore he thought the advice to his majesty , Of placing hint on the opposite bench , was wisely given . He could not enter into a comparison of the number of briefs , fees , and motions which fell to the professional lot of the right hon . gentleman , and which he was to abandon for his new office . But he ( Mr. Sheridan ) , whose lot it was to Vindicate his majesty 's new ministers from the indiscreet zeal of some of their friends , must beg to observe , that they must be strange friends indeed who could advise the right hon . gentleman to give up his certain professional emoluments of 8 or 10,000l . a year , as alledged , to accept a place of
