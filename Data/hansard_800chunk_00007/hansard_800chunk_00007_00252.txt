hereafter have arisen , such as to render the Catholic concessions a measure of indispensable necessity , without which the affairs of the nation could not be carried on , it would have become the duty of ministers to state it to his majesty as a measure without which they could no longer remain in office ; and it is altogether ridiculous to suppose that they would have been precluded from this conduct , because they had on a former occasion relinquished a similar measure , at a time when it was to be considered as expedient and useful , but not of vital importance and absolute necessity . The insertion therefore of these unnecessary reservations might fairly be considered as a threat to renew the subject under circumstances of no greater necessity than the present . This interpretation is confirmed by the expression , that the advice alluded to , was to be submitted from time to time ; an expression which can not easily be limited to those cases of impending destruction to which it is now construed as applying.—Whatever might be the meaning affixed by the council to these expressions , it is certainly no extravagant supposition to imagine that the king may have considered them as a disrespectful defiance , and as such , a sufficient ground for the immediate dismissal of his ministers . This , however , he did 380 not resolve upon , but conveyed to them an expression of his willingness to overlook the conduct , of which he had a right to complain , provided he could be assured that he should not meet the like in future . Such appears to be the obvious spirit and intention of that note from the king , which is described as the demand of a pledge from his ministers . Though in form , that note does demand a pledge , such as ministers could not constitutionally accede to , yet it is to be considered , that this was a paper , dictated on the spur of the moment , and in which we are not to look for the accuracy of a special pleader . The spirit of it is essentially friendly to ministers , and implies a reluctance , on the part of his majesty , to part with them , totally irreconcileable with the idea thrown out by a noble and learned lord , that it must have been dictated by secret advisers , and founded on a previous resolution to dissolve the administration.—It appears , then , that the dismissal of the late ministers may be fairly traced to the circumstances of their personal conduct towards his majesty ; and in this view of the matter , no one will consider it as a proper subject of parliamentary investigation , whether these circumstances were or were not of sufficient weight to induce his majesty to that determination . The noble lords on the opposite side , however , abstracting altogether from those emotions and feelings , from which the royal breast can no more be exempt than those of other men , overlooking all the circumstances , which provoked the ultimate demand of a pledge , consider the subject as a dry and insulated constitutional question . It would have been unconstitutional , they say , for ministers to have given the pledge required , and therefore it was unconstitutional to demand it ; and if this act was not owing to a secret adviser , the new ministers who accept offices , vacated in consequence of that unconstitutional demand , must be held as assuming the responsibility.—The principle , that a new ministry are responsible for the dismissal of their predecessors , and retrospectively for the measures upon which it proceeds , I hold to be sound constitutional doctrine , but the application , which is made of that principle to the present case , appears to me to be fallacious.—That the king can do no wrong , and that he can never act without advice , are principles of constitutional law , which , like many other doctrines of the law of England , are expressed
