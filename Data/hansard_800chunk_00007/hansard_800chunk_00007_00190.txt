which have been long known to exist in the royal mind , with respect to the 290 removal of those disabilities to which the Roman catholics are now subject ; scruples that have the most religious , and I must say , the most constitutional foundation , because they arise from the most sacred doubts , as well as to the admissibility , in a religious sense , of giving such extensive latitude to the coronation oath , as in a political sense , of deviating so widely from the fundamental principles of the constitution , and from doubts too of the expediency of the measure , in immediate relation to the welfare and liberties of the empire in general , for which his majesty has , invariably , during the course of a very long reign , evinced the utmost paternal solicitude . Adverting , I say , to these circumstances , the subject of removing catholic disabilities never , in my opinion , should be brought before his majesty without the most indispensable necessity , an urgency so irresistible as absolutely to involve the safety of the empire . My next observation , sir , is , that in the supposition of such an extreme case , when it might appear quite indispensable to submit the subject to his majesty 's consideration , it behoves those who may then be the advisers of the crown , to take the utmost pains to explain the matter most fully , to place it in all its views , to shew all its bearings and possible consequences , and to provoke such a deliberation upon it in the royal mind , as entirely to obviate the possibility of misconception , to make it clear beyond all possibility of doubt , that the king is completely aware of the full extent of the measure to which his consent is asked ; and afterwards , if any unforeseen circumstances arise , to make an extension of the originally proposed measure necessary , another discussion and explanation equally ample and accurate , and detailed with the first , should be resorted to , in order most carefully to prevent an misunderstanding from this variation From the principles arising out of the observations , I think there can scarcely any dissent , and I shall now proceed examine how far his majesty 's late ministers have been governed by them , strictly as I think they ought to have bee His majesty 's late ministers , sir , inform that they considered it , after mature de . beration , to be absolutely necessary to de something in order to allay the fermentation which appeared to exist in the minds of the Irish Roman catholics ; and they determined , in consequence , to request that his majesty would allow them to pro- 291 pose to parliament the extension of the provisions of the Irish act of 1793 to the rest of the empire , and thus to make that law in England , which at present is law in Ireland . Much has been said , sir , of the injustice , the absurdity , the great inconvenience and mischief of allowing that anomaly to continue , which arises from the act of 1793 not having operation beyond the limits of Ireland . But , sir , in my opinion , this is much more speculative than real , much more theoretical than practical . No case appears to me to have been clearly made out , of such inconvenience and mischief , though this direful , terrific anomaly has so long existed ; therefore , I think the correction of it not of so much importance as has been represented . His majesty 's late ministers , however , thought , otherwise , and acted upon that opinion . After much discussion , his majesty was at last prevailed upon to give his reluctant assent to the proposed measure . It is not denied that the consent was positive ; but it is equally certain that it was most reluctant . Now , sir , whence did this reluctance arise ? Undoubtedly not
