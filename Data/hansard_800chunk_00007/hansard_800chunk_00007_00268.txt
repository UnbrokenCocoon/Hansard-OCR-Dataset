object , and still more of the mode of pursuing it . He considered the change of government as a public misfortune , particularly in the present state of this country , and of Europe : but he would not on that account concur in attempting to force back the late ministers into the councils of the king . He acknowledged that he could not contemplate the present administration without feelings of anxiety and distrust , though he had a high opinion of some of the members of it ; and for the noble earl in particular , at the head of the ordnance , he entertained the 403 most affectionate respect , founded on an intercourse of friendship , which had neither abated nor been interrupted during a period of near 40 years . But , on the present occasion , he was not called upon to weigh the merits of the new government , but to discharge a duty to his sovereign , and to the constitution of his country and the difference between one set of ministers , and another , important as it unquestionably was , and particularly at such a crisis , appeared to him to be of less moment , than the difference between reducing the monarch to a cypher , and supporting him in the full exercise of his constitutional authority . These reflections , however , applied solely to the appointment of ministers , and not to the measures of government.—Lord Sidmouth concluded with saying , that he thought it incumbent upon him to state some particulars which appeared to him to be material , in order to place in its true light a transaction , which , he repeated , ought never to have been the subject of public discussion ; though the conduct of the great personage , who had been so much alluded to , must , he was confident , appear to have been such as to give him a fresh claim , if possible , to the veneration , affection , and gratitude of his people . In his vote on the question before the house , his lordship said he should be actuated by a determination to discountenance any proposition which might be considered as tending even by the most remote construction and inference to throw an imputation on the conduct of the king , or to fetter and controul his majesty in the exercise of his lawful prerogative ; and onthese grounds he should support the motion for the adjournment . and said : —My lords , in the course of my public life , I never heard a proposition more calmly , and decisively argued , than the proposition which has this night been submitted by my noble friend , to the consideration of this house . And never , my lords , was a mode of answer substituted , I will not only say , more unfair , but more calculated to excite unfounded prejudices , to propagate throughout the country a doctrine which must inevitably tend to produce improper feelings , and to mislead the general decision . Some noble lords have talked a great deal of conscientious scruples , and under the pretext of those scruples , they would call upon your lordships to judge of a constitutional question . Next , the noble viscount ( Sidmouth ) apprehends , and there- 404 fore concludes , that the resolution of my noble friend is directed against the character of my sovereign ; but I do contend , that a question , involving the conduct of the executive government , was never , in the history of this country , submitted to the decision of the legislature , in which the principle of responsibility was more clearly and accurately ascertained . The noble viscount has argued , that in order to make valid the charge against secret advisers , it must be proved , that the advice was given previous to the adoption of the measure . To this doctrine I can not subscribe , because I am convinced that constitutional responsibility embraces not only advice given previous to the measure taken
