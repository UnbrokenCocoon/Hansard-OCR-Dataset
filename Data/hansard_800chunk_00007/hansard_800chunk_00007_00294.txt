, sir , I hardly know how I should discharge my duty either towards myself , or towards the country , one of whose representatives I am , if I were to refrain from expressing any opinion at all upon a change so extraordinary as that which we have lately witnessed , particularly as that opinion must be at once the guide and the pledge of my conduct in parliament , perhaps for as long as I have the honour to sit in it.ߞBut before I touch upon these points with which it is connected , I beg to be clearly understood , as to what has been made the subject of so much wilful and malignant misrepresentation . No pains have been spared , and no falsehoods have been abstained from , in order to convince the people , that the late ministers were inclined to avail themselves of what , it seems , they fancied was the secure and permanent possession of power , in order to thwart the wishes and insult the feelings of their sovereign ; and that their friends in both houses of parliament are prepared to support them in this line of conduct , and are consequently the enemies both of his person and his prerogative.—Now for my own part I solemnly declare , that if I could see any thing in their conduct that could warrant such a suspicion , if I could see any thing inconsistent with the most , delicate regard for his individual feelings , and the most profound and constitutional reverence for his authority , I should be among the first to desert and to reprobate them . No man can feel more deeply than I do , the respect with which every good Englishman ought to approach the throne , nor am I at all inclined to countenance those subtle distinctions between the person and the office , which might tend to weaken a sentiment so closely interwoven with the very frame of our constitution . With regard to his present majesty , I am as sensible as any one of what is due to a monarch so venerable by his age , by the long period during which he has reigned over this great empire , and , more than all , by his piety and virtues . I have thought it necessary to say thus much in limine , in order to exonerate myself from a charge which has been so diligently disseminated by anonymous libellers out of doors , profes- 443 sing , falsely , no doubt , to speak the sentiments of the present ministers , but which , I flatter myself , no member of this house will be uncandid enough to impute either to the friends of the late government , or to the late government itself , which contained among its leading members , some of the oldest and most faithful servants of the crown , to whom his majesty neither made nor even hinted the slightest reproach of that kind upon dismissing them from office.—It is of the utmost importance that the late ministers should stand well with the public as to that transaction , and I am perfectly willing to declare , that I would on no account concur in a vote conveying a general approbation of their conduct , if it appeared that in the course of it they had acted in a manner inconsistent with their duty . But , fortunately for themselves , and fortunately for the country , nothing can be more clear , more concise , and more satisfactory , than the whole history of those circumstances which ended in their dismission . When stripped of those details by which , though curious and interesting in themselves , the substance of it is not affected , it is , in one word , this : His majesty 's ministers proposed to the house , in their ministerial capacity , a measure for which they imagined they had his consent . It turned out however upon further communication , that it had been given upon a misunderstanding of the real nature of the bill .
