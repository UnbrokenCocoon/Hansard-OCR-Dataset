only prove beneficial in case a channel of export be opened ; but , during our present almost total exclusion from the continent , can have little effect in relieving the distress now felt by the growers and holders of sugar : and , that the proposed additional duties on spirits , although very wisely and providently intended , will be comparatively of small benefit to the British plantations , unless a decided and marked preference be given to the consumption of rum in the navy and army.—That , under the progressive influence of the grievance , the effect of which has been experienced by your petitioners in the course of the last ten years , they are at last reduced to the hard necessity of continuing the cultivation of their estates at a very heavy loss , as they can not be rendered productive in any other culture . Documents already on the table of your honorable house , supported by the most respectable evidence , shew , that the average price of sugar , at the British market , has been , for some time past , barely equal to , often beneath , its positive cost to the planter , without any the smallest return for the capital embarked on the plantations , for the support of decreasing population , or for the maintenance of that numerous class of British subjects , whose sole dependence has hitherto been the produce and income returned for British industry and skill , exerted in the cultivation of the West India colonies , whereby your petitioners are reduced to a distress which they humbly conceive calls for the immediate attention , investigation , and relief of the legislature.—That your petitioners humbly suggest , as measures calculated for their relief , provisions of the following nature , either permanent , or co-existent with the present war , as may seem best to the wisdom of this honourable house ; namely , a revision of the system of taxation on sugar , and a reduction in the rate thereof , which , under a proportionate extension of the home consumption , might probably not diminish the revenue ; such provisions as may admit the article of sugar into preferable consumption in the distilleries and breweries , while its depression in price , compared with that of grain , may demand such preference ; the permission to barter the staple articles of sugar and coffee , as well as those of rum and molasses , with the American States , in return for lumber 89 and other necessaries , for a needful supply of which the colonies depend on an intercourse with those states.—And your petitioners humbly pray , that these measures , or such of them as may seem most expedient to this honourable house , or other measures adequate to the relief of your petitioners , under their present burthens and distress , may , by the wisdom of this honourable house , be provided and passed into law . And your petitioners shall ever pray , & c. '' and said , that this was a petition of considerable and extensive interest . It stated the extreme hard case of a large body of his Majesty 's industrious subjects , upon whose labours depended one great branch of our commerce , together with much of our maritime strength and financial prosperity , and who were reduced at length into the predicament of profiting nothing by their labours ; a situation which threatened their inevitable decay and ruin . He would , in a very cursory manner , advert to the general principles of policy upon which these colonies had been established , and to that system under which they are connected with the mother country . The doctrines of the economists , and of Dr. Adam Smith in particular , had been supposed to be more adverse to that policy , and to that system , than they would , on examination , prove . Those theorists had laid down principles true and good in themselves , but not adapted to invariable practice ; they had , as a sensible modern
