in parliament , and he had stated distinctly , that , if it should be brought forward , as his sentiments upon it did not depend on feelings , and opinions , entertained in any other quarter , or on circumstances which were temporary , no consideration should prevent or controul his determined opposition to it.—During a period of more than 12 months , nothing occurred which indicated a probability that the Catholics in Ireland were disposed to press the agitation of the question in parliament : but soon after the commencement of the present year , it because too probable , that their quiet forbearance was temporary , and that it was only by fresh concessions that their dissatisfaction could be restrained from venting itself in the form of petitions to the legislature.—At a meeting of his majesty 's cabinet at earl Spencer 's , on the 9th of Feb. various expedients which had been suggested for allaying this sort of irritation , were discussed , without being finally approved : a dispatch , however , to the lord lieutenant was produced by the noble lord at the head of the government ; which , from a misconception of the objects , that it appears to have been intended to embrace , gave rise to those embarrassments that ensued , and which ended in a change of ministers . That dispatch , and the reasoning by which it was recommended , appeared to him , and to other members of the cabinet , to refer exclusively to three objects , to which the attention of ministers was called , as was then stated by considerations of policy , good faith , and consistency . His majesty having been empowered , by the Irish act of 1793 , to grate military commissions to his Roman Catholic subjects , in Ireland ; it was deemed necessary from the considerations above stated , first , that persons holding commissions under the authority of that act , should not become liable to penalties , if called upon to serve in Great Britain : secondly that there should be secured to Roman Catholic officers , and soldiers , the same toleration in the exercise of their religion 392 which was afforded to all other classes of his majesty 's subjects : and thirdly , that the capacity of holding military commissions , which was conferred by the Irish act , should be extended to his majesty 's Catholic subjects in this part of the united kingdom . Such a measure was stated to derive importance and urgency from the circumstances of the times , which called for the united zeal and strength of the whole population of the empire , to enable it to cope with the immense military power , and insatiable ambition of the enemy.—Much stress was also laid upon intimations given in the year 1793 , by lord Clare in the Irish house of lords , and by Mr. Hobart , now lord Buckinghamshire , then chief secretary to the lord lieutenant , in the house of commons , of an intention on the part of the English government , to propose to the parliament of this country a measure , similar to that which was adopted in Ireland ; but though Mr. Pitt 's administration continued 8 years from that time , no such measure was brought forward , and though he had since been 5 years in office with his noble friend the earl of Buckinghamshire , he had never heard of this supposed pledge till the present occasion . It had however been explained by his noble friend on a former night , in a manner which had materially weakened , if not destroyed the argument , which was founded upon it.—when this dispatch was first under discussion , he had stated explicitely that he would not agree to any new concession , and that if it was a question whether the king should now , for the first time , be empowered by law to grant military commissions to his Roman Catholic subjects , he should entertain strong doubts of the expediency and policy of such a
