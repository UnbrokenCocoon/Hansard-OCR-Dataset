, was heard defending himself from a charge in the house of commons , by contending , that the whole power of the privy council of Scotland was vested in his official character ; although one of the acts which followed closest on the heels of the union , was to deprive that office of such extraordinary and unlimited powers . The arguments of the court of session , on this point , shewed such an ignorance of the occurrences of modern periods , as applying to their case , that it was fair to assume , a fortiori , that the facts of more remote times were not either well understood , or correctly stated . With respect to the opinion , that the attendance of the judges of the court of session , on appeals in the house , was a desirable circumstance , it was not his wish to throw any censure on the learned persons entrusted with the jurisprudence of Scotland ; but he could not help remarking , that he had heard within the walls of the house sufficient to induce him to deprecate such an inclination . Indeed , he thought the Opinion of Mr. Boswell quite convincing ; who , when told on an appeal cause , in which he was engaged , that the court of session was unanimous in passing the decree , pointedly replied , `` that when that court were divided in opinion , they deliberated but little ; but when it happened that they were unanimous , they deliberated not at all . '' With respect to the ingenious remark , that the precedents which denied the Scotch judges the right , referred only to the lords justiciary , and not to the court of session , he should only answer , that as the lord chief justice clerk was also a member of the court of session , he could not admit the position , that if he was in either character entitled to the right , he ought to be denied , because he might be summoned to attend with respect to the duties of another office .

He considered it a churlish principle , in any great kingdom , to deal illiberally with those of other countries , which , in their union , had given up much of national pride and independent magnificence . The services of the learned persons who were in attendance on the service of the house , he had occasion to know , when he held the important office of secretary for the home department , at a period when that part of the country was endangered by revolutionary cabals , and treasonable conspiracies . He wished the judges of every part of the kingdom to be treated with every reverence and respect , because it tended to promote that love of justice , which was the strongest fortress of the subordination of society.—The motion for admitting the Scotch judges within the body of the house was then put and negatived.—The house having resolved itself into a committee , thought it would be the most convenient mode for him to communicate to the committee his ideas upon the subject , previous to moving any particular amendment , the different parts of the bill being intimately connected , and the amendments which he should move being those which arose out of his general view of the measure He admitted that a great evil existed in the number of appeals to that house from Scotland , and that a remedy ought to be applied , but he disliked going further than the remedying that evil required . He approved of the division of the court of session , but thought that instead of three chambers it would be much preferable to have only two chambers , consisting of eight judges and seven ; the lord president being in one chamber ,
