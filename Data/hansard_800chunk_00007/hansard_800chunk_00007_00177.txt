assumed a more decided form , and he offered his resignation in consequence of them ; but though , after the introduction of the bill , I had communication with his majesty in the course of my official duty on other subjects , I had no reason till the Wednesday following , when I was absent both from this house and front my usual attendance on his majesty , on ac 271 count of the death of a near relation , to believe that any extension whatever of the proposed measure , beyond the provisions of the Irish act , had been found absolutely irreconcilable with his principles and his feelings . On that day ( Wednesday , March the 11th ) , his majesty stated to lord Grenville his decided objection , and referred , as having before signified this objection , to the conversation with which he had honoured me on the preceding Wednesday . I certainly had not so understood his majesty . If I had , I need not say that I should have found myself bound by every motive of interest and duty to submit so important a circumstance to the consideration of my colleagues before I moved for leave to bring in the bill . But , sir , it would have been most unbecoming in me , even if I could have entertained such a suspicion , to insinuate a doubt of the royal word . We were convinced that the king had been misunderstood by me , and as I had been placed in the unfortunate situation of introducing the bill under this misapprehension , I thought it my duty to suspend any further proceedings upon it , till I should have had an opportunity of explaining to his majesty the circumstances of my conduct . I accordingly on the night of Thursday the 12th proposed to the house to postpone the second reading of the bill to a farther day , and at the same time requested an audience of his majesty , which he was graciously pleased to honour me with on the following morning . Upon laying before his majesty the reasons which had induced me to believe that I was not as his minister acting in opposition to his royal pleasure ; he was pleased to express his conviction that what had happened had arisen from an erroneous conception on my part , but acquitted me most graciously , but most unequivocally , of any intentional disregard of his opinions . From that moment it became a matter of the most anxious consideration to his majesty 's ministers how they might best repair the effects of the misunderstanding which had taken place ; they immediately applied their attention to the means of reducing the new bill to the standard of the Irish act , in the hope that they might be able still to carry it forward as an useful public measure under the sanction of his majesty 's consent . But when we came to examine the objections that had been made to it , they were found to affect the measure in so considerable a degree , that , upon a full consideration of the subject , we were convinced there could be no hope of correcting the bill in such a man- 272 ner as to relieve it from the objections that prevailed against it , and at the same time leave it in a state in which it would be likely to attain those ends which his majesty 's late ministers had in view when it was originally proposed.—In this situation , Sir , after anxiously weighing all the circumstances of the case , we determined— ( I should here explain that the representations which were made in this stage of the proceedings were confined to those members of the cabinet who had concurred in opinion upon the measure to its full extent , ) we determined , however painful the sacrifice might personally be , to abandon the bill altogether . It was , I say , a most painful sacrifice of personal feeling to public duty ; a sacrifice which nothing short
