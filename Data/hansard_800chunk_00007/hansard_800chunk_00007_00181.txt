public duty ; that we considered it would be , criminal in us to bind ourselves to withhold from his majesty , under all the circumstances that might arise , the counsels that might appear to us indispensably necessary ; and that it was not possible for us , consistently with our sense of our obligations as the king 's sworn counsellors , to give assurances which would impose upon us a restraint , incompatible with the faithful discharge of our most important duty . The consequence was , that the next day , his majesty , certainly with the most gracious and kind expressions with regard to every other part of our conduct , communicated to us his intention to look out for other ministers . On the day after , we heard that other persons ; not then in the number of his majesty 's servants , had been sent for ; and I was authorised a few days afterwards , in consequence of a request which I made , to declare to the house that it was his majesty 's intention to form a 277 New Administration , On Tuesday last , his majesty signified to us his pleasure , that should , on the following day , deliver up our seals of office ; we accordingly did so — This , sir , is the history of the whole transaction . I have not referred to any papers to support my statement but I do wish , and am extremely anxious , that all the documents that can be furnished may meet the public eye not in an improper mutilated , or partial state . I shall be most happy , if his majesty is graciously pleased to give permission to his new servants to produce every paper hat has passed upon the subject , in order that they may undergo the fullest examination in this house . I trust it will appear from those papers , that the statement I have made is correct in all its parts ; and if that statement be correct , that the house will be satisfied upon the following points ; first , that it was not without strong inducements of public interest that we proposed this measure originally to his majesty ; secondly , that whatever misunderstanding may unfortunately have arisen , we did not propose it to parliament without a firm persuasion that it had his majesty 's sanction ; thirdly , that when that misunderstanding was discovered , we went to the utmost limits of our duty in conceding the measure upon that misunderstanding had arisen ; and , fourthly , that in addition to that concession , under the peculiar circumstances in which we were placed , the respectful request that we submitted to his majesty , to allow us the liberty to explain our opinions and conduct upon the particular measure , accompanied , as it was , by a declaration of our wish to consult his personal ease and comfort , was not wantonly pressed upon his majesty , but from motives of duty find respect ; arid that the reserve we made as to the freedom of our future advice , was indispensable to our character and situation , as ministers of the crown and as servants of the public —These , sir , are therefore the points which I wish the house to understand , This statement , which , though at some length , is after all perhaps too cursorily given , is that which I have wished to lay before the house and the public . I shall be ready now , or at any future time , to go more fully into it whenever it shall be required of me.—Sir , I shall conclude by declaring that I feel no disposition to complain . I am sure , as I have already stated , that there can be but one feeling and one opinion of the gracious Kindness of his majesty , with respect to 278 every class and description of his subjects ; and so far from being a party to join in any thing that might
