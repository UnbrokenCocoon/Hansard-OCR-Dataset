in figurative language , like all those 381 principles which juridical writers express under the form of fictions . These maxims , stripped of their metaphor , and translated into plain language , appear to me to mean : 1st , that the king has no power , by the constitution , to do any public act of government , but through the medium of some minister , who is held responsible for the act : and , 2dly , That the personal actions of the king , not being acts of government , are not under the cognizance of law.—The principle that the king can never act without advice , applies therefore only to acts of government . This interpretation is quite sufficient for the purpose , which that maxim is intended to effect , viz , to secure the people from the abuses of bad government , through the restraint which the fear of responsibility may put on ministers . If this responsibility attaches on every act of government , on every act of the king in his executive or legislative capacity , the people have all the security , which that maxim can impart ; and it would be absurd to extend it to the personal actions of the king as an individual , to the occurrences of his domestic life , or to the circumstances which may arise in the course of confidential communication between him and his ministers , previously to their determining on any measure , which is afterwards to make its appearance to the public as an act of government.—Upon a change of ministry , the new ministers are undoubtedly responsible for the dismissal of their predecessors as a public act of government ; and where the dismissal is connected with any other public measure , on that likewise , retrospectively , they become responsible for the negative of their predecessor 's intentions , but not for any private consultations , between the king and his former ministers , which did not terminate in any public measure . In the present case , the demand of a pledge from the late ministers , can not be considered in any other light than as an occurrence of private consultation in the cabinet ; an occurrence which can not be a proper subject of parliamentary enquiry , since it is only in consequence of the king 's permission that the knowledge of the fact could ever have come to parliament . That permission was granted for the sole purpose of enabling some of his late ministers to clear their characters of aspersions thrown upon them , and it is surely a most improper trespass upon the generosity which led to that permission , that a proceeding , such as the pre- 382 sent , should be founded upon it ; a proceeding which , however it may be intended by the noble persons who bring it forward , can not be debated without a continual infringement of that important constitutional maxim , that the personal actions of the king are not to be made the subject of discussion.—Upon the whole then it appears that the argument in favour of the present motion rests entirely upon the gross fallacy , of considering the demand of a pledge from ministers as an insulated fact , and their refusal as the only assignable motive for dismissing them . It appears on the contrary , that , independently altogether of any such refusal , the dismissal would have been justifiable ; that , before the demand was made , circumstances had occurred which might naturally and fairly have led to that dismissal . If upon receiving that minute of council , by which his ministers agreed to give up the Catholic bill , the king , instead of requiring that the reservations should be withdrawn , had immediately and without further explanation , sent for the seals of office , could any one venture to say that the act would have been unconstitutional ? and shall we be told that the act which the king might constitutionally have done before the demand of a pledge , became unconstitutional after
