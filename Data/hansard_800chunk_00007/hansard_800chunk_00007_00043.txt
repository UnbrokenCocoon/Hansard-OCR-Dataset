requested , in a letter to the adjutant general , dated on the 22d of June 1804 , that `` no part of the grounds , on which major Gordon had proposed to found , his charges , should be kept back from examination ; '' from which facts your petitioner is satisfied , that it will clearly appear to your honourable house , that if the court martial was inhibited from taking cognizance of the charge aforesaid , the inhibition was to be ascribed solely to those concerned in framing and bringing forward the prosecution . That , however , to the most important fact , connected with the aforesaid remark of the king , it remains for your petitioner to pray the attention of your honourable house ; namely , that notwithstanding the lapse of time , the court martial actually did , before they perceived such lapse , fully investigate the merits of the said charge ; that the charge was , by evidence the most complete , clearly proved to be utterly false , and destitute of the 75 semblance of foundation ; and that it was not until after such proof had been given , I that the court martial discovered that they were , by law , inhibited from taking cognizance of it . That it was nevertheless , upon the ground of the remark made by the judge advocate general , in the king 's name , that the duke of York , in a letter to your petitioner , dated on the 16th of May , 1805 , refused to place your petitioner in that situation , as to rank , to which he was , by his seniority , entitled .

'' That , thus , as it must be manifest to your honourable house , the judge advocate general has the power to communicate to the commander-in-chief remarks , in the king 's name , upon the decision of every general court martial , from which remarks alone the commander-in-chief must according to his letter above mentioned addressed to your petitioner , `` form his opinion upon the whole matter of each case ; '' that the judge advocate general has the further power of altering such remarks at his pleausure , not only without the orders , but even without the knowledge of the king , in whose name they are made ; that this judge advocate general not only holds his office during pleasure , but is at the same time so much under the influence of the commander in chief , as to be induced , at his bare suggestion , to change his intention as to the person whom he shall employ to officiate in his stead at a court martial ; and that , thus , the fame and fortune of all the officers of the army , ( an establishment , the annual expence of which is now more than eighteen millions sterling ) 76 amounting , in number , to several thousands of gentlemen , connected by ties of
