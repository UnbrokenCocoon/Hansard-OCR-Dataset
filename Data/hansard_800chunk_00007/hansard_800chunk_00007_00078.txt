, at such a moment , professing an anxiety to assist the brewers , have projected a measure which they believed would set their factories on fire , how consolatory must it be to them to hear him exclaim—Well , I am glad I know your case , for now you can not say that it is my projected measure which has occasioned your ruin ! The distress of the West India colonies at this moment , sir , arises from their having complied with the urgent stimulation of the mother country , in furnishing her not only with produce amply sufficient for her own consumption , but also with a large surplus to enrich her by foreign trade ; and , because the foreign market , not by their fault , is denied to the colonists , they ask you to support them under the burthen of producing what has been , and may again be , a most profitable resource to yourselves.—On the political value of the colonies , and the intimate connection of their prosperity with our naval power , having on another occasion spoken , at some length , I will now be silent ; and very shortly advert to the danger of insurrection in the islands connected with the present bill . Sir , I do not desire to look on the gloomy side , and will hope that our colonies may not undergo the rapid fate of Saint Domingo ; but I can not forbear to notice what we have heard upon high authority , that the people of France do connect the revolution in Saint Domingo with the abolition of the slave trade . The noble lord ( Lauderdale ) who , in the course of the late negociation , was thus informed , is said to have replied , that he believed otherwise . I respect much , sir , the manly understanding of that noble lord , but can not consider his opinion on this subject as of equal value with that generally diffused over the French nation , who witnessed the whole course of that dreadful event , who knew the pains taken by the Amis des Noirs to spread their doctrines in the colonies , and who read the twopenny and threepenny publications , which there too teemed from the press , inviting the negroes `` to break their chains upon the heads of their oppressors . '' Expressions equally inflammatory I could shew the noble lord ( Howick ) who sits on the bench before me , in the pamphlets which have been circulated here , although I doubt not that his mind has never been sullied by 127 the perusal of them , and that he therefore thought an allusion which I made to them upon a former clay less justifiable than it really was . Sir , it is not the debates of this house ( of which we are charged with permitting the circulation in the colonies ) that are so much calculated to impress the mind of the negro , as an act of legislation , the operation of which he will immediately see , and the grounds and motives of which he will then naturally make the objects of his enquiry.—This , sir , I think is the proper moment for my acknowledging that protection to our characters , which some hon . gents have thought fit to interpose against the abuse which others have so copiously bestowed upon us . I have , sir , carefully estimated the amount of that protection , and I think it is this : 'these West India planters and merchants , ' say they , 'are , for aught we know , anatomically constructed , much like other people ; they have a scull , a brain , a pia and a dura mater , like ourselves ; but man is the creature of habit , and their habits are detestably bad . Their early associations fill their minds with inveterate prejudices , which prevent them either from understanding or feeling like the rest of the world : but then let us not be too severe
