assurances , that after effecting these farther arrangements the agreement made with him should be no longer delayed , but settled to his entire satisfaction , yet , on his return , he had the mortification to encounter further impediments from the Post Office ; and he therefore most earnestly and warmly pressed the minister to carry his agreement with him into immediate execution , and by granting him the promised powers put an end to these hostile attacks from the office , so injurious both to himself and the public ; and that Mr. Pitt acknowledged the necessity as well as justice of this demand ; and his anxious wish to comply with it ; and at last observed , `` That it would be a great satisfaction to his mind , and more fully authorise and justify the agreement with the public , if sanction 226 ed by the Report of the Commissioners of Inquiry , after their full investigation into the whole of the proceedings . '' Unexpected and distressing as this further procrastination was , the proposal appeared so candid and proper that the petitioner could not but consent to it ; and that in 1788 the Commissioners of Inquiry made their Report as to the Post Office ; and stated , with respect to the petitioner , `` That he had performed his agreement with government far beyond his promise , not only as to expedition and safety , but at Â£20,000 per annum less than was proposed ; and that he had accomplished his object in despite of numerous difficulties , and a most powerful opposition , and every obstruction that could be thrown in his way by the officers of the General Post Office ; and therefore the commissioners declared the petitioner justly entitled to his specified compensation , being a very small part of that increased revenue which his integrity , activity , and zeal , had created , exclusive of the convenience and numerous collateral advantages which the country at large , and more particularly the commercial part of it , derived from his exertions ; '' and that , after this examination and decision by the commissioners , the petitioner , at the end of December 1788 , wrote to the minister , requesting him to fulfil his original agreement , stating at the same time that he had Various other plans which he conceived of the greatest consequence to the correspondence of the kingdom and particularly of the metropolis and its neighbourhood , which waited this final adjustment to enable him to carry into execution : and that further delays now arose from the peculiar and unfortunate circumstances which occurred at that time , and the consequent embarrassments of government , and at last from the difficulties the petitioner experienced in his pecuniary concerns ; wearied out with these continued mortifying and vexatious delays , to which he saw no probable end , and against which , or to compel the performance of his agreement , he had no legal remedy , he , at the earnest desire of the minister , consented to continue further to act with the limited and uncertain powers he hitherto had done , but under the strongest assurances on the part of Mr. Pitt , `` that there should be no future interference with his regulations from the General Post Office , and that he should feel himself equally protected and advantaged in all respects as if possessed of the intended Patent Grant of 1785 , and that he might be assured his agreement was 227 equally Valid as if sanctioned by an act of parliament ; and that soon after a new appointment was sent to him , and he was paid , after seven years delay , the whole arrears of the salary and per centage to that time , and agreeably to his modified agreement of 1785 , but he was allowed nothing for his time previous to the commencement of the plan in August 1714 , or for his subsequent great expences in England , or even in France Or Ireland , nor was there any mentioned reversion of
