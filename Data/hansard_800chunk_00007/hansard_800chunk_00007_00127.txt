supplied for their support . As the grant of places for life therefore had such a direct tendency to deprive the crown of the power of punishing weak or wicked , and of rewarding its meritorious servants , the motion for the address should have his warmest support . had felt so anxious to be 198 present at the discussion of this question , that he had delayed accepting the office which , but for the notice given by the honourable gentleman the preceding night , he should , ere this , have held . He thought it his duty by his presence to take care that if the house thought fit to address his majesty , it should be on accurate statements , and that no uncertain rumours should usurp the place of facts . He could not for a moment suppose , whatever might be the motives of his hon . and learned friend , that the present motion proceeded from any personal ill-will towards himself , because , in the whole of his intercourse with his learned friend , he was not conscious of a single circumstance from , which such ill-will could arise . It was unquestionably true , that he had received an offer from his majesty of the chancellorship of the exchequer , accompanied with a grant of the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster for life ; and that , but for his learned friend 's notice , he should at that moment have been in possession of both those situations ; his learned friend , therefore , was not chargeable with surprise in bringing forward his motion at so short a notice , as otherwise the season of it would have gone by . He was not in the house the preceding evening ; but understanding that such a notice had been given , instead of approaching his sovereign for the purpose of receiving his appointment to office , he had approached him with a request that the appointment might not take place on that day , that he might have an opportunity of addressing the house on the subject ; and still more , that his majesty might not be fettered , in consequence of any advice that the house might think proper to offer him . This request was accompanied with an assurance , as his majesty had been pleased to think that he could be an useful servant , that , whatever might be the pleasure of his majesty in consequence of any address from the house of commons , although it should deprive him of the duchy of Lancaster , formerly offered , it would not in the slightest degree abate his wish to serve his majesty . Unquestionably , though in the first instance lie should not have felt justified in neglecting his duty to his family by quitting a lucrative profession without the prospect of something like compensation , yet when he found his majesty thought his services might be advantageous to the interest of the country , and when he saw the crisis in which that country was placed , he felt it no longer to be a matter of option with him , but that whatever might be the consequences 199 to himself , his sovereign should command the utmost exertion of his humble abilities . With respect to the two precedents alluded to by his learned friend , he would not compare himself with the object of either , but that lord Ashburton should be allowed , without notice , to accept for life the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster , impressed on him the belief that no parliamentary objection existed against such an appointment . Lord Ashburton was taken out of the profession of the law by an administration professedly of pure Whig principles , that of lord Rockingham ; and the grant to him of the duchy of Lancaster was afterwards confirmed to him under the administration of a near relative of the noble lord opposite ( the marquis of Lansdowne ) . Lord Ashburton was a man with whom it would Certainly be presumptuous for him to compare himself
