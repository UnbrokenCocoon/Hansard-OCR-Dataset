commodities of other countries and places , for the supplying of them , and it being the usage of other nations to keep their plantations trade to themselves . '—That , in conformity to the intimate union and relations here delineated , the colonial system of Great Britain has , in subsequent times , been systematically established ; whereby , in every essential respect , the industry , trade and navigation , of the Colonies , are strictly confined to the interests of the mother country ; she , in return , granting to them and to their productions an exclusive or marked preference at her home markets , a facility of meeting in foreign markets a vent for the surplus of their produce beyond her own ample supply , and her needful support and protection against enemies , foreign and domestic.—That , however , in various instances , and more particularly since the calamity that befell the once flourishing colony of St Domingo , ( whereby a temporary and accidental encrease of value was given to the great staple productions of the Colonies ) , the colonial system of the British Empire has been varied or departed from , to the disadvantage 87 of her Colonies ; restrictions have been imposed upon the access of their surplus produce to the foreign market , thereby affording a powerful stimulus to the cultivation of foreign Colonies ; the production of their principal staple article , sugar , has been encouraged and promoted in dependencies of the empire not subject to colonial regulations ; a progressive taxation on sugar has been accumulated , which is calculated to impede the natural progress of its consumption in a prosperous and luxurious nation ; and , while the progress of taxes at home , naturally attending a state of war , has , in the course of the last twenty years , doubled the cost of every article which the Colonies import from the mother country for their use and necessary cultivation , the anxious care of the British legislature appears to have been directed to every measure that might , at any time , prevent the colonial produce from obtaining the advantages of any temporary . demand and addition to its value , unattended with regulations , on the other hand , competent to protect the colonist from depressed and ruinous prices.—That , more particularly in the late wars , in which the mother country has unfortunately been compelled to engage , has the pressure of the existing colonial system been felt by the British West India Colonies ; the access to a foreign market of that surplus produce , Which , for her advantage , and , in order to her own ample supply , the repeated public voice of the mother country has urged and stimulated the Colonies to grow , has been often impeded and sometimes denied.— In the mean time , the produce of those colonies , which have , at any time , by the fortune of war , fallen into our hands , has been admitted to form an additional glut at the home market , and placed on a footing there with the produce of our old Colonies . And , as if to render the evil irreparable , and the case desperate , the great and acknowledged superiority of the British navy has not been exerted in impeding the transit of the colonial produce of the enemy to its European market , whereby the inducement , which the enemy might have , to except colonial produce from the rigour of our general exclusion from the continental trade , is taken away , and the British colonist , under all the increased and continually increasing expences of war is subjected to contend , now and henceforward , with rivals , exempted from those charges , and enjoying the most advantageous markets , without the impediment of British competition.—That measure have 88 lately been recommended to parliament , professedly intended to afford relief to your petitioners , but which , so far as they respect sugar , the great staple article the British West India colonies , can
