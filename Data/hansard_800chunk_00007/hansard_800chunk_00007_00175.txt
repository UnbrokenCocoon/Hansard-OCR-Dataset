myself sufficiently 268 attended to the distinction between it and the Irish act . When this appeared , it became the subject of a new deliberation , in which an objection was stated by a respectable member of the cabinet ( the lord president ) to any concession beyond the Irish act . A majority , however , concurred in recommending the measure in the form in which it was afterwards introduced ; but as doubts had arisen , and an apprehension was entertained that it might have been misunderstood by his majesty , it was determined to bring the matter distinctly under his royal observation , by a second dispatch to the lord lieutenant , clearly stating its full extent.—And here I must state , that some distinctions ought to be taken between the duties of ministers and those of private members of parliament . I conceive that a minister may , as an individual member of parliament , introduce measures for which the authority of government is not at all pledged ; I could adduce instances of this in the administration of the late Mr. Pitt , The house will at once recollect the motion for a reform in parliament , and that for the abolition of the slave trade : both these motions were introduced by him as an individual member of parliament , without the responsibility of government being attached to them . Sir , during the short period that I have had the honour of holding a situation under his majesty , I and my noble colleague have , in the same manner , brought forward successfully the measure of the abolition of the slave trade , to which I shall look with satisfaction for the remainder of my days . But , sir , where a measure arising out of various causes which have engaged the attention of his majesty 's confidential servants , is to be brought forward with the authority of government , the measure itself , as well as the case to which it applies , ought undoubtedly to be first submitted to his majesty . I certainly feel that I ought not to have introduced a measure of this description without the sanction of that authority ; and I should think myself reprehensible in the highest degree , and deserving all the censure that is endeavoured to be cast upon me , if I had proposed this bill to parliament without believing that I had his majesty 's consent.—Sir , I have stated that a doubt arose as to the understanding of the extent of this bill ; it was therefore determined ( lord Spencer at that time being absent on account of his health ) that I should write a dispatch to the lord lieutenant , enclosing the clauses intended to be introduced into the Mutiny bill , stating distinctly that they were 269 in conformity with the general words of the dispatch which had been sent on the 12th of February last , marking expressly that the catholics were to be admitted to hold any commission or appointment whatever ; and observing that a confirmation was thus given of Mr. Elliot 's answer to the catholic deputies . This dispatch , so expressed for the purpose of removing all doubts , and inclosing , as I have already stated , the intended clauses , was sent down by me , on Monday night , the 2d of March , to his majesty . This dispatch , having been perused by his majesty , came back from Windsor on the following morning , without a word of comment or objection ; and with this sanction I acted , as in the course of my official business I had been uniformly accustomed to do —I immediately forwarded it to the lord lieutenant —Sir , at this time the committee on the Mutiny bill was , I believe , appointed for the Wednesday ; but objections had been started to the enactment of the proposed measure by clauses in that bill : it was therefore , upon reconsideration , determined to introduce a separate bill .
