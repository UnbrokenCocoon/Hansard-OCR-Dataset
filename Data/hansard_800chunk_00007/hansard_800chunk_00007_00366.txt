( who had been waiting in the lobby for the Speaker 's arrival ) announced himself in the usual way , with a message from the house of peers . The Speaker consequently took his seat in the chair , and Mr. Quarme came into the body of the house , and delivered the following message : — '' Mr. Speaker , The lords , authorized by virtue of his majest . commiss . for declaring the royal assent to several bills which have been agreed to by both houses , and also for proroguing this present parliament , do desire the immediate attendance of this hon . house in the house of peers , to hear the commission read . `` —The Speaker then accompanied by most of the members present , proceeded to the house of lords , and on his return calling the members round the table , read to them a copy of the King 's speech ; after which the members separated.—Thus ended the First and only Session of the Third Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland .
