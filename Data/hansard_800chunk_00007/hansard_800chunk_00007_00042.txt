means created , your petitioner was honourably acquitted upon all the charges preferred against him , notwithstanding so much study and preparation had been used in the producing of those charges ; that , not only was he so acquitted , but there was not brought out in evidence , one single fact tending in the slightest degree to shew , that the accuser himself could possibly ever have believed any one of the charges to be true ; and that it was glaringly evident , that the whole of the accusation consisted of falsehoods invented for the sole purpose of injuring the fame and the fortune of your petitioner , and of giving the colour of justice to the punishment which had already been inflicted upon him . That your petitioner , upon the result of the trial being made known unto him , did , on the 18th of April , 1805 , endeavour to obtain an audience of his royal highness the duke of York , in order to obtain , in the list of major-generals , that place to which his seniority entitled him , and in the obtaining of which he had , by his royal highness , been informed , there would be `` no difficulty , provided the result of the court martial was favourable to him . '' That your petitioner , having been refused access to the duke of York in the first instance , having been unable by other means to obtain any satisfactory answer to his repeated applications , tendered the resignation of his commission as colonel , resolved no longer to remain in a service , in which he was so unjustly held in a state of degradation .

'' That as your honourable house will not fail to perceive , this remark was calculated to cause it to be believed , that , if no lapse of time had so taken place , and if the court martial had not thereby been inhibited from proceeding on the said charge , the said charge might have been established against your petitioner : whereas , the facts were ; 1st , That the act charged , was alledged to have taken place previous to September 1801 ; 2d , That an investigation into the conduct of your petitioner was contemplated by the duke of York in October 1803 , and upon that contemplation he withheld the name of your petitioner from the brevet promotion ; 3d , That , between September 1801 and October 1803 , only two years and one month had elapsed ; 4th , That beween October 1803 and August 1804 , when the warrant for the trial was , at last , issued , your petitioner did make urgent and repeated requests to the duke of York , that the trial might take place without delay ; and 5th . That your petitioner , apprehensive that a plea of lapse of time might be made use of , for the purpose of leaving a blemish upon his reputation , expressly
