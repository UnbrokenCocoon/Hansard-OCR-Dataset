was thus engaged in preparations to bring forward his cause , expecting it to have been heard on the 24th of feb. , he had 25 intelligence given him , upon which he thought he might securely rely , that practices had been made use of by various persons whose names I will presently state—that practices prevailed to a very considerable extent , which threatened the loss of several of his witnesses , and which were addressed , from day to day , with the hope of endeavouring to persuade others to deprive him of that testimony , at least of a part of it , which was afterwards to support his cause.—Now , sir , laying aside all personal considerations end considering this petitioner as merely in the character of a party having presented a petition to the house , which was in progress to being heard—which stood for hearing—which he had a right to prosecute , complaining of his having been deprived of the right to a seat in this house , on behalf of himself and a number of electors , who , to the number of 4 or 5000 , had given him their votes upon the occasion , what was it his duty to himself , to them , and to the house to do , if he thought this charge was well founded ; if he had reason to believe that these practices did actually prevail ; what was the duty he owed to the house , to himself , to his constituents , I might even say to the individual who is accused , but to bring it forward where it was sure to be fairly , impartially and thoroughly discussed , in order that it might at least be seen , whether the suspicions that prevailed abroad upon this subject were well or ill founded ? —What was it incumbent upon him to do more than , if he brought it forward , to bring it fairly forward , and , in the first place , for that purpose to put his cause into the hands of the most respectable solicitors there are in the profession , and I am persuaded that I shall be fortified by the knowledge of every member of this house who knows those gentlemen , that in all the profession there can not be found gentlemen who stand higher , of purer honour , of greater respectability , and more unblemished character than Messrs. Williams and Brooks , and their clerk , Mr. Powell , who are engaged in the business . More honourable and more respectable persons do not exist in the profession . I hope the house will forgive me , if I presume thus to testify in their behalf ; because , if , on a subject of this nature , from any accidental causes witnesses appear on any account to be less deserving of credit , a degree of blame and disgrace may appear to attach to those who are concerned . I do not know whether that May not comprehend all that are concerned on this side , and I 26 therefore have been particularly desirous to present myself upon the occasion and to bear my share of blame upon the subject , at any inconvenience to myself , rather , than shrink from the discharge of my professional duty on behalf of any person for whom I may be employed.—Sir , I take the liberty of saying it is of infinite importance , not only to the individual , but to the public , that the persons who deserve the character of honest men , should receive it ; because it is of the highest importance , that causes and petitions should be in such hands , rather than that , by their falling into the hands of others , practices should take place which it is not easy to detect . This was the comfort of the person for whom I appear , and whatever representations there may be to the disadvantage of it ; whatever judgment gentlemen may be disposed to pass on the evidence they have heard ,
