receiving the letter aforesaid from the Duke of York , lost no time in most earnestly soliciting his Royal Highness to afford him information as to the nature and purport of the charges existing against him ; but , that , unto his repeated entreaties for this purpose , no answer whatever was he able to obtain , until the 28th day of the ensuing month of May , when , after having been thus kept in a state of suspense and disgrace for six months , he was informed , by order of the Duke of York , that he , the Duke of York , had now called upon Major Gordon ( the accuser ) to state whether he meant to bring forward any charges at all 72 against your petitioner ; so that , as your honourable house will perceive , your petitioner was now , informed , not of the nature of the charges against him , but that the Duke of York had not yet ascertained whether there were in existence the grounds whereon to form any such charges , though , as it will be perceived by your honourable house , your petitioner had actually been punished , upon the ground , as stated by the Duke of York himself , that charges existed against your petitioner in the preceding month of October . That your petitioner , conscious , that no criminal charge could , with truth , be preferred against him , impatiently waited for the day of trial , which , however , to the great vexation and injury of your petitioner , was delayed until the month of March , 1805 , though , according to the Duke of York 's letter of the 10th of December , 1803 , the charges actually existed against your petitioner in the month of October preceding , â€”a year and a half before it was thought proper to proceed upon them .

That your petitioner , at no loss as to the motive of this interference , adhered the more resolutely to his aforesaid objection ; but that , though he , finally , and with much difficulty , succeeded in this point , he , to his great mortification , found , that , immediately afterwards , the seat of the court martial , which was , by the order of the Duke of York , actually assembling at Canterbury , whither , towards the end of February , your petitioner and several of his witnesses had repaired , was , all of a sudden , 73 removed to Chelsea , notwithstanding the remonstrance of your petitioner , who , in letter to the judge advocate general , dated on the 21st of February , 1805 , stated , that `` great inconvenience and expence would be occasioned by this change , as well as the impossibility of transmitting timely notice of it to the witnesses , particularly those resident in distant parts of the kingdom . '' That , in spite of all the disadvantages , by these and other
