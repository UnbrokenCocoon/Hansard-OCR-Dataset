there is not a single tittle of evidence , much as the witnesses have been pressed , and properly pressed , by questions addressed to them from every quarter ; there is not one single tittle which shews that the conduct of the petitioner , from the first moment he was made acquainted with the suspicions respecting the subjects of this charge , was any otherwise than would have been observed by the most honorable man living ; having first cautioned the witness who disclosed these facts to him ; guarding him not to speak any thing but the truth , and by no means to overstate the truth ; having on no occasion offered him any money , or any inducement whatever , not distinctly to disclose the fact , and every subject relating to it . I hope , therefore , I stand fair thus far with the house , that the conduct of the petitioner was from the peril either of losing his testimony or preferring his complaint to the only competent authority to receive it ; for it would not have been respectful for the petitioner to have carried his complaint any where else . If there were just grounds to carry a complaint any where , it could be no where but to this house , and it could be conducted only in the way it has been , up to the point I am now stating—Sir , permit me to observe in the next place , what are the charges contained in this petition , and what is the evidence in support of it . The petitioner states , that he was a candidate at the last election for the city of Westminster ; an unsuccessful candidate in consequence of which he had presented a petition to this house , complaining of an undue election , and praying that that subject might be taken into consideration ; that that 27 stood for trial on the 24th of Feb ; that that was afterwards postponed till a more distant date , and that intelligence was given to him that persons were actually at work to deprive him of his testimony , to induce persons to go out of the way , and particularly to dispossess him of important documents by which he hoped to support his cause . The petition has fairly and distinctly stated , not in general terms only , who were the persons that had been guilty of this practice ; but the names of the witnesses that were sent , or attempted to be sent , out of the way , and the particular circumstances attendant upon the transaction.—Sir , it is particularly stated in the petition , that one William Drake was , and still is , a material witness summoned on behalf of your petitioner ; that the said Drake having , on or about the 10th of this instant Feb. , & c. [ `` Mr. Plumer here read an extract from the petition ending , `` and added , that when they had succeeded in putting it off , such persons should have money to go out of the way to prevent their being summoned . `` ] —Now , sir , these are the allegations contained in the petition , which I hope the house will excuse me for having thus specifically read , for the purpose of shewing how specific notice is given to these persons of the charges against them , and the nature of the evidence to be brought.—Sir , in support of this petition , you have heard 8 witnesses examined , the witnesses named in the petition , and if they are deserving of credit , upon which subject undoubtedly the house are to decide , but respecting whom it was quite impossible for those who produced them to know , otherwise than that their testimony on paper , or all the account which could be discovered of them was favorable to the testimony they were to give ; and such , as induced all those who heard them , truly and honestly to believe the truth of their statement—if their
