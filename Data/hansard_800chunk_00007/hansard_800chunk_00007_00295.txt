They immediately withdrew it . But his majesty having accompanied his dissent by a very singular demand—namely , that they should give in writing a promise never to mention the subject to him again , they felt themselves obliged to acquaint him , in a firm , but respectful manner , that their sense of duty would not allow them to abstain from offering to him from time to time , such advice upon this and all other subjects , as his interests , and the interests of his empire , might in their judgement require . Upon this , his majesty resolved to dismiss them his service—following , no doubt , the advice of most disinterested persons , of persons who were not to profit by the change , and who had no other object at heart than to give to their country the strongest and wisest government that could be formed , at a time of the greatest danger by which it was ever menaced ! —Now , sir , in all this , I can see no insolence , no folly , no desire to insult their sovereign , no deep-laid plot for making themselves Mayors of the Palace , nothing that could endanger 444 the establishment and call upon the right hon . and learned gent . opposite me to desert that profession of which he was an ornament , to quit the study of the year-book for that of your finance reports , and to take upon himself the lucrative office of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster , for life if he could , or if not for life , for so long as he can hold it , in order , I presume , the better to enable him to make that gallant stand for the religion of his country , of which he has himself made such honourable mention in his address to his constituents.—And now , sir , that I have mentioned this address , I can not forbear stating to the house , the impression it made upon my wind , and which it was , naturally , though I am sure unintentionally , calculated to produce .

To deal quite fairly with the house , as I shall always feel myself bound to do , even at the certainty of differing from , and the hazard of offending those for whom I have most esteem and most regard , I must confess , that if there is any thing in the course of this transaction for which I should be inclined to cast blame upon the late ministers , it would be upon grounds very different from those that have generally been taken . That they went far enough in concession , I am quite sure—my only doubt is , whether they did not go too far . I am inclined to think that upon the strict principles of better times , of times more
